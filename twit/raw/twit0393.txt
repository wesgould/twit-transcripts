[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   sent this.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   All right.

[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.480]   I'm in Northern Kentucky right near Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.480]   Just south of Cincinnati.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.400]   I thought Louisville was just across the river.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.120]   It's just across the river from Indiana.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   Yeah, that's where all the brodos are.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Nobody sent me this t-shirt.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   I paid money for it.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   Stand up.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   Let's see it.

[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120]   He's got a little swooshy.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   Men's basketball.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   It's got swooshy on it.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.680]   Ryan Shrout, the host of this week in computer hardware and editor in chief of PC perspective
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.320]   at PC Burt.com.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.560]   And he's on for a very special, actually, couple of things I want to talk about.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.000]   But the PS4 and the PlayStation, but also I want to talk about Haswell.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   We'll do that in a moment.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.400]   Also with us, Natalie Morris.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.080]   Great to have you back.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   Thank you.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.320]   I won't be standing up to modeling my clothes.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.440]   No, that's quite all right.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   No need.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440]   Are you wearing any team sweatshirts, however?
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   No.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   Nothing.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   Giants?
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   No, I'm not.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.440]   No, I'm not.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   That's got to be tough.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.880]   You're in a mixed family, a mixed relationship.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.960]   Clayton Morris is a Phillies fan of all things.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   I know.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   And they're not winners.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.960]   That's horrible.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   The Giants are.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   How about football?
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   Obviously, you would be a Niners fan.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   Yes.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.240]   I don't want to talk about that.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   I know.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.960]   We were there and it was sad.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.280]   I know I'm still bummed.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   It was almost like someone broke up with me.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.320]   I woke up the next day just feeling a little bit of heartbreak.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.880]   Yeah, I felt that way too.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   It's interesting.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.520]   You would take it so hard.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   I know, right?
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   But you do.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   Sports ball.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   You do.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520]   It's just a game.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.240]   Also with this, if I go all the way, for some reason, I have two people from Kentucky
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.240]   on the show.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240]   It's odd.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   I don't know how that happened.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.720]   Jason Heider from Tech Republic.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.720]   Jason, good to see you.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   Hey, always good to be here, Leo.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   Are you rooting for a team?
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.440]   Indiana Hoosiers all the way.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   I think the win.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.440]   Oh, see, you are.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.640]   You are just over the river from Indiana.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   That's why.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   I am Louisville.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.680]   I live in Louisville.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.120]   Tech Republic is the headquarters of our editorial apartment is in Louisville.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.320]   It always has been, but I'm not from Louisville or Kentucky.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   I'm from Indiana.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   But it wasn't too far to come from.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.720]   You know, I always say this when he's on, he sounds just like Max Kellerman.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   Yeah, every single time.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.160]   Who is Max Kellerman?
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.120]   Max Kellerman is an analyst.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   He has been for a while, but he does mostly boxing now.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.600]   And he's a boxing man.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.040]   Oh, you're talking kid freeze.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   What?
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.040]   That's what they call him.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   No.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.840]   I don't know what you mean.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.200]   I don't know either apparently.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   Kid freeze.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.840]   Well, now that we have all the affiliations out of the way, we can move on to the tech news.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.640]   And I got an email from somebody who said, you know, I'm just not going to listen to
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.160]   Twitter until you stop talking about sports because I'm a geek and I'm not interested
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   in sports.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:40.640]   Well, for him, specifically, I want to thank Stephen Thompson and David Helm.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.800]   They go to North Dakota State.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.120]   Oh, they're around there.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.160]   And so the one, I think it was nice.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.480]   Is this basically your, how you get your wardrobe?
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.480]   Yes.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   Stephen Thompson gave me this one.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   I got a championship one from Helm.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   That's nice.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   Right.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.600]   So listen to it on this show, that's the only reason I thought it'd be a good idea to
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   do that.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.080]   You don't do this on no agenda, just on this show?
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.080]   Yes.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   Okay, every show.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.820]   No, just this show.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.040]   This show only and only once in a while.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.800]   But it was certainly sufficiently that it's become your reputation.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.640]   I've got no kinds of Appalachian State stuff and others.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.200]   Well, hey, if we're going to talk about designers, we want to be sending us stuff.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.040]   Hey, Kate Spade, call me.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040]   Call me.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.360]   I could use a purse.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.800]   Any championship teams out there.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.600]   I'd like to thank you personally, Michael Kors.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.440]   You know, we are apparently up against the most elegant of award shows the streamies
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440]   are on right now.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.440]   The streamies?
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.440]   The streamies.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.080]   It sounds like a perfect one.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.880]   Is that an award for incontinence?
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.200]   Um, that's the point.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.560]   It's a gala event going on right now.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.160]   Let's just, why don't we just check in and see, because I think I just deemed this fancy
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.920]   enough dress that I don't want to go.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.120]   See, this is like a big time award show.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.520]   Wow, I never heard of it.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   Look at that.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.520]   They've got moving sets.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.520]   Looks slick.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.880]   They've got people in fancy dress.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.560]   Is that people in folding chairs?
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   Look at that.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.920]   That is fancy.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.360]   We need to do some award shows.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.600]   That's Larry King.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.080]   Thank you.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.360]   And Jenna Marbles, well, I love Jenna Marbles.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.280]   I've never heard of Jenna Marbles.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   Oh, you see these, she's huge in the YouTube crowds.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   She's huge.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.640]   They've got 6,000 people in their chat room.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.800]   Which is which.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.080]   So if you'd like to tune that in, would you, you know, we should just run this in the background.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.080]   You know, we are going to be doing live.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.080]   That's going to be very strange.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.080]   Is that going to be very strange?
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.080]   I don't even, I don't, yes.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.080]   I've never heard of them.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080]   Yes.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.360]   You know, I didn't actually stand up because I'm wearing those same pants.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.080]   Jenna Marbles pants?
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.960]   The pleather leggings.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   Nothing like it.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.680]   I thought Larry King was dead years ago.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.360]   I'm just shocked to see him still.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.320]   Oh, not only have a life, but walking.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   You were on the Larry King show.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   I've been on the show.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.000]   He looked shorter than I think he's.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Maybe he's shrinking.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   That could happen.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   That's a body.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That's a body double.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   That's kind of a game.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   He's not.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   That's not right.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.800]   I think he's somewhere being watered.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.520]   I think he's probably have him on the juice.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.040]   On the, well, there was a lot of stories this week.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:16.000]   Microsoft, one week ago shipped its Surface Pro, the Windows Pro tablet, and sold out
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.440]   of the 128 gig version almost immediately.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.280]   We were a little puzzled last week about what the heck happened now.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.960]   I went to the Microsoft store and the radio button is live.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.040]   So you can still order, you can now order a 128 gig Surface Pro, but it won't be available
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   to March 15th.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040]   Was it scam?
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.040]   No, it won't be available to March 15th.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.480]   I figured it out.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.480]   Okay.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.560]   It's on the carnival triumph and they've been towing it.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.280]   And people have been pooping on it.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.320]   They've been towing it from China.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.520]   How many Ryan Shrout?
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.720]   I'm sure you guys talked about this.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.440]   How many Surface Pro, 128 gigs do you think they made?
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.760]   When they say sell out, was it sell out of millions?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.760]   No, no.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   I think so.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   No.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   You're talking about six.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.480]   You're talking about stores having six apiece and that kind of stuff?
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.640]   No, I don't think that would be 1800 approximately.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.360]   They sold on Florence Kentucky too.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.120]   I mean, I went to Best Buy trying to find any capacity and they didn't have any here,
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   either.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.320]   They sold out on Sunday when they launched.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.800]   They said that Best Buy's got from zero to three.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   Okay.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   Well, mine was zero.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   Mine was zero.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   It can have zero.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.240]   That's what it said.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.320]   Can't have zero.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.600]   We got from zero to three, you guess.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.040]   That's the absence of having zero.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.720]   And then, most of them were, I guess, went to the Microsoft store.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.640]   But I don't think even the Microsoft store had very many.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.640]   No.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:46.120]   Like 20, I think the estimate was somewhere between 20 to 50 is what the Microsoft store
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.120]   has had.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.800]   So, I mean, we're talking maybe high of 50,000 to 75,000 total that were out there, I think,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.360]   is some of the best estimates that I've seen.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.960]   And it's not the best Windows 8 tablet out there, even now, right?
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.920]   I mean, I guess I understand it's kind of like a Google phone.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.200]   People want the, you know, somehow official because it came from Microsoft.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   It says Google.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   You have it.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   That's a nexus, right?
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   And then, you know, the other thing is, is what are the corporate orders?
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.160]   And, you know, that's not something they normally release.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.480]   But if they're really going to brag, they've been saying this is going to be a big enterprise
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.480]   tablet.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.400]   So, you know, you don't see CTOs and CIOs just moseying on down to the store and, you
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.280]   know, coming out with an arm full of service for their workforce.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.920]   So I don't think they're going to release that, but that's the real question.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.640]   Well, I mean, they would typically get them direct, you know, sold, you know, a pallet
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.160]   of them or whatever, sold direct.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   But of all the, there's certainly interest among the enterprise.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.920]   We've heard that for the past six months.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   But I haven't heard one single CIO or CTO of the ones we talked to that said, I'm ordering
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   a hundred of these or, you know, 500 or a thousand.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.040]   I haven't heard any say that they're going to, they're, that they were planning to order
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.720]   them at launch a bunch of them.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.800]   A lot of them were planning to trial it.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.160]   They were planning to get it in to get some in and order them and, you know, try it out
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:14.080]   in some trials, two, three, five, you know, tablets from zero to three in every company,
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.080]   every fortune 500 company.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   Right.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.040]   But even if it had been hundreds, then that would be a case study that we would know about.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.360]   And you'd have to think that maybe they'll, you know, pick a few select corporations and
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.560]   maybe give them hundreds and get that ball rolling.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.560]   And then they would sure.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.560]   Sure.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.320]   Jason, Jason, you covered.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.560]   This is your, this is what tech republic covers.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.240]   What is the reaction from business to windows eight?
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.400]   So I mean, it's been surprisingly.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   Tepid.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   Luke warm.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   Right.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   Surprisingly really.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.560]   Well, because in terms of what they're buying, right, because people leading up to
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.960]   windows eight, for whatever reason they people talk to big game like, yeah, absolutely,
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.280]   we're open to bringing it.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.240]   You know, we can bring these kinds of tablets in surface and they'll immediately connect
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.760]   to our infrastructure, you know, active directory to whatever back end windows systems they
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.160]   have, windows servers.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.200]   You know, people talk to big game like that, all leading up to RT and pro both.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   Right.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.400]   But when you actually ask them, what have you bought?
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.720]   There's very few that are talking about getting lots of them, right, ordering lots of them.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.880]   And there's been lots more interest around pro than, than RT in all honestly.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.880]   Right.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.880]   So yeah, yeah.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:38.240]   But so I wasn't surprised that they sold out of, you know, 50 to 70,000 of them.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.040]   But I don't think that that's a bigger, an example of the fact that there's a ton of
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.840]   demand for this product because there certainly isn't, as you mentioned, Leo, you know, there
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.360]   are other tablets that even can do this a little better.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.720]   It's really powerful tablet.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   I reviewed it.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.640]   And at the end, I said, if I were recommending this to a pro, I would have a hard time saying,
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:04.400]   get this instead of something like the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet to, which is really nice.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.400]   It does a lot more.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   And it's not as power.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.480]   It doesn't have as powerful a processor, but you can get, you know, wireless broadband
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.720]   in it, mobile broadband.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.040]   You can, it's got 10 hours of battery life.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   The pen is built in.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.680]   It doesn't have as nice as a screen.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.200]   It doesn't have as big of a processor.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.920]   But in the end, you know, it's going to do a lot more for you.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:28.120]   I will say, so much of the enterprise is still lagging and upgrading to Windows 8 anyway.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.080]   So, you know, you're, you know, you're, you're, you're, you know, this is, sorry, go ahead.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080]   No, you go ahead.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.520]   I didn't mean interrupt.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   That was the main crux of my mind.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.760]   I mean, they're stuck with Windows 7.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   Go ahead, Ryan.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   You were going to say something.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.840]   I was just saying, I have that, that ThinkPad tablet too right here.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.440]   And I do like the device, but in terms of it being, it's, it's a major step backwards
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   in terms of performance.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.040]   This is an atom based processor.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.160]   It has an Ivy bridge based processor.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.440]   It's okay for doing some stuff.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.800]   But if you're actually, you know, needing to do some, some, you know, basic computing
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.720]   intensive stuff, this is going to struggle with it, whereas the Surface Pro will breeze
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   right through.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.760]   Well, and this brings up something I was going to ask you anyway, Ryan.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.480]   Shouldn't people who are buying hardware today wait until has well?
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:17.040]   Well, I mean, in June, in June Intel will do the talk, which is the big upgrade processor
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.840]   upgrade with has well, and there are three has well parts.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.200]   One is all there actually two are very low power.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.760]   One is ultra low power.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.360]   It seems like those would be a, you know, battery life will be better.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.880]   They'll be, they'll be able to do things that Apple does right now.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.680]   There's like this power nap where even when the, with the system sleeping, they'll be
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.600]   able to get mail and update things.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.040]   It just seems like it's going to be a better platform for Windows 8.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.760]   Windows 8 is built to take advantage of power and app style.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.760]   Has the architecture that was designed for that infrastructure, right?
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.360]   Connected standby and type of stuff.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.120]   And it will have much lower power states that it can go into.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.040]   The problem with waiting is depending on what your cycle happens to be when has well launches
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.960]   in the middle of the year, it's going to launch the high powered versions initially.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.960]   Quadrant.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.080]   When did the use, when did the use come out the low power?
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.560]   You know, I think you're going to, you're going to have to wait until fall to start seeing
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:15.160]   those roll out and probably into the winter before, you know, you're starting to see more
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.600]   than just a couple of skews out there using that really, you know, low power.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.840]   It also has faster GPU, right?
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.560]   So I mean, in every respect this has improved and it seems to me that if a company is looking
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.920]   at Windows 8, they can be very happy saying, yeah, we'll wait till the fall, right?
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.440]   Well, yeah, the comp, you have to make too many compromises with the Surface Pro as it
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.440]   is now.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.760]   But it's not that it's a bad product.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.240]   The idea, you know, as Ryan said, you get a lot of power.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.000]   So it comes into this conundrum though, right?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.280]   Because you've got all this power.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.680]   The idea is you're getting all of this sort of laptop power in a tablet form factor that's
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   mobile.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.240]   And so the biggest thing is now you're getting, you know, all of this power in this very mobile
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.720]   device, although this device still weighs two pounds, right?
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.360]   But you can't be mobile with the device because it's only got four hours of battery life.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.720]   What are you going to do?
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.840]   You're going to use it to what jump between conference rooms from day to day where it's
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.840]   a laptop.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.960]   You might as well just face it, you're going to keep it plugged in.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.480]   Yeah, it's got to be plugged in.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.120]   You're not going to have it for more than you're not going to be able to use it for anything
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.400]   more than, you know, jump in conference rooms for some meetings because it's not a very
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.720]   mobile device because of that.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.680]   But Ryan, won't we see it has well?
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.440]   Won't we see battery lives more like, you know, 50% to 100% better?
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.720]   I don't know for sure what the percentage like will be, but Intel has really changed
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.360]   what their design goals are on a process to process product, product release, right?
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.640]   They're not really interested in improving performance anymore.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.960]   Ivy Bridge is not that big of improvement over Sandy Bridge, which wasn't the big of
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.480]   improvement in general and has well.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.080]   And so if you look at the CPU side, it's not going to be a huge improvement in performance.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.280]   What they're focusing on is that low power management.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.680]   So their goals now are, can we get the same level of performance you get today at half
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.520]   the battery life or half the voltage, half the, you know, the power draw required thus
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.720]   increasing your battery life.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.280]   You know, we've been hearing this from Intel forever.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.840]   I mean, 10 years ago, they'll get there.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.400]   I'm not sure they will.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.880]   I'm actually not sure this could be this has well could be has been.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.200]   And there you have the headline.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.480]   I just wrote in my market watch column.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.680]   They've really as of, you know, you go back to where the original Centrino launched, right?
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.760]   And that's they had a complete reshift there.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.560]   They've had another one since then when they kind of wrote off AMD as being their primary
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.280]   competitor and decided that Qualcomm is their new primary competitor and arm in Qualcomm
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.920]   specifically, but arm in general.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.920]   Right.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920]   Right.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.920]   Right.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   Because it does, you know, interesting analysis, less fall from a non tech, which I just got
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.040]   around to reading, which he said, basically, that's the threat is that computing is moving
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:57.120]   to tablet and smartphone, all of which is arm based Intel doesn't have a, you know, they
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.840]   try to clover trail maybe, but they don't really have an arm competitor.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   They got to get a chip that can get into a portable small device, get good battery life,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.080]   not take up a lot of room.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   And that's where they're moving.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.600]   They are moving not, as you said, not, they don't have to beat AMD.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.760]   They have to beat arm and they need to do it without giving up the performance that we
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   have already, right?
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.560]   If you look at clover trail, that's what this is like an atom processor and it's, and
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   it's okay.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   It will work.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   It will function.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.760]   It will do some of the stuff that you want to do, but I think your typical laptop user,
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.280]   whether it's a business or a consumer, doesn't want to give up the performance that they
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.240]   have today to go back to like an Android based tablet where they, where you see that performance
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.040]   degradation has hit.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   Right.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:45.280]   I think the problem is ultimately that I think people are asking the wrong question and trying
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.880]   to do the wrong things with tablets.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.440]   Ultimately, if you, if you want the power of a laptop, then you don't need it in a tablet.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.040]   I mean, that's ultimately what the conclusion I came to when I was using the pro and testing
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.880]   it out, heading up, going into the launch.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.040]   And I thought, this is a good device.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.040]   It's beautiful.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   It's well made.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.080]   But if I wanted to do all of this, it still has to compete with a laptop and I'd rather
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.800]   use a laptop.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.320]   It's not as good as a laptop.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.360]   And so if you're trying to make a tablet be as powerful and do as much as a laptop,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.960]   you're always going to be disappointed because it's just different things.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.320]   I'm a smart producer though, and I think that the entire reason that Apple just released
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:27.000]   this 128 gig iPad is because they see a lot of people who are not content producers need
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.960]   that power because they're in the field and they need a lot of content being pushed to
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.880]   them, not necessarily to produce content.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.360]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.680]   I don't know.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.520]   You're pharmaceutical sales and you need your entire catalog of knee or hip replacements,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.520]   John.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.960]   Then, you know, I'm sorry.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   What?
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   Nothing.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.880]   I don't need a hip replacement.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   You just woke him up now.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.960]   Or a knee replacement.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.200]   I'm sure I can do things.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.560]   And by the way, I don't reckon, everyone I know has got a knee replacement is limping
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.560]   around.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.080]   But you need that tablet and a tablet works for you, Natalie.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.920]   I mean, it's totally true.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.760]   I think they should be doing, you know, that the kind of thing, big storage, faster processor,
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.720]   more video, but it works in that form factor.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.520]   And I think the stuff that a lot of Windows 8 machines, including the service Pro, are
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.720]   trying to do is trying to say, well, if you're a laptop user, here's the tablet for you.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   Well, if you're a laptop user, you don't need that.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.680]   The form factor doesn't work for you.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.200]   You don't need that form factor.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.800]   And most of them don't want that form factor.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.280]   They want to use a laptop for the work that they need to do.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.280]   So I just, this is losing the position.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.480]   But then you have the issue of connectivity then because a laptop, you know, what were
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   those?
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.640]   Sony Vio books that had 4G, like those didn't take off.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   What did we call them?
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.280]   Ultra mobile PCs.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.160]   That was partly because Intel's chip was so low powered was so not.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.000]   So so and performance.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   It was terrible.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.640]   But we still don't see ultra books with connectivity yet.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.640]   Right.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   So it's still the tablets that have the connectivity.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.840]   Well, you mean you don't have ultra books with connectivity?
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   What are you talking about?
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   No, she means 3G.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   Where'd you write?
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   Right.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.480]   You mean anything other than Wi-Fi is what I mean.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.480]   Yeah, you can still get it.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.160]   I mean, if you want it, just not as many laptop users for whatever reason don't want it.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.600]   But in Lenovo, Lenovo offers it with through mobile broadband chips.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.200]   And you can get them in laptops.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.840]   You know, it's the same chips that running in tablets.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.240]   It's just the demand for them isn't as high.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   Right.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.600]   It's just that didn't take off like I thought it would.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.920]   It's just rare, right?
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.040]   You don't see it that often.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:40.840]   So I guess we're talking about maybe a one size solution and there is no such thing.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.040]   So I think what people want is they want great battery life, but they don't want to give
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   up performance.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   They want a light and simple form factor.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.240]   They want always on connectivity.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.080]   Can has well be the solution for this, Ryan?
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   I think it can.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.600]   And I think what you have to start thinking about are different form factors.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.160]   The convertible tablets into laptops as those designs mature and get better.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.360]   I really do believe that that's kind of what it's going to become.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.000]   You're going to have a laptop.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.840]   You know, imagine if this was a lot more powerful.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.040]   There's a dock that you can plug it into that then has video outputs and HDMI and Thunderbolt
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.080]   and all that kind of stuff on it.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.000]   So you take it with you and you get 10 or 12 hours of battery life with you when you
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.560]   go, you come back home, you plug it in and all your storage is connected.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:27.040]   Maybe you've got an external discrete graphics card in there if you want to do games and
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.040]   that kind of stuff.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:33.120]   And that is what has well will enable because that is a chip that is designed to run it in
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.520]   extremely low voltage and get longer battery life.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.200]   But then if you pump some power into it, you can get high performance as well.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   Perfect.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.000]   I think it's one of those things typical until always tries to do this.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.080]   They always find ways to turn the chip off or turn it on.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   Yeah, it's a speed step.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   And they get it all down the end.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.520]   If you ever use one of these machines because I have a desktop that's got one of these chips
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.760]   in it, you hit the key and you wait because the chip is saying, I think I better start
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   working now.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.920]   15, 20 seconds to wait that long.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.920]   You got to wait a millisecond.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   We're going to have a problem.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.920]   It is not related to a chip.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   It's like really?
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.920]   You mean me now?
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   We're so spoiled, right?
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.920]   We want it to be so instant.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.920]   We want that instant connectivity.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.800]   I remember we used to wait for so many things, right?
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.080]   It's 20, 13 for God's sake.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.080]   And we don't.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.920]   We're the flying cars.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.800]   I will say the one cool thing about the Service Pro that was cool.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.520]   And I think where the product is pretty groundbreaking and we'll have an influence is it was the first
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.960]   time that I used a one of these kind of hybrid devices because I've used several of these
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.680]   as well where the touch and the type worked together pretty well.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.320]   And it was the first time that I thought, yeah, you know what, this makes sense.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   And it has a pen computing.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:50.680]   I've never been a real big fan of pen computing, but the pen on that is so accurate and precise
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:57.600]   that it can go down to really thin lines, right where you touch on the tablet with the pen.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.560]   It goes right there was on some of these tablets.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.400]   It's like you're touching on one part of the screen and it's like half an inch above
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.800]   that is where you're actually you see it.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   And it's a really jarring experience.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.240]   This one worked really well.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   The touch like touch is just better for some things like scrolling to a specific part of
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.560]   a page or flipping through images.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.280]   You know, it's natural to sort of want to flip through them on the screen and it does
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.640]   work better versus some things obviously are better for just typing and using a mouse and
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   keyboard.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.200]   And so it's the first device I used where touch and sort of traditional input and pen kind
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.280]   of all worked together pretty well.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.760]   Did you see the meteor from Russia?
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.760]   What about the meeting?
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.760]   We're going to talk about it when we come back.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.200]   Apparently all those what it's cool the big flying fireball.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.160]   What's wrong with that, John?
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160]   That's tech.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   We talk about it.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.880]   So you're listening to the show today because it was like a bet going on that you weren't
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.280]   going to talk about this.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   Really?
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.800]   So did I take it you bet that I would not?
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   Because you're so disgruntled.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   Exactly.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.680]   Afterwards Russian dashboard cams.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   That's the future.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.760]   We're going to be back with more really yet a bet that I wouldn't.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.000]   I kind of yes I did.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.760]   I love that kind of stuff.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.280]   So you're telling me about the fireball.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.320]   That was coming in at 33,000 miles.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.040]   The size of a kitchen table and it was the size of a kitchen table and it hit that lake
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.080]   and made a perfect hole instead of blowing the thing the smithereens and breaking all the
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.080]   ice.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.080]   That one you're talking about?
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.240]   Did it really?
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.160]   It made a perfect hole in the ice.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.880]   It didn't blow the thing the smithereens like you'd think it would.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.880]   It's bogus.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.880]   Anyway.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   You have to listen to the last Noah Janus.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.880]   Noah Janus showed that story.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.880]   Noah Janus showed that kind of story.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   Oh, we got a story.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.880]   One of the conspirators who think it was a thing.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   It was a thing.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.120]   You got a hole in the ice.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.880]   A perfect hole in the ice so big.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.960]   This thing hit at 33,000 miles an hour and that's all that it goes and makes a perfect
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.840]   hole and doesn't blow the water out of there.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.000]   But Russian science has confirmed it.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Time for a Mythbusters everyone.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.800]   Just making an observation.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.600]   I'm not saying it's a conspiracy.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.120]   I want to know what you think it is but we'll find out in just a moment.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.000]   That's a good tease before we go to our break.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   You're listening to Twit, watching it too.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.840]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   Ryan Shratt, we want to talk about the PlayStation 4 in just a little bit Wednesday.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.320]   The big release date.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.240]   Ryan has some insider information.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   Natalie Morris.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.000]   What are you doing these days, Natalie?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.800]   You're working for somebody, huh?
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.960]   I still sometimes go on CNBC and I've got a couple freelance projects that I'm doing as
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   well.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.480]   But the mommy duty is taking over a lot of your life?
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.360]   Oh, yeah, that's definitely.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.000]   I work for these two little ones a lot more than anyone else.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.240]   I have the sweetest kids.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   Oh, thanks.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.320]   But yeah, I'm launching a new project soon that I'll tell you all about.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   Good.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.760]   And you're getting an MBA, it says.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.680]   Yeah, I'm doing that.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   Wow.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   Crazy.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.680]   That's awesome.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   Adam says.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.680]   Adam says science.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.680]   Shut up already.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   John, we can't do science.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   Science.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.440]   All right, we might have to get Adam Curry on to find out what really happened.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.440]   Here's your real decision.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.720]   Yeah, I like your response.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.680]   Ah, Russian media on Twitter.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   All right.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:19.040]   Natalie's here and also Jason Hire from Tech Republic, the man who had me elected president
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.200]   of the internet, a title which I have not yet seated, although Alexis O'Haney and seems
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.920]   to want it.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   We will be back.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   Huh?
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   Lifetime.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   It's lifetime.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.920]   I think it's a lifetime job.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   Science.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.040]   Is Adam arguing on the side of science or against?
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.680]   No, he's got even a wackier theory than mine.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   Great.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.240]   I can't wait to hear it when we come back first.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.480]   Let me show you this.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.480]   Mems.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.080]   Microelectromechanical machines.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   Systems.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.000]   Systems.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.920]   They, John and I are trying to figure out if there's a MEMS in there.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.840]   Oh, there's obviously a MEMS in that.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.320]   Because there's no moving parts, but then Chad says, no, the feet move.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   The feet don't move.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   Let's see.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   Yeah, they do.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   There's a little.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.960]   So we're talking about this kale that you get.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.720]   Yeah, the feet might move, but there's a MEM behind one of these things.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.720]   Okay.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   Okay.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.280]   There's an inset on something.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.960]   There's obviously some sort of a view.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.200]   Geeks will debate anything.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.200]   It's a MEM.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   There's a MEM inside.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.760]   It's the only way you can make this work.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.840]   It is a five pound scale from stamps.com and it's yours free, MEM or not.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.920]   We don't know if you become a stamps.com user.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:30.400]   Now I got to tell you, you do not need stamps.com if you are not going to the post office.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.800]   If you're occasionally making a trip down in the mailbox, this isn't for you.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.760]   This is for the postage pro.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:42.680]   The person who's business relies on mailing invoices or marketing material or packages.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.960]   Maybe you sell on eBay or Amazon or Etsy or an Etsy seller.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.040]   You got to know about stamps.com.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.800]   Stance.com lets you buy and print US postage on your computer, your printer.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.440]   You don't need a Lisa postage meter.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.520]   You don't ever need to go to the post office.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.520]   You don't need special ink.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.920]   You just need stamps.com and the stuff you've already got.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.560]   It'll print right on envelopes with your logo, the return address.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.360]   It'll take the recipients address from your QuickBooks, your address book.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.440]   If you're selling on Amazon or eBay or any one of those websites, it takes it right off
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.520]   the website.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.520]   It prints the postage.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.760]   It's legal postage.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.640]   It does it all for you automatically.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.280]   If you have the scale, you just plop any package or letter on there and you always know exactly
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.000]   how much postage to put on.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   It's really fantastic.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   You even get discounts.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.160]   You just can't get it to the post office.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.240]   Up to 21% off Express Mail, 15% off Priority Mail.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.280]   If you're using Express or Priority Mail, it will offer to email your recipient with
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.640]   a tracking number and all of that.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.440]   It is just a really great solution.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   I want you to try it.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.360]   Right now, we've got a no risk trial offer for you.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.120]   If you go to the website stamps.com, you'll see the $80 value.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.120]   Don't do that.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.160]   It's an old fashioned microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.360]   Enter our offer code TWIT.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.800]   That $80 value turns to a $110 bonus value.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.680]   You know you've got the right place when you see my shining face.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.200]   That's $110.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   It's $55 in free postage that you can use over the first few months of your subscription.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.480]   You get the digital scale.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.200]   You pay shipping and handling for that.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.600]   Just a few bucks.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.760]   But the scale is yours to keep.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.760]   You can cancel at any time.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:20.280]   It's $5 supply kit to make up for the shipping and handling and a four week trial of stamps.com.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.000]   If you run a business, if you do fulfillment of any kind, it is an absolute must.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   You'd be crazy not to do it.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.760]   Stamps.com, make sure you use our offer code TWIT for the best no risk trial offer.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.920]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   Long time advertiser.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.200]   I'm a long time user of stamps.com.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.840]   I got to find somewhere I have Leo stamps that I made.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.120]   I thought a war had broken out.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.960]   The blast shattered windows and knocked down a wall at this zinc factory.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.800]   See it knocked down a wall at a zinc factory.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   Yes, me.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.680]   It made a perfect hole in a lake when I didn't do anything else to the lake.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.680]   This makes no sense.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.360]   It had used up all its energy.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.960]   No, you haven't you.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.600]   It's like if you shoot a bullet.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.440]   And by the way, it's coming in at an angle.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.080]   You think it would do a little more damage than a perfectly.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.000]   You ever shot a bullet through pain and glass?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.160]   That's what I do on the weekends.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.160]   Does it break the whole window?
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   No.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.520]   It's a little puncture because it's a high velocity, high impact.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.960]   It's a 220 swift one of those high velocity real.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.560]   Those huge shells with a little bitty bullet on the air.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   And throw that at it and win.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   Don't see what it does.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   Well, smash it.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.560]   It'll blow the thing right out of the wall.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.320]   Well, sometimes though, it just makes a little hole.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   Yeah, 22.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.320]   Boom.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.320]   Yeah, sure.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.320]   All right.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.840]   Beebe's by the way, same effect.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.840]   Beebe's.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.840]   Very little damage.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   All right.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   So you think, so what's the conspiracy?
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.360]   Well, you know, it's explained in more detail in noagendashow.com.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.920]   I'll give you Adams a little thing.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:47.480]   He believes that surreptitiously all these guys who keep saying they want to mine.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   And you've seen these guys.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   That's a rude miner.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   It's all those.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.480]   It's the Google voice.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   Do you think they got one with a big mag in it?
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.160]   I think there was something was going on and they nicked the thing and it sent these,
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.000]   it sent a, that's what Adam thinks.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.160]   It nicked the thing and sent a bunch of meteors because there was three meteor here.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.160]   Look at it.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   There was one over the bay area.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.160]   Look at it.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   The size of a table.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   Yeah, there was one over the bay area.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.680]   They were in Cuba and they all happened at the same time and it was all within that,
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.440]   kind of within the realm of this, this 17,000 foot asteroid.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.480]   What does Sarah Palin say?
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.120]   She says, "Get out of Alaska."
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.480]   I don't know what she says.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   So now you're right.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.760]   There was another and nobody's talking about there was, there was another hit or maybe a
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   light in the sky.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760]   I don't know.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.240]   The San Francisco hit the water and then there was one in Cuba.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.880]   What about the thousands of people who were hurt in the Russian meteor strike?
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.760]   That actually hit a popular area.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.560]   It was that it was a Chinese rocket though.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.120]   No, that's a, now that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   Right.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.320]   That's a different, I read that on NBC News that there are conspirators who think that
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.520]   it was a Chinese rocket.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.960]   Yeah, well we're not there.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.960]   It hit with a force of 30.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   You've gone down a different route.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.520]   Well I was like, nobody, if it was a Chinese rocket, what about this round hole in the ice?
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.200]   I mean that's the thing that gets me.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.560]   What do you think it's going to do?
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.880]   Why don't we have to get, there it is.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.360]   What does that sound like?
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.160]   That was a sonic boom, I think.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.560]   That was a sonic boom.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.240]   I don't think that was the thing hitting.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.400]   Yeah, sonic boom should do that.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:21.080]   When I was a kid, what's so interesting about this is how many videos there are of it.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:26.200]   Because of these Russian dashboard cams, everybody's apparently got one on their car
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.680]   or all the taxis have one.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.000]   I've never seen so many videos from this thing.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   It's incredible.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.200]   Look at this.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.040]   There's a dashboard cam.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   So we can just...
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   This is well documented.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:44.120]   We're just such an occasion.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.600]   I still don't know.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.920]   So you're thinking, now how come this one's got no trail?
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.360]   The other one had a big trail.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   This one's got no trail.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   There's a trail.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   There's a trail.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   It's a minor.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   Well it's just a different, maybe a different event.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.480]   Do you think it's a different one?
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.880]   The one that they should have been doing, they did the computer animation.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.520]   They showed this thing coming into Russia with four trailers for little guys before
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.160]   lying here.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.600]   Well, that's the question.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.160]   Well, every conspiracy theory, you have to have somebody lying.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   Lying.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.440]   Who's actively deceiving people.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.760]   I don't think there's enough time for any lies to be formed yet.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.560]   I think, yeah.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.560]   There's just a...
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.720]   We're not going to talk about DORNER next, are we?
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   No.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.720]   Good.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.720]   Two?
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.720]   Big time.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.720]   I got to listen to know it.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.720]   We have the two shows that show...
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.520]   The DORNER show and then the Meteor Show.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.720]   The last Thursday show, we got a lot of good DORNER show.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   Now, but you're considered...
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   Here's the DORNER.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.520]   You're considered the Buzzkill and he's considered the crackpot.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.520]   Yeah, he's the crackpot.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.520]   So he comes in with these theories and then...
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.520]   He doesn't...
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.520]   You don't seem like they're doing much of a job killing him.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.520]   You're not...
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.320]   He's convincing me on a couple of these things.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.760]   He's starting to win because he's got the backup information.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.240]   He plays, he's like so paranoid.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.120]   He plays for the DORNER thing.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.560]   He played the tape or the recording of the news report.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.040]   We know where DORNER is.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.200]   We found his wallet at the...
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   They found his wallet at the border.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.440]   Then they found his same wallet again in the cabin.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.920]   How did they find his wallet over and over again?
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.320]   Guys, what happened to the wallet I had from DORNER?
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   Must have dropped it.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.960]   I mean, the DORNER thing is a complete scam.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.960]   All right.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.280]   I don't know if we can give that...
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.280]   I signed that at Tech Angle.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.280]   No, no.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.200]   At least the fiery ball has a Tech Angle.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.640]   There was guns involved.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   That's kind of tech.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   By the way...
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   Hey, by the way, talk about tech.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.640]   I saw...
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.520]   Remember the little Shatner thing called Tech Wars?
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.520]   It was a TV show?
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.520]   Anyone remember Tech Wars?
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.520]   They do.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.520]   He does.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.520]   So it was a Shatner show?
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.520]   What about it?
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.600]   It has the word tech in it.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.160]   All right.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   Good.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   Good segue there.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.520]   By the way, John and I are going to be doing our bit...
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.040]   What do you call those old guys in the...?
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.200]   Yeah, we're going to do a Wallace and Gromit.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   No.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   Who are the old guys in this?
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.040]   Oh, Riley and somebody, I think, is the old guys.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.040]   Oh, the Muppet guys.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.040]   Yeah, the Muppet guys.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.040]   Yeah, we'll be doing that all the week.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.600]   We'll be doing that at the...
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   I mean...
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   No, not Ernie.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   What are you?
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   The Muppet...
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   The old Muppet...
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.600]   The Stattler and Waldorf.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.960]   We'll be doing our Stattler and Waldorf thing at the Radio Inc Convergence Conference, March
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   4th and 5th.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.080]   Actually, we'll be on March 4th in Santa Clara.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.520]   Tech icons, Leo, the Portant John C. Devorah, keynote.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.440]   Oh, is it going to be a keynote?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.000]   Well, I think you and I are just going to chat back and forth.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   We're going to be seated.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   We're going to be in chairs.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Yeah, we'll be seated.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.040]   We don't know the roles that you're going to be playing and you don't know that it's
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   going to be a keynote.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.040]   So you're well prepared, you guys.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040]   Oh, the...
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   We're just going to show up.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   They're going to put us up on the stage.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.040]   Got to march.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.040]   We got to march for it.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   Besides that, we can add Lib through the whole thing.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.040]   I love how...
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.040]   Well, that's my point.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.040]   It's only...
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.040]   The name's...
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.040]   It says this right here.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.960]   The name's Leo, the Portant John C. Devorah, strike fear into the heart of tech companies.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.960]   Really?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   I didn't know that.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.960]   Do we have gas or something?
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.040]   I mean, what would be the deal?
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.840]   A rare appearance of the two men together for a keynote, March 5th.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.840]   A rare appearance.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   A rare appearance.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.360]   Well, yeah, it was probably somewhat true.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   Who wrote that?
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.360]   They're trying to keep up.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.880]   We're rarely live on stage together.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.040]   We hear a lot.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.040]   Rarely.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.040]   Rarely.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   Anyway, just an idea.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.040]   We can kill a product, it says.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.640]   We can kill a product with their review or drive consumer adoption.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.320]   Yeah, that's bull crap.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.320]   Not anymore.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.560]   Used to be maybe one day we could do that.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.360]   Yeah, no, those days are over.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.360]   So, let's see.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.800]   Let's try to kill a product.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   How about Apple's wristwatch?
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   Yeah, let's try my best.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.880]   It was an interesting product.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.560]   So, Natalie, you're a fashion plate.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   You and Kate Spade.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   Thank you for saying that.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.560]   Like this.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.560]   Well, look at you.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   You're dressed to the nines.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.560]   You're gorgeous.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   You've got earrings on.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.360]   Well, I don't normally wear earrings.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.040]   You've got lovely lipstick, everything.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.240]   So, I'm just figuring you probably have all people.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.880]   See, I say, "Oh, I'm not going to wear a watch."
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.360]   And so, people say, "Well, you're a geek.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   You're not a good."
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.960]   So, look, we brought an actual woman onto the show.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.360]   An actual woman.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.600]   So, first of all, the Pebble.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.680]   Would you get a Pebble watch?
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   Would you wear that?
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.640]   I've worn a couple of these different types of iterations before there even was an iOS.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.240]   Samsung used to have one.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:18.200]   There used to be various ones that they vibrated on your wrist to let you know that your phone
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.600]   is ringing on your purse.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   That's kind of fun stuff.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:26.400]   But I am into this quantified self, the whole notion of the quantified self.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.480]   No, I agree with it.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   What is it?
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.640]   Well, it's like the Nike fuel band or the job on up.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.440]   Quantified self?
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   What does that mean?
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.080]   That's a neat notion that you keep information about your body.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.800]   Like you wear one of those sleep trackers and you wear a Fitbit and you keep all your
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.120]   calories and your iPad app and you have all this information and you've quantified yourself
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.120]   in order to do it.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.280]   Sounds more like the neurotic self.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.240]   Well, it is super neurotic, but it's also super addicting.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   It is addicting.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.240]   Absolutely.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.920]   That's why this stuff is taking off though.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   Who is it?
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.160]   There's somebody who's doing this like in a very serious way right now.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.240]   He's like got measurements of everything going on.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   I'm trying to remember.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   Tim Ferriss does.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.240]   Tim does this?
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.920]   In the most recent book he talks about how he has logs of every workout he's ever done
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.080]   for like 30 years.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:21.120]   And yeah, it seems kind of what's the right one on where it's self-involved, narcissistic,
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.880]   self-centered, solid, small, acidic kind of data.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.880]   Once you do a little bit of it, though, then you want to do it for everything.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.400]   It's really a slippery slope from stepping on the scale every day to then knowing your
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.680]   weight and your caloric intake and your heart rate and your resting heart rate.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.680]   So I think that's why I'm most interested in this Apple watch.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   They were saying at CES that this was the CES of Quantified Self and they did have a
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.520]   whole section at the Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:51.640]   But they only one did anything besides heart rate and steps.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.920]   And there was one that did oxygen, blood oxygen level.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.560]   I'm actually reviewing that for BYB.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   Oh yeah?
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.560]   But does it work?
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   That one isn't a wrist.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.560]   I don't have the wrist.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   Does it have to pierce your fingers?
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   No.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.560]   No.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.240]   I don't have the wrist model.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.440]   You actually walk up to it and put your thumb on it.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.160]   And it can take blood oxygen level.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.800]   And you do that like once or twice a day.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.200]   And when you find the number to be off standard and you do what?
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.200]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   That's breathe more.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   You take a walk.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.760]   You eat an apple.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.560]   And once you take it one day, it seems like you kind of have that information.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.000]   You don't really need it once a day.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.600]   Well, yeah, you do if it fluctuates.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.200]   I mean, I guess mine doesn't fluctuate enough for me to feel like I need it.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   There's enough information.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.640]   It's not that we don't want the information.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.680]   But what if you knew all of this stuff?
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.520]   There's a new diet program, for instance, you take a cheek swab, they look at it's like
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.320]   23 and me, but they look at only at the alleles for weight.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.800]   And then they prescribe a physical diet regimen.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.440]   They send you food based on the alleles you have.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.440]   That's stupid.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.040]   It's just all about getting more.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.760]   I mean, all of these things.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.440]   I was thinking of doing it.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.080]   All these things are getting more precise about the things we do.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.280]   There's lots of things that we do and we're not sure what the impact is.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:11.480]   So the Fitbit thing, the thing is, is once you do a little bit of this, then you start
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.840]   to want more of it.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.240]   I'd like to take my Fitbit.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.960]   Like when I go to the gym, I wish it was an ecosystem.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.160]   Like my Fitbit could talk to each of the machines that you're on and sort of take the
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.360]   data of like, okay, I did that machine.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.560]   I did this one.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.040]   My workout on that one was this.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.040]   And then it could suck all that data in.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.040]   Right?
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.720]   And then you could compare and look at, okay, when I was working on these machines, you
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.320]   know, this was working versus that.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.920]   And so the thing is, we actually don't have enough data.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.360]   We have more data than we had in the past when you track your activity.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.880]   But in the same sense, once you start looking at some of it, then you're like, well, okay,
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.680]   I need a lot more to actually make an accurate measurement.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:55.080]   And so the way Apple could come in and be, I think, a player in this, and that's where
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.760]   I hope they're going with this watch thing, not kind of what Pebble is doing.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:03.960]   But I have to actually, like Natalie, I'm hoping that it's more of a fitness or activity
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.280]   tracker and that it creates an ecosystem, right?
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:14.200]   Where the same way the iPod and iPhone has where, you know, you can then connect to whatever
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.480]   their ecosystem is.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.600]   Unfortunately, it'll be, you know, a closed Apple ecosystem, but maybe it'll be a start
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:24.680]   and there'll be others as well of, you know, ecosystems of activity where these things
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:29.720]   through Bluetooth or whatever, then can connect to and give you more data, you know, for instance,
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.760]   in a gym and with gym machines and that kind of stuff.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.120]   And Google tried to do this with Google Health, but that's since been closed down.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.960]   But I think what you're trying to get at here is the term for it.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.080]   I think we can call this an issue of standardization because the data exists in various kind of
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:50.560]   platforms like I wear a polar at the gym, which is a heart rate monitor, which does
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.960]   talk to the treadmill, but then I have to go and actually physically connect that to
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.160]   my computer and it doesn't go into lose it, which I like to use to track my weight and
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.440]   it doesn't, you know, talk to Fitbit.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.440]   And so my husband Clayton is talking to a doctor recently and he said, if there was
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:11.240]   someone, could be private enterprise that came along and enabled us to access that data
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.040]   of the quantified self.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.920]   And then as a physician, you could treat someone so much better, but now, you know, physicians
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.640]   have their own software and consumers have, you know, the quantified self software and
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.600]   mostly that's for fun.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.960]   But if that could stop being for fun and stop being used in the medical community, then
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.120]   we've got gold.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.360]   Is Apple capable of that?
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.360]   I don't know.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.720]   Google gave up a long time ago, but, you know, Microsoft did too.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.280]   Yeah, Microsoft did too.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   I forgot about that.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.920]   You said that you both use an interesting word though, addictive.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.600]   And if my if Apple is going to do something, I think that's something they're looking
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.560]   at that it's what you want, isn't it?
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:51.720]   You want something that's whether good or bad, so compelling that people can't stop doing
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.440]   it once they start getting these measurements.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.680]   I hadn't really thought of the eye watches being a biometric device, but I think you might
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   be onto something.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.000]   But even if it's not, you can create an app for us to make it that.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.440]   I can look at that, pulling my phone out of my pocket every 30.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.400]   So that's what everybody assumed the eye watch was was something that ties to your phone,
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.200]   tells you text, and that's what the pebble does, tells you text messages, alarms and stuff
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.680]   like that.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.080]   But that's not as compelling as it is, something that goes a little farther.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.080]   No, I agree.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.440]   I mean, I have a fuel band and I use it and it's pretty basic in terms of the information
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.760]   that it actually gives you, right?
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.480]   And there's always questions about its accuracy.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:32.640]   But I also, I don't know if I see Apple being the kind of company that's going to bring
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   all of this.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   Well, they have the Nike.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.040]   They really want to get involved in your medical.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.080]   They did the Nike thing early on, didn't they?
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.080]   The Nike.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.080]   iPod thing.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.160]   The Nike Plus integration with the iPod.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.320]   To date, really the most successful, I think the most successful biometric.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.320]   It's the same stuff that the fuel band uses as well.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.320]   Yeah, it's motion X.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.560]   Bluetooth to connect to the iPods and stuff.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.680]   And RunKeeper, which has been around for a long time, anybody who's a runner probably
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.400]   knows about the RunKeeper app and the KeepTrack here runs.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.400]   They've created a larger database system to keep track of everything.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.280]   I think there is a move towards making an API for all this so that these devices can
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.040]   write to some central.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.560]   Then there's the privacy issue, which you talked about last week.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.320]   And I think that's probably why Google closed Google Health is because people were too nervous
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.320]   about giving that.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.320]   There's a bunch of laws about this.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.320]   There's HIPAA and other stuff.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.360]   And I think people were nervous about telling Google stuff.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:31.000]   So I remember seeing you at Comdex around 2000 or something or CES.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.400]   And you had one of those devices on you that told you how far you walked.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   Was that you?
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   Yeah, pedometer.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.480]   Scott Wilkinson wears those 20 miles in three days.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.480]   Big deal.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   But you know, the new thing is--
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.480]   You can't even clean my office.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.600]   The new thing is, well, I can understand that.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.480]   The new thing is walk 10,000 steps a day.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   And that's the new thing.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.280]   I know one of these crazy devices I have behind me, then you get one of these track
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.280]   desks.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.280]   And you beat me on it.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.280]   Clayton has built it.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.120]   She combined this with a really old idea of drinking eight of those jugs of water.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.120]   Eight jugs of water.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.120]   You'll get the 10,000 steps in one bathroom.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.680]   You got it.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.720]   Clayton has built a table, which you can see if you're watching the video behind Natalie.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.280]   But his high, and the reason is he's going to slide a treadmill under there.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.520]   And then he's going to walk while he works.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.520]   That's the plan.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.720]   Are you going to do that, Natalie?
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.480]   You know, I'm a full foot shorter than he is.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.600]   So if I wanted to use his track desk, then that would be a problem.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.840]   I would have to be like my favorite.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.680]   You have your chin would be on the top.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.240]   No, I like the idea of it.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   I'm not skeptical.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.440]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:42.480]   But you know, I just I always freak out when something humongously, you know, unsightly like
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   this shows up.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.520]   Ah, the word that finally came out humongous.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   No, unsightly.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   It is a little.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.040]   Yeah, she's been waiting to get that one in.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.200]   Oh, Clayton, that's unsightly.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.200]   How about this?
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.240]   The limbic intelligent chair.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:00.600]   It's in German, but it's so revolution, the sits in.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   Revolution, the sits in.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.040]   What is it?
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.640]   Some revolutions, a revolutionary chair.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.800]   It looks like a tortured device.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.480]   Go to the English and see revolutionizing seating.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:20.840]   This apparently does keeps you moving.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.880]   It has a positive, it's a limbic chair.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.880]   I don't know.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.880]   It looks dangerous.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.560]   You know, I read an article in Yoga Journal years ago about how this thing is horrible.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.840]   It's really so bad for us, but it's better to move when you're sitting than we sit when
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.400]   you're sitting, obviously.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.640]   That's why I sit on a ball.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   But this one looks like you're supposed to-
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.080]   You want to sit on a ball for- well, never mind.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.680]   I sit on a ball.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:49.120]   Well, are you going to make some sort of live strong joke here?
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.880]   I'm trying to figure out where you're going with it.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.080]   No, and that's a good reference.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.080]   It's very funny.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.080]   Thank you.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.480]   I got it.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:01.840]   So, Apple, you know, the first the rumor came out was the New York Times, and then the Wall
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.160]   Street Journal picked it up kind of like, "Yeah, yeah, we knew that."
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.640]   But then Bloomberg really got the story with, they said, "No, there's two."
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   They had two named two executives.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.320]   They said, "The 100-man team on this eye watch, so we have to put aside, put to bed the notion
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.080]   that this is just a prototype and that maybe Apple's actually doing it."
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.520]   Yeah, they're going big.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.520]   They're going big.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:23.000]   And I love this analyst who says that they need this to fill the gaping hole in the Apple
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   ecosystem.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   I haven't been staring at a gaping hole like that.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   That's a key.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.480]   The TV would fill that gaping hole.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.880]   Yeah, no, I agree with that.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.360]   And Steve said, apparently, that he wanted to do a car, too.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.760]   Ooh, that would be cool.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   Steve Jobs' car.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.360]   They put the pedal on the left, just to make it, you know, different pedal on the left.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.360]   It's like changing your right in the middle.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.080]   You can't drive through the drive-through, because he didn't believe in fast food.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.120]   No, no fast food's allowed.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.040]   That's what the eye watch is going to do.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.960]   Somebody in the chat room said, "The eye watch should just shout at you.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.680]   Hey, Fatso, stay away from that burger."
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.520]   I don't think so.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.520]   All right.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.520]   The one pedal Apple car.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.520]   Exactly.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:09.720]   It's a brake and an accelerator and a clutch, all in one.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   Brake.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.720]   Accelerating it wrong.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   Clutch.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   All in one.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.720]   Brake.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   Accelerator.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.720]   Clutch.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.720]   All in one.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.720]   You're getting the idea, John.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.920]   I'm all over it.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.640]   Nice bug in the iOS 6.1.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.280]   You like that?
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.320]   They broke it.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.080]   This was something in iOS 4 that you could get through.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.320]   I don't have an iPhone in front of me.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.320]   Do you have an iPhone?
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.280]   If you haven't, you have it on 6.1.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   Turn on the lock.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   Let's see if we can open it up.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   Oh, there's that crazy idea.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   You're making an emergency call.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.360]   You press a few buttons and now you've got the access to the phone.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   Nice.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   They're going to fix it.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.840]   No, you don't have to give me your phones before Irina.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.000]   She made me a hat though.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Yes, she did.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.640]   Yeah, so I'm not going to break into your phone.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.640]   Because I...
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.680]   You look like Meg on Family Guy.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   [laughter]
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:02.800]   Irina just said, "He does!"
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.720]   That means I'm going to wear it even more.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.200]   Apple lowers the price on its MacBook Pro with Retina.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.960]   $200 and bumps the speed of its other Retina machines.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.600]   And this is why I was looking at a Haswell Ryan because I was thinking, "I'm going to
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   wait because I want to get a Haswell MacBook Pro or MacBook Air."
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.600]   Right?
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.800]   I mean, there's different mindset.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.360]   Yeah, you can always...
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.840]   The problem with buying PCs is you can always wait and there's always going to be something
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.840]   for them.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.840]   It's going to rise in it.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:38.240]   I believe that really, if I could wait six months, I'll be happier to get a Haswell-based
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.360]   MacBook Air with more battery life.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.600]   It's always going to feel better when you're buying on the beginning of that curve.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   Exactly.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.520]   Your product is going to be around longer.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.560]   But I don't think anybody that buys an Ivy Bridge MacBook Pro today is going to somehow
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.360]   fall behind the curve in six months either.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.360]   Okay.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.360]   All right.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.360]   Let's see.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:05.720]   I'm just as long as we've got Apple in the news, let's go through a few more Apple stores.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:11.640]   Tim Cook was speaking at the Goldman Sachs Conference and was talking a little bit about
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.240]   the Apple stores.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:20.240]   120 million people, last quarter alone visiting Apple stores.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.760]   The rate of growth is astronomical.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.240]   More visitors versus the stores open the 20 of the stores.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.360]   They're closing, moving them, making them bigger.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:38.840]   In addition, adding 30 more stores, 13 countries, the average number of visitors per store going
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   up dramatically.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   Just the Apple store.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   Huge success.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   Huge success.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.000]   Why Microsoft's following suit wisely, I might add.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.280]   Look at the graph here.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:53.000]   This is average retail profit per employee and visitor.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   It's getting too detailed here.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.480]   That explains why I can never get a genius appointment more than three days out.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.480]   It's crazy.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.480]   They're jammed.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.400]   This gets lost too much when we take about the success of Apple over the past five years,
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.960]   10 years.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:16.200]   The stores, it's such a opposite trend.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.960]   So much of retail is struggling.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.840]   So much of tech retail is really struggling.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.800]   At the same time, Apple opens these stores and all of a sudden now, not only is it making
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:32.200]   so much more money on products when it sells them itself through these stores, but it
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:37.560]   uses it as a way to just get products to the market and control the user experience and
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:41.560]   make more money than anybody else in retail right now.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   It's insane.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.040]   It's completely counterintuitive.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:48.520]   It was a big risk when they started doing it and it's one of the main things that has
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.120]   driven their success.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.280]   And like Johnson, it's actually smart that somebody like Microsoft, why wouldn't you
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.280]   do it?
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.280]   Samsung should be doing it too.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   They are.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.280]   Samsung is.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   And they are.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.280]   Actually, they are.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   They look just like the Microsoft stores, which look just like the Apple.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.320]   This is like that movie that forgot who was in it.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:09.200]   The guy who played the original Batman, not the board, but the movie.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.480]   Michael Keaton played the guy who was cloning himself.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.640]   And it just started to deteriorate after generational clones.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.880]   And these guys are idiots.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.440]   And this was going to happen with these stores.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.240]   There's going to be some crazy stores from, you know, I won't name a company, but the
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   transcription errors.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   Yeah, multiplicity.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   multiplicity.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.000]   So total top 10 retailer sales per square foot in 2012.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.840]   Apple so far and away above the rest, more than $6,000 per square foot.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:38.840]   Tiffany.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:39.840]   Amazing.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.840]   Half that.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.840]   Tiffany.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.840]   And that's the always the leader.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.600]   No, number three, Lulu Lemon, half of Tiffany, coach about the same size as Lulu
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.560]   Lemon, Michael Cores, select comfort.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.160]   People buy a lot of beds.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.160]   Mattresses.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.840]   How many mattresses do people need?
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   I don't know.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.240]   But boy, when you buy a mattress, you know how it's expensive.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.480]   What is true?
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.480]   True religion.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   What do they sell?
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   Religion.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.480]   Genes.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.480]   Oh, of course they don't really.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   I had never knew that.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   Well, I never knew that.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.920]   Occasionally we'll have a woman on and we'll ask them questions like that.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.920]   Sometimes the women are useful in this regard.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   Stop it.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   Oh, sometimes.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.560]   Oh, see, you opened the can of whoop ass.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.920]   The chat rooms bring it up.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.720]   How long till Google starts opening stores?
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.600]   Is that just one of our stories?
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.600]   It is.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   Google is opening stores.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   And that's the segue.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.600]   Yes.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.200]   Well, that's a good segue because this is news to me.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.560]   It was announced this week.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:40.720]   Google stores are rumored to get to open retail stores to let your greasy mitts on
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.520]   things like Google phones and access, Google Glass.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.920]   They've already been, you see this in airports.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.560]   In fact, I think that pictures are in an airport.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.680]   You already see these all the time for selling Chromebooks or maybe, I don't know if they're
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.960]   selling them or just offering them for demo.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.000]   This is an urgent Atlantic partnership where that was terminal to it.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   SFO.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   Where you give, if you're on a Virgin flight, you can take a Chromebook.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.120]   Yeah, they're not selling it, but it certainly has that impact.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.080]   And you give it back to them on the other end.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:13.680]   But in the segue that the iPad was one of those products that you couldn't necessarily
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.480]   get on board with, I think until you got it in your hands.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.040]   And that's one of the Apple stores was one of the main things that drove that.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.880]   They could be the same could be true with Chromebooks.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:27.360]   I mean, people that I know that are using them, normal people, not like people on this
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.320]   call, actually like them.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:35.840]   I mean, it doesn't really do enough for me yet to get that interested in it.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.800]   But most of the people that once they get their hands on it, they actually say, you
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.680]   know what, there are some things I can't do and I wish I could edit photos better or
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.520]   do that.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.040]   For most of the stuff I do, it's defined as a second piece.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.400]   You're talking about a Chromebook.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   A Chromebook.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   Yes, a Chromebook.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.400]   Well, let's face reality.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   It's useless.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.400]   Apparently not.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   Some people think it's not.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.000]   Like you just said himself, you know, I wish I could edit photos better.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.440]   In other words, it's just kind of a half baked machine.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.040]   It does the things kind of moderate.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.280]   You know, you'll do a little word processing, take some notes.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.600]   You're on an airplane, you could doze off, take it, put a note in there and save it.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.080]   Or if you can even save it, there's no way to save stuff.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.840]   Yeah, you save it to the cloud.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:12.840]   What are you getting now?
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.440]   Oh, the cloud, I forgot about that.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:21.200]   I wonder if maybe these, I would like to hope that these, if they go into the whole retail
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:25.000]   outlets thing, that they do kind of what they've done with their Google Experience Center,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.960]   that they did in Kansas City where the fiber is.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   Exactly.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:31.240]   Well, they're not just showing you a tablet and a phone because that sounds kind of boring,
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.720]   but they're showing you all these cool ideas that you can maybe do with their technology.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:39.280]   You know, obviously in Kansas City, they're showing here's all the cool stuff we can do
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.880]   when, you know, ubiquitous gigabit internet is a reality.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.080]   And I think that's really would get people interested that they would, you know, make
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:52.000]   a date, so to speak, to go out there and see these types of, these types of demonstrations
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   and examples and setups.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.400]   Well, somebody, here's what you can't do.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:59.960]   You can't be a store for Android devices because there's so many Android devices that
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.560]   it would look like a Sephora store.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   Exactly.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.560]   You would want it.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.640]   And yeah, you know, I'll just go Google and Nexus phone would be in this store.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.000]   Well, they're Google products, but not all the other ones.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Let's go.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.680]   I think you were doing friends to their own to their own products, right?
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.680]   Sure.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   Because then they're cannibalizing their own.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.840]   Oh, sure they can.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:19.840]   Let's sure.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.680]   Let's bring go back to the Chromebook.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.440]   Okay, so that it is cheap.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.440]   That's for sure.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.000]   It's very cheap and, you know, I use this, whatever.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.600]   Why does a analogy of the Sephora store was completely lost on the chat room?
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.200]   I've been to a Sephora store.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.480]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.600]   It's a giant makeup arena.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.800]   Yes, for makeup.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   For makeup.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:45.400]   Yeah, well, a lot of the chat room guys go there for obvious reasons, but not all of
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   them.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.400]   It's just a lot of them.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.400]   I lip gloss nail.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.400]   There we go.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   Watch.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.640]   I did an image search on Sephora.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.200]   So let me go back to this point.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.880]   Why doesn't Google do us all a favor and take their Chrome technology and all the rest
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.680]   of it and get us a new operating system to replace Windows?
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   What Chrome is supposed to be?
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   Chrome is probably a Chrome.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.560]   No, but I want a real one that runs a desktop kick-ass desktop.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.140]   But you're the only one left that wants a desktop bull crap.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.840]   No, that's a desktop's are dead.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.840]   Aren't they?
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.680]   I'm trying running for Google.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.680]   By the way, Trevor.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.920]   In his Illustrator and one of these.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.720]   Seth Winetrap from 905 Google who got this scoop.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.360]   He says from an extremely reliable source.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:30.200]   And if you scroll down a little bit, he says, the decision I'm told to open stores is mostly
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:34.000]   about Google Glass because they feel it's going to be hard to get people interested in
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.600]   the idea of wearing these glasses unless they try them.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:40.200]   I run into a lot of people that say they want these badly.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   Geeks want them.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   I can understand that.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.880]   That's a hard drive in the driverless car.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.240]   I think it's about test drives in the driverless car.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.240]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.240]   Maybe the store isn't a store.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:52.240]   Maybe it's a maybe it's actually a van that drives itself.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.160]   It comes to your house.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.200]   Hey, just get in and shut up.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.760]   Like the Google van's here.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.760]   The Google van's here.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.760]   There's no humans involved.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:03.480]   Like the the ice cream man, right?
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.480]   The Google man.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   Oh, the Google man.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.280]   It could be an Eric Schmidt doll.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.280]   Hello.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.360]   It sounds like a horror movie.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.360]   It does.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:19.960]   Actually, I think if I'm not mistaken, there is a video of Eric Schmidt.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.640]   Isn't there driving an ice cream?
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.600]   Yeah, there was a car.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   Was it a cartoon truck?
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.760]   Yeah, it was it was like to maybe that's why that's in my brain.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   Was it?
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.160]   It's one of those Japanese recreations.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.680]   It's the evil ice cream man.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.680]   Like an anime.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.880]   Yeah, it's kind of anime looking thing.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.880]   I think I might have it.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.080]   Yes, this is getting weird.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.600]   The show is off the rails.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.360]   Oh, it's been off the rails since 19 and 22, I think.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.280]   Here is the this this has to do with him.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.280]   This was a Times Square ad.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.280]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.280]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.480]   Yeah, this is creepy.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:55.980]   Oh.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.080]   That's the Google van.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.240]   This is so disturbing, yeah.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.160]   It's coming to your house.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.440]   Text evil to 69866.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.120]   Wow.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.680]   That must be from Microsoft.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.200]   That's like the scruggled ads.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:08.560]   Text--
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.520]   Was it from privacy?
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.360]   I thought it was from privacy.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.000]   Yeah, and I think they were heavily funded by Microsoft.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   Of course.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.840]   Ah, ah, yeah.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.400]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.280]   Come back with more.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.640]   Before we get to the commercial, I
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.840]   wouldn't mind seeing what's coming up on the week ahead.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.800]   And then we were going to segue from that
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.600]   into a discussion at the PlayStation 4.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.320]   Tom Merritt has the latest.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.440]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.800]   Here's a few of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.520]   ahead on Tech News today.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.640]   Of course, no show Monday, February 18.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.800]   It's President's Day.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.920]   Tuesday, February 19.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.440]   It's the San Francisco Music Tech Summit.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.760]   Also, Dell has their earnings call.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.440]   And HTC has their big press conference.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.880]   Wednesday, February 20.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.440]   Sony asks us to see the future of PlayStation
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.040]   with their press conference in the afternoon.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.440]   Thursday, February 21.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.320]   HP has their earnings call.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.080]   And the Legend of Zelda celebrates a birthday.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.160]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.400]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.280]   That was a very weak week, except for that PS4.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.040]   We'll talk Ryan.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.640]   And I think Ryan knows a little bit about what the PS4 is
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.200]   going to contain.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.320]   Is it new hardware or not?
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.080]   It's kind of unclear.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.320]   And we will probably-- I'm guessing--
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.320]   cover that announcement live right after triangulation
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.840]   on Wednesday, so you can watch live coverage of the PlayStation
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.440]   4 announcement.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.120]   Maybe Ryan, you'd like to come back before Twitch
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.000]   and join us and talk a little bit about that.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.840]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at audible.com,
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.560]   the greatest bookstore in the world.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.000]   If you like audiobooks, there is none better.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.560]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.760]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you can get two books for free.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.440]   Look, this is kind of timely.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.600]   Stephen Levy's in the plex, how Google thinks,
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.240]   works, shapes our lives.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.360]   They've got a lot of technology books,
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.560]   but they also have fiction as well.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.120]   A lot of great literature.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:58.880]   History too.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:59.880]   I read a lot of biographies.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.960]   Here's a new one.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.640]   I can't wait.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.160]   Boy, this is going to be dynamic.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.800]   The Calvin Coolidge biographies is now out.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.160]   21 hours of Calvin Coolidge.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.520]   You hardly knew him.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.200]   Actually, I loved and highly recommend
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.160]   the John Adams biography, which I did read by David Attenborough.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:19.920]   Is it David Attenborough?
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.160]   No, who wrote that?
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.200]   Anyway, wonderful book.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:23.800]   Here's the deal.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.880]   If you visit audible.com/twit2,
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.360]   you're going to sign up for the platinum plan.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.760]   That's two books a month.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.840]   But your first month is free.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.400]   So that means your first two books are free.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.080]   You can cancel it before the month's up and pay nothing,
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.600]   but keep those books forever.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.120]   I'm going to look up this.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.320]   David McCullough, that's who it is.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:42.880]   Not Attenborough.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.120]   David McCullough wrote that.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.400]   And he narrates the--
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:45.880]   He's great.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.440]   Oh, I love it.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.760]   He narrates the unabridged, but I mean the abridged,
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.760]   but I would get the unabridged, because it is such a great story.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:58.240]   The revitalized the reputation of John Adams, who was kind of--
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240]   And we're Herman too.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.560]   I think reads the unabridged.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.160]   Which is really great reading.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.440]   I love him.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.760]   Edward Herman does a lot of--
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.040]   You recognize him.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:07.880]   He's a character actor.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.240]   He does a lot of--
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.520]   --was in a lot of movies.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.600]   But now I think he's mostly doing audiobooks.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.880]   He's done a lot of the audiobooks from audible.com.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.080]   Actually, I take that back.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.360]   It looks like Edward Herman reads the abridged.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.600]   And Nelson Ranger reads the unabridged--
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.440]   He's awesome too.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440]   He's awesome too.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:25.940]   Yeah.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.120]   Herman did Einstein, which was a great biography.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.840]   Thomas Jefferson, also a great biography.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.440]   And oh, and I did listen to this.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.920]   This is David McCullough's most recent book, The Greater
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.400]   Journey-- Americans of Paris.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.480]   Edward Herman narrated that.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.160]   I loved that.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.520]   That was a great story about how Americans in the 19th century
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.360]   all went to Paris.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.320]   That was the place to go.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.800]   If you were a physician, it was the best medical schools.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.440]   If you were an artist, if you were a writer,
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.000]   you had to go to Paris in the 19th century.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.760]   Really great stuff.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.720]   Well, you could see there's just a ton of great books.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.240]   So pick a couple, go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.360]   I recommend the Audible apps on your iPhone, your Android
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.880]   phone, your Windows phone.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.200]   They really help you can manage your library.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   All your books are available.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.120]   You can download them at any time.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.080]   Just fantastic.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:16.440]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.040]   And enjoy your Audible experience.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.360]   We think you will.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.880]   So Wednesday afternoon--
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.320]   I think it's in the evening, east coast.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.520]   It's in New York City.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.520]   Are you going to go up for that, Ryan?
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.200]   No.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:30.680]   No.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.160]   Sony invited me, but I just--
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.480]   I don't know if I want to take a day and go there and all
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.760]   of that.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.440]   What do we expect for the PlayStation 4?
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.160]   I got the impression-- apparently, I misread the
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.640]   Engadget Post on this, as others did, that it wasn't going
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.920]   to be a very big deal.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.520]   But you say probably an AMD chip in this.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.480]   Yeah, I mean, it's definitely going to be an AMD chip.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.360]   And I know that for a couple of reasons.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.160]   One is AMD has been heavily promoting a campaign.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.960]   They're a four-pronged attack in one of them is consoles.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.280]   And they say--
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.320]   they said this at CES at one of their press conferences
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.040]   that we are in next generation consoles.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.040]   And they're basically coming out and saying that they're
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.080]   going to be the chip inside the new Xbox, the PlayStation.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.640]   They're already inside the Wii U. I've also just been talking
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.040]   to a lot of people in the industry know that they are
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:20.840]   in there.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.560]   And then it was actually in late January, rumors came out,
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.640]   information came out, leaked out about the developers'
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.600]   systems for the new PlayStation.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.160]   And we posted it on PC Per on the 23rd of January.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:40.720]   And it was an 8-core AMD bulldozer processor, 8 gigs
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.240]   of system memory, and an AMD, what they called an R1000-based
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.720]   GPU, which is essentially what we know today
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.920]   has the HD7000 series for gaming PC.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.440]   So it's pretty obvious that it's going to be an AMD part,
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:02.680]   both x86 for the processor and more traditional GPU design
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.600]   than what you have in the Sony PlayStation 3.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.160]   I think the cell is gone, for sure.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.760]   AMD owns ATI, so ATI graphics?
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.320]   ATI graphics, the same thing as AMD, Radeon graphics,
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.000]   and that kind of stuff.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.240]   So what's interesting about that is you're going to have--
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.680]   there's some debate on whether or not it's
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.000]   going to be an APU, which is a single piece of silicon
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.720]   that combines CPU and GPU into single chip,
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.200]   or if it's going to be a discrete processor
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.920]   and a discrete graphics chip separated there.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.080]   I kind of lean towards having them separate
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.960]   because it allows them a little bit more flexibility
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.520]   on the manufacturing side.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.360]   And they'll probably be able to get higher performance stuff
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.320]   out of kind of separating those two components.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.240]   But if that happens, you'll see the new PlayStation,
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.960]   the new Xbox, the Wii U, and PCs all basically using
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.840]   the same fundamental architecture.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.040]   And I think-- Wow.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.160]   You always hear a lot on gaming where it costs so much
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.840]   to make games because you have to do all this work for asset
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.200]   creation and that kind of thing.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.480]   And then you always have to worry about,
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.680]   is it a port to a PC?
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.520]   Is it a PC game with a port to a console?
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.760]   And that would kind of be out of the discussion
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.280]   at that point.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.080]   Would it be easy to take a PC game and make it
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.360]   work on those platforms?
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.200]   Interesting.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.480]   Assuming that Sony continues to use a Linux-based operating
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.400]   system, you know, you're using essentially Open GL.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.360]   The Xbox is using basically DirectX.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.840]   And the PC can run both of those.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.720]   And I think it makes it interesting.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.320]   If you have the same architecture across all those platforms,
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.080]   one, how do these companies start
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.400]   to differentiate themselves?
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.560]   How does Sony differentiate from Microsoft,
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.240]   differentiate from the PC, and then what
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.120]   are these software developers going to be able to do?
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.880]   I think it's great news for PC gaming as well.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.400]   Because they've-- over the last five years,
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.720]   they've kind of fallen off, right?
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.560]   Everybody develops for the high dollar income
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.760]   you get on the Xbox and the PlayStation.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.680]   And now, OK, we'll throw some money
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.520]   and we'll make a port for the PC.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.360]   Whereas here, if you develop for one,
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.400]   you can start with the super high-end assets
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.520]   and compute requirements.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.800]   And then just scale that exact same code down
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.760]   to run on whatever consoles we're at.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.600]   And meanwhile, it'll still run great on PCs, probably better.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.360]   Probably a much needed move since no company can develop--
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.280]   well, some do, but it's hard to develop for all the platforms
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.360]   out there.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:25.800]   It is.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.960]   And it's really fallen on game engines.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.320]   So if you look at the Unreal Engine, right, that was one.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   Right.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.720]   It's cross-platform.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.920]   The reason it's so popular is because of how well they
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.760]   built the cross-platform compatibility into it.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.440]   There's a lot of other interesting things
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.640]   that could happen at the PlayStation.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.720]   I'm still not 100% convinced that they're
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.080]   going to announce the hardware.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.440]   It might not be a PS4.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:45.960]   Wednesday.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.360]   They haven't said PS4 specifically.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.960]   No, I think it'll be more of a software
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.040]   and infrastructure announcement that maybe gets started
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:54.840]   at the end of the--
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.920]   And then they'll wait till E3, till June?
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.520]   Yeah, it just seems really early.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.320]   Unless they're going to surprise everybody
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.280]   announce that it's going to be available in the middle of the year.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.760]   But if they're still targeting a holiday, 2013,
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.280]   it just seems--
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.240]   I don't know.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.400]   You're giving yourself--
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.240]   you're giving your competition too much of a window
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.600]   to figure out and change whatever they want to change
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.480]   to make themselves look that much better.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.440]   And in product announcements, the reason
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.520]   you hold back as long as possible is because you don't want
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.800]   your competition to have time to react and change
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.880]   their strategy.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.800]   So don't announce the product unless it's available
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.960]   or soon to be available.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.760]   Yeah, announcing something in February that's not
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.920]   going to be available until October or November--
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.800]   Makes sense, yeah.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.760]   Doesn't make any sense.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.120]   That's why I think it'll be more of maybe a software
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.600]   and a philosophy type announcement
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.520]   that they're going to discuss--
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.520]   Well, it didn't fly out.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.080]   That sounds boring.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.440]   We've heard about a game controller that has touched,
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:51.200]   like the Wii U, is that possible?
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.280]   Yeah, I saw that the rumors of the--
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.640]   with a little kind of skinny screen across the middle.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.760]   A lot of negative--
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.640]   That's because it's easier to Photoshop that
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.120]   than a fat screen across the middle.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.040]   Yes, exactly.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.020]   I don't know.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:04.560]   It could be interesting.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.040]   You're talking about a--
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.720]   I kind of like the idea of maybe a small display that
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.080]   was maybe also a touch screen.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.040]   I don't know if anybody remembers the Dreamcast--
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.040]   Love the Dreamcast.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:16.880]   --it was now a long time ago.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.600]   And had these little modules that went in the controller.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.400]   And it was really basic looking display.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.400]   But you could do cool things like pick a play in Madden
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.600]   or draw a card or whatever.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.120]   And your opponent didn't have to see it.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.960]   Even if you're playing it on the same TV.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.560]   And I think that would be useful if not particularly
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.160]   necessary.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.360]   And what about compatibility with PS3 games?
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.400]   If they're using an x86 architecture,
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.320]   emulating a cell architecture is going to be almost impossible.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.000]   Because it's Big Endian, Little Endian.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.920]   They said they might be able to stream, kind of like on live,
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.200]   did.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.840]   Stream PS3 games.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:02.000]   They acquired a company called Guy Kai, about six to eight
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.640]   months ago, I guess, maybe six months ago,
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.760]   that does streaming games.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.920]   Guy Kai is a company that made the stuff, developed the
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:14.840]   technologies in Samsung TVs to do some game streaming.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.600]   On par, if not better than what On Live does.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.920]   And Sony acquired them.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.920]   And so everybody automatically assumed that some people
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.880]   assumed, well, the PlayStation 4 is just going to be a dummy
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.760]   console.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.560]   And you're going to stream your games.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.240]   That's not going to be the case.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.880]   But some sort of compatibility is needed, right?
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.720]   Well, it used to be, when PlayStation 3 first launched, it
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.360]   had backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 types.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:40.840]   Remember that.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.800]   Later, PlayStation 3s did not have that.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.400]   They actually took that feature away.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.080]   And it didn't seem to cause too much of a pain.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.120]   I don't think that's really an expected feature at this point
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.920]   anymore, which is disappointing.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.640]   But I don't really think it's a necessary feature.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.720]   But if they can offer it, they say, hey, for $15 a month,
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.240]   you have access to your to our full PlayStation 3
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.360]   library streaming, then it's not ideal.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.440]   It's not perfect.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.360]   But it's good.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.320]   It's worth it.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.400]   An Xbox 720 in June.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.880]   Or next-day generation.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.400]   Next-generation--
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   Well, Microsoft, I think, even said, yeah, the next--
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.440]   well, maybe not.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.960]   But that's the impression I got.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.640]   The next-generation Xbox would be at the E3.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.120]   So E3 is in June.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:29.480]   Right.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.400]   So that would make sense.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.640]   I think that is where all of the big announcements are happening.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.200]   I'm planning on flying out to LA for E3 for the first time
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.320]   in seven or eight years, because I imagine there's
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.360]   going to be a lot of hardware discussion that goes on.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.960]   And people want to compare the implementations
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.840]   from Sony and Microsoft in that regard.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.920]   NVIDIA is going to talk about their shield gaming device
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.200]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.760]   So June will be particularly busy for gaming hardware.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.640]   Brian is the host of PC--
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.560]   or Twitch.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.560]   He does a PC per podcast, PCper.com,
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.760]   editor-in-chief of PCper, but also
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.680]   hosts this week in computer hardware
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.440]   our good buddy, Patrick Norton, on--
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.960]   When is Twitch on?
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.400]   It is on Thursdays at 9 p.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. Pacific.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:17.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.600]   I'm usually gone.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:24.440]   That's why Thursdays on the Twitch network.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.920]   All right.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.040]   That's shut up the rest of the panel.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.160]   No interest.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.280]   Is there a race to announce between the PS4
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.800]   and the next version of Xbox?
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.760]   That's the only thing I wonder is maybe there's a race
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.440]   to see who announces first.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.440]   It might be a little bit of a game of chicken,
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:48.120]   because it's one of those things of you don't want to announce
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.200]   pre-announced too early.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.080]   But at the same time, you do a lot of times
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.000]   want to announce before your competition
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.800]   to look like the first to the party.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.680]   And so I don't know.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.920]   Just throwing it out there.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:02.400]   I think maybe the problem is if there's so much news at E3,
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.160]   nobody really gets the time to focus on your particular product.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.120]   So it's kind of like we keep seeing earlier
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.560]   pre-announcements at CES.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.600]   Everybody wants to do something today before.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.640]   Now everybody wants to do something two days before,
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.200]   because they want all the attention on them.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.280]   The problem with the E3 schedule is typically
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:21.880]   that one day is the Sony press conference as at night,
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.320]   and then the next morning is the Microsoft press conference.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.160]   And that doesn't give the media enough time
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.800]   to maybe digest all the PlayStation news that they would have.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.560]   So that would be the only reason I would think they would want
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.200]   to go early.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.040]   I just think this is really early to be spilling out
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.920]   all the details about a next-gen console.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.960]   All right.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.120]   That's the story.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.560]   Morning, glory.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.000]   Moving on.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.280]   Other big stories.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.640]   You know there was a meteor in Russia.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.640]   I didn't know this.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:58.840]   Bill Gates does a Reddit ask me anything in which he announces
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:04.160]   that he would rather fight a horse-sized duck than 100
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.760]   duck-sized horses.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.120]   What?
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:07.680]   Easy.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.120]   That's it.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.800]   That's it.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.840]   I swear to God.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.000]   Is he actually writing this?
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:13.440]   Do you know?
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.680]   That's a common Reddit themed question.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.160]   Exactly.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.960]   If you're doing an AMA, you know you're
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.640]   going to be asked that ahead of time.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:27.120]   And actually he has some sense of humor.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.000]   He tweeted that.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.720]   He says, Bill Gates says, "Thanks for a great AMA Reddit."
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.000]   And then in the tweet, he puts the picture of that horrible picture
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:35.760]   of him--
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.080]   Moonie modeling.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.120]   Modeling on IBM PC.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.960]   And to caption it, still trying to delete this photo
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.640]   from the internet.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.960]   Any ideas?
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.680]   That shows a little sense of humor.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.520]   I think he's got somebody doing that for him.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:50.600]   I watched that in the mail.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.840]   I believe he has time for us.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.920]   And it was really interesting.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.240]   He said a lot of interesting stuff, I thought.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:56.960]   Yeah, he did.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.760]   He was very candid about it.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:01.040]   Why are you so surprised to Bill Gates
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:01.960]   as an interesting person?
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.920]   He's a smart guy.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.480]   Well, and when you're a CEO, you're not
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.560]   going to say a lot of stuff.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.760]   So when you're kind of--
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.160]   he talked a lot-- and this was all about promoting his--
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.920]   He's the chairman not the CEO.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.360]   But that's what I'm saying is now that he's not the CEO anymore.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.440]   But he's still the chairman so--
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.040]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.880]   I think he's a little more forthright than he used to be.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:18.720]   You can't--
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.720]   He was promoting his--
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.560]   He was promoting his vaccines for Africa.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.840]   Yeah, well, that's fine.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   He was on an 80-inch Windows 8 tablet.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.480]   He did say Windows 8 was a huge advance.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.280]   I'm sure he did.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.000]   He's what's he going to say?
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.400]   Well, when he said it, he said it in a really joking manner.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.320]   I think the question is, Windows 7 or Windows 8 question,
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.000]   and he said, 8, higher is always better.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   And then, of course, as--
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   Yeah, you have to be pretty high to buy that thing.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.120]   Right after that, yeah.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.000]   He also said he's tried all of Apple's products.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.680]   He's using a Surface Pro and an 80-inch Windows display.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.320]   In fact, there's a picture of him in front of the 80-inch Windows
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.760]   display.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.920]   His eyes must be going.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:00.880]   He says it's the same used by Steve Ballmer.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.360]   Oh, that's an endorsement.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.200]   As used-- you know what?
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.720]   You know what he said that I thought was interesting.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.600]   I bet you, Ryan, this is what you're talking about.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.800]   When they asked him if he had any regrets or there was anything
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.600]   that he wished he'd put out that didn't get put out,
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.400]   he said, win FS.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.080]   They filed--
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.960]   I remember getting briefed on that.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.000]   And the idea of a database-based storage system
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.560]   still sounds really compelling rather than just
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.400]   a simple file structure.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.480]   But it never came to be.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.560]   It still hasn't.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.560]   They wouldn't hire anyone from the pick group.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.000]   I mean, the pick operating system is what we're talking about.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.280]   Sorry, what do you mean by that?
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.640]   What do you mean a database-based file system versus the files
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.600]   versus just regular files?
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.120]   The cool thing was it was basically
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.800]   blowing up the whole idea of the hierarchy in the way files
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.960]   are organized in your system.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.320]   And it actually was pretty much ahead of its time.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.920]   It was the idea that your system, your data,
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.680]   would be organized by tags, essentially by the data
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.600]   that was actually in the files.
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.200]   And you would more use your system by searching for things
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.920]   rather than going and digging through folders and files.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:10.840]   It would be--
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.880]   the files would be associated with each other
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.920]   based on the data, the metadata that's in those files.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.200]   I'm ahead of its time.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.680]   I believe this head of its time actually appeared in the--
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.600]   I believe the late '60s when the pick operating system first
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.800]   appeared or the '70s.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.600]   So the Microsoft license is by this?
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.640]   No, they never even hired anybody.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.440]   Dick Pick is the guy that should have hired him.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.080]   I remember that.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.440]   And this has been done.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.480]   We could forget it.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.760]   But that's the way systems are now, right?
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.440]   It's databases have gone this flat.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.600]   We used to have these hierarchical databases
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.760]   that ran the internet.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.760]   But before long, it was too labor-intensive for the machines
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.520]   to run them.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.560]   Right now, they're all run on these flat, no-sequel databases
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.360]   they're called, right?
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.520]   And it's based just on this kind of thing.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.480]   So it wasn't ahead of its time.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.520]   Although, to be honest, it's one of those things that's sort of--
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.080]   I don't know.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.120]   It's sort of a given now, right?
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.360]   It's just stuff that's there.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.000]   I don't know how much of an effect it would have had on Windows.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.720]   And it sort of felt like a dodge to me that he picked WinFS.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.800]   I don't think he was going to say anything
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.480]   that he was really upset about because they may still do it,
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:17.840]   right?
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.400]   So I don't think--
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.720]   Microsoft Bob.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.320]   They'll never do it.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.120]   You won't mention Bob.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.640]   Bob's been taken out of the timeline
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.560]   and the micro-cell history.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.640]   It was such an embarrassment.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.480]   It's like the Edsel.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.200]   Gone.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.000]   Here's the video that he made answering ahead of time
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.800]   questions he knew they would be asking him on the Reddit AM.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.600]   [DING]
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.600]   Question one.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.600]   How much money is in your wallet?
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.400]   I don't always carry a wallet.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:53.000]   But I got one with me and it looks like I've got, well, $100.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.480]   Perfect.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.720]   Fascinating.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.160]   Can I have a million dollars?
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.600]   Question two.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.480]   Well, Melinda and I thought long and hard
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.800]   about where the money we're lucky enough to have--
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.960]   She's just said no.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.960]   It sounds like a robot.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.200]   --to invent new vaccines, things like malaria.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.200]   No, it sounds good.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.960]   And needs to invent new seeds for farmers who need to pay more.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:13.960]   He's plugging his.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.200]   So if you're a farmer, if your child's going up,
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.600]   who hasn't had access to the access--
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.040]   We'll give you money, but you know.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.960]   Most resources are for you.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.000]   But otherwise, we've already picked where all the money's
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   going to go.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   [DING]
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   Question three.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:28.520]   Question three.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.640]   Which would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.000]   or one horse-sized duck?
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.760]   Not sure about the specifics.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.760]   But in general, I like taking on big problems, things
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.520]   like new vaccines.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.360]   So I guess you could call that a horse-sized duck.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.040]   Feel free to ask me anything.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.680]   Monday, February 11th at 10 p.m.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.320]   He actually did a promotional video.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.480]   EST.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.960]   It should be a lot of fun.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.720]   Yeah, yeah, the thrill.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.080]   I was having a ball there.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.520]   I'd like to give that duck dip theory or whatever.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.040]   Hey, somebody in the chat room asked about Tim Cook being
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.120]   a no-show at the State of the Union.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:05.880]   You know about this, right?
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.840]   No, he was there.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.320]   He did.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.800]   They never showed him on the screen.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.240]   But he was there, I saw him.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:10.720]   You sure?
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.240]   Or maybe that was Ted Nugent.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.280]   It looked a lot alike.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.040]   Ted Nugent.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.880]   Ted Nugent was there.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:16.640]   Who was he doing there?
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.200]   They did mention in the--
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.200]   what was he-- I don't know.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.680]   Why was Ted Nugent at the--
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.720]   he was there.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.480]   I saw a picture.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.520]   He was in the gallery with all the presidents, men,
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.720]   and all that.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.120]   They mentioned Tim Cook because I didn't present Obama say,
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.120]   and Abil will be--
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:30.620]   Right.
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.160]   And then they--
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.760]   normally they throw the camera on the guy when he's talking about it.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.160]   Was it next to--
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.280]   No, he wasn't.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   There was some old lady on Michelle's right
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.480]   and looked like a woman from China.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.560]   Maybe he was in drag.
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.640]   Everybody in the chat says that they did show him.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.280]   I think they showed him, John.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.080]   Did you watch--
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.120]   I was watching it.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.080]   You know what was really cool?
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.880]   C-SPAN 2 had the Twitter feed of all the kibbutzing
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.200]   congressmen.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.240]   Oh, I bet that was fun.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.160]   It was actually quite humorous.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.720]   Maybe I was too busy reading the Twitter feed.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.800]   But I heard him say that Apple thing.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.720]   I didn't see Tim Cook.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.220]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.320]   He must have blinked.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.040]   I mean, it was quick.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.880]   John wasn't the only one who thought that of the chat room
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.320]   guy brought it up.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.680]   Huh.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:15.200]   Did they explain why Tim Ted Newshin was there?
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.800]   Actually, I'm curious.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.000]   Here's a picture.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.760]   Here's a picture that proves it from Business Insider--
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.720]   Not Photoshopped.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.440]   Not Photoshopped.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.920]   There he is, see?
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.720]   But he's right behind Michelle Obama.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.280]   But you're right.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.600]   There's the Chinese lady next to her.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.760]   So I guess she wouldn't pride a place.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.960]   There he is right there.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.200]   That's nice.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:38.720]   Wait, what was it?
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.560]   And they stay through the camera on him
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.480]   when they mention Apple?
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   It's the state of the union, yeah.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:42.920]   That was-- it was.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:42.920]   It was.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.160]   It was taken with the Emmys.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.400]   That was the Emmys?
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.400]   Oh, never mind.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:46.880]   I'm kidding.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.960]   I'm kidding.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.080]   No, that's Chinese woman.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.440]   I've only seen her once, and that was at this time.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.120]   And proves it.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.440]   And by the way, she clapped like this.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:54.920]   OK.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.720]   Quite funny.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.880]   I thought we were still talking about the Goldman Sachs
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:22:59.480]   conference.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.000]   That was it.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.640]   There was a lot of interesting stuff there.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.360]   Tim said some very interesting things there.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:03.880]   What do you say?
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:04.400]   OK.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.840]   Well, that's where he talked about the stories.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.920]   Here's how Bill Gates proved that he really was on Reddit.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:09.560]   You have to do that.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.560]   You have to verify it.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.080]   You could take it.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.280]   That would be so easy to Photoshop.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.480]   That's Photoshop.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.040]   Somebody's got to tell me how to Photoshop.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.640]   You know I'd say, I'm going to Photoshop something onto that.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.040]   Actually, he has Larry King.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:22.720]   Hi, Reddit.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.680]   It was Bill Gates.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.880]   Can you send me that?
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.560]   Where's that photo?
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.960]   I'll send you the photo.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.560]   It's going to say something.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.320]   John has mad Photoshop skills.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.640]   Well, in this case, an idiot Photoshop.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.560]   I know.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.680]   Somebody's got to tell me.
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.080]   Email page location.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.120]   All right.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.000]   While I'm doing that, would you pick another story?
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:42.680]   Mr. Devorex?
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.040]   I don't know.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.320]   Is there anything that I don't know?
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.160]   Give me some chat room story.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.120]   What do you want to know?
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.040]   You got the Valve layoffs?
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360]   So what's going on there?
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.240]   In fact, talking about gaming, I'm
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.280]   actually kind of interested in it.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.800]   I'm interested in that too.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.920]   The Valve Steam box, which will bring PC gaming
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.360]   to the living room, in effect.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.440]   And I apparently would be running Linux,
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.120]   but we'll have Steam games on it.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.440]   Am I right on that?
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.560]   So the Valve Steam box is still up in there exactly what
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.560]   kind of hardware it is.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.360]   But if you get it around 300 bucks--
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.880]   Yes.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.560]   Well, yeah, that's kind of the idea.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.600]   It'll probably be AMD base as well,
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.920]   just because they have a good combined CPU GPU thing.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.640]   They gave us-- come out and said it will run Linux.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.680]   And the problem that that creates for Valve is that--
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.120]   We heard Gabe Newell say how much he hates Windows 8.
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.760]   But maybe to his benefit, Windows 8
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.520]   hasn't really taken fire, right?
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.280]   But the problem with saying it's going to run Linux
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.560]   is that there are very few games in the Steam library
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.680]   that run on Linux.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.720]   If you look at it compared to what the Windows library is
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.200]   versus the Linux library, so he needs to convince people
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.800]   to start building their games with Linux support.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.080]   And then you get into a little bit of the intricacies of which
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.840]   destroy you're going to use.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:12.920]   The graphics drivers aren't quite the same and easy to operate
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:13.640]   as they are in Windows.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.000]   Does the fact that Valve just laid off Jerry Ellsworth
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.320]   and 20 others kind of imply that maybe they're not
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.720]   going to do a Steam box?
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.080]   She was working on hardware.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.000]   I have to get Jerry on the phone.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.640]   When they announced the layoffs, they said no current project
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.200]   was being cut because--
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.440]   No change, right.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.320]   Right, yeah.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.080]   So I still think they're going to do it.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   They've always said that they're going
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.280]   to make an official Steam box, but then they're
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.840]   going to give the plans out to other people
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.880]   to make derivatives, right?
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.000]   And the thing is, is theirs was going to be more locked down.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.880]   You weren't going to be able to access the hard drive
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.880]   to install your own operating systems and mods
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.960]   and that kind of stuff or play around with the operating
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.320]   system in the way you would want to.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:59.320]   But that the idea is to get PC gaming in front of the TV.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.360]   And they did that with big picture mode
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.120]   that's currently available on Linux and Windows versions
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.240]   and Mac versions, I think, of Steam.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.040]   And they're doing it by kind of telling people
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:15.640]   to get controller optimizations in for all of their titles.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.920]   And I think it's a great move.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.240]   Like, I work in front of a computer all day.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.040]   So if I go home and I want to play a game,
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.760]   I really don't want to go upstairs to my office
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.200]   and sit in front of my computer again.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.960]   So the idea of having it in front of the TV is really nice.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.840]   There's still the complication of hooking up
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.280]   a home theater PC to your TV.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.760]   And you get this whole keyboard mouse issue.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.640]   Do you really want to have a keyboard and mouse
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.840]   sitting on your coffee table?
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.920]   I would say for the majority of consumers,
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.160]   they don't want that.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.400]   So you've got to rework all that kind of stuff.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.800]   And I think Valve's probably the only company in the gaming
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.080]   world that would have the power to really get that moving
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:50.760]   forward.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.600]   Gabe Newell said, we don't usually
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.480]   talk about personnel matters.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.320]   But because so much attention is being cast on this,
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.520]   I'm going to take the unusual step of addressing them.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.560]   No, we aren't canceling any products, no projects.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.800]   No, we aren't changing priorities or projects
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.480]   we've been discussing.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.320]   No, this isn't about Steam or Linux or hardware
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.840]   or insert game here.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.040]   We are not going to discuss why anyone in particular is
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.840]   or isn't working here.
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.120]   As many as 25 people laid off, including not just Jerry Ellsworth,
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:21.240]   who has been working on some hardware for Valve,
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:27.640]   but also their Devac director of Biz Dev, Jason Holman.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.240]   They're a very secretive company.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:29.840]   I don't blame it.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.760]   They're private companies, so they don't have to worry about
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.760]   answering anybody.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.720]   Yeah, this is not by Jeff Jarvis.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:35.520]   Hold on a second.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.760]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.600]   You don't know this story?
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.560]   Post of this week in Google?
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.760]   What happened to Jeff Jarvis?
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:41.440]   You don't know about this?
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.160]   No.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.240]   He got on the BBC and he flipped.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.080]   Really?
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.560]   When was that?
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:47.920]   I don't know.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.680]   It was just in the last day or so.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.360]   Did you know that?
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.280]   Chad, we got to ask him.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:53.720]   I didn't.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.000]   He tears into the BBC.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.160]   Shakin' a said though.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:58.680]   Oh, this-- yeah, with the techno panic thing.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.040]   I don't blame him on this.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.440]   No, I would have been on his side too,
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.040]   but I can guarantee he'll never be on the BBC again.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.840]   He said irresponsible crap that you're--
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:11.440]   And the word crap apparently offended the BBC guy.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.680]   The BBC is covering the Facebook hack.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.640]   And he said that the BBC was inciting techno panic.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.440]   This is irresponsible journalism.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.080]   This is crap.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.480]   There's no story here.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.720]   This interview shouldn't exist.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.320]   I said that to your pre-interviewer.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.080]   I say it to you.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.600]   You're just causing a panic and there's no reason for it.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.800]   Answer me that, please.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.400]   Go right on, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.440]   Well, he did it in a very aggressive way.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.320]   Yeah, he won't be back.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.160]   But--
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.840]   No, no way.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.040]   I think that's pretty funny.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:42.480]   Good for you.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.160]   Well, we'll save that clip for this week in Google on Wednesday.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.320]   Well, ask Jeff.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:48.240]   I don't blame him.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.200]   Ask him why he accepted the interview in the first place.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.480]   He could have just said no.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.880]   Because he probably wanted to do exactly that.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:55.040]   He was screaming.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:55.840]   Right?
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.240]   No, he said he did.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:58.400]   He tried to get out of it.
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.760]   But he said, no, no, you got to be on.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.920]   And you've been on-- you know, they apparently made--
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.840]   they pestered him and irritated him.
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.680]   And he went ballistic.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.280]   Well, you know, as someone who's done really stupid things
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:12.080]   on national TV about technology stories that are not really
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.680]   stories, then I applaud that.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.160]   Yeah, I think you're probably sympathetic.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.360]   I think we all are.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.440]   Where you get this heated up anchor saying, oh my god,
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.040]   the end of the world is here.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.200]   And you try to calm him down.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.680]   But I think maybe the best response is you guys are full of it.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.640]   Yeah, knock it off.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.560]   This is not a story.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.960]   It's someone who's done so many stories about that stupid,
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.400]   conficker virus.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.080]   Exactly.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.640]   Oh, we all get it denied.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.560]   So the Facebook hack, just so you know,
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.880]   Facebook disclosed it, it was discovered by security
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.320]   last month.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.960]   Quote, "A handful of employees visited a mobile developer
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.880]   website that was compromised."
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.080]   This has happened to everybody.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.960]   You go to a compromised website.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.000]   It hosted an exploit.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.720]   I believe it was a Java exploit, which allowed malware
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.120]   to be installed on the employee's laptops.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.920]   It sounds like they caught it right away.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.720]   They probably have very good security of Facebook.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.680]   It did raise the issue.
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.480]   And some have written about it.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:06.960]   That it must only be a matter of not if but when
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.400]   Facebook has a major breach that reveals
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:09.960]   personal information--
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.120]   That would have been a good direction
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:11.960]   to take that interview.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.800]   Yeah, and then what happens?
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.720]   Then what happens?
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.400]   As soon as we discover the presence of malware,
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.200]   we remediated all infected machines
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.240]   and formed law enforcement began a sophisticated
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.400]   investigation.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.280]   No user data was compromised.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.120]   But that happens all the time, because if you've
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.200]   got a laptop, you get out on an unprotected network.
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.720]   And if you've got Java installed, they said all the updates
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.560]   were all the security was on that laptop.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.360]   This thing happens.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.320]   This happens.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.480]   You said you wanted to talk about the gadget purchase.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.920]   AOL rings Ryan Block back into the fold.
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.360]   And Peter Rojas, the founder of--
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.360]   and gadget Peter Rojas, and its editor in chief, Ryan Block,
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.920]   back at AOL.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.200]   They left AOL.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:55.080]   They left in gadget.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:58.360]   They said not with bitterness in our hearts.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.000]   Well, that's the way it sounded to me.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.840]   I seem to remember, if I think back,
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.480]   that they were very glad to get out of you.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.480]   Yeah, we're out of here.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:06.280]   They suck.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.560]   And now they're back, of course, because the money's good.
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.200]   I don't know.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.880]   I mean, I think they always--
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.120]   there have definitely been some that left.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.840]   I think the guys who left the verge were a little bit--
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.240]   Joshua was kind of--
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:18.600]   Right?
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:21.840]   But Ryan and Peter, from everything I've heard,
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.200]   they never said much bad about that I remember.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.200]   I think you might be right.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.400]   I'd have to go back.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:29.440]   But I think I tried to get Ryan to say bad things.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:29.880]   And I never--
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.280]   Well, he doesn't go necessarily saying bad things.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.520]   And one of those guys who just keeps his bridges unburned.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.400]   Yeah, I just can't quit you AOL.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.400]   But probably--
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.800]   It was a good payday.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.520]   I believe they had 2.3 million in investment money.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.840]   Like about 4, actually.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.680]   I think it's about 3.8.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:49.080]   Oh, OK.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.280]   Almost 4 million in investment.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.480]   Almost 4, yeah.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.160]   But they got more than that from AOL, right?
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160]   Like 7 or 8?
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.640]   So those guys probably walked away with a couple
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:31:59.320]   middle of peace.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.280]   That's not bad.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.240]   Not a bad payday?
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:08.160]   And I think GDGT.com is very different than Engadget.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:11.160]   They really turned into a review aggregation site, which
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.600]   I think was a smart move.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.000]   And so because they did that, it integrates very well
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.080]   into it, Engadget's offerings.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.600]   Yeah, it's all user-generated content, really, right?
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.520]   It's-- they did some really interesting things, I thought,
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.640]   that they were trying to get users to talk about their
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.240]   experiences with the product.
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:34.520]   And crowdsourcing, essentially, the idea of some of these user
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.960]   reviews, because a lot of the things people do when they
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:41.280]   want to know what-- if they want to buy a product or not,
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.000]   they're going to Amazon and checking out what users say
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:44.480]   about it.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:47.960]   And so I think that what GDGT was doing was trying to say,
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.480]   well, let's take advantage of some of that.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:53.000]   Let's maybe, instead of just a basic review, let's let them do
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.920]   some more stuff.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:57.160]   And then let's let you pick the products you want to follow.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.480]   And then when there's new stuff set about those products,
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.440]   you can get updates on that.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:03.240]   I think it's a pretty good strategy.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.080]   And probably AOL, if it wanted, could
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:09.480]   use that to expand beyond technology reviews.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:12.680]   They could apply that to other categories and stuff.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:15.800]   It's kind of a Rotten Tomatoes thing where they combine
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.480]   official reviews with user reviews to give a score.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.600]   It's very clearly based on Rotten Tomatoes.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:25.600]   So for instance, the gadget score for the Windows Surface 8
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.000]   Pro is a 75.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.920]   They give a short synopsis.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:33.840]   And then they show a synopsis of critic reviews, user reviews.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.760]   So you get an idea of how people who use it are feeling
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.440]   and how people in the trade press review.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.680]   I think this is very valuable.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:43.040]   I thought I was completely on your side
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:46.600]   with the basic theory about Rotten Tomatoes
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:49.000]   until that Skyfall movie.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:49.480]   I know.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.360]   We talked about that last time.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.400]   They liked Skyfall.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:56.760]   They 90% or something.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.200]   It was ridiculous that movie sucked.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.440]   We don't want to get into that.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.680]   We just don't know if it's really--
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:02.920]   How do you like Skyfall, Natalie?
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.120]   Were you a fan?
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.120]   I liked it.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.480]   How did Clayton like it?
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:10.400]   Because I'm guessing Clayton is a true,
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.000]   dyed-in-the-wool bond fan.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.880]   He's got the DVDs and everything.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.400]   I think he does even have some of the books on him.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.320]   Yeah, I had a feeling.
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.360]   I don't know why.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.680]   I see Clayton with a--
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.040]   Goat Martini in his hand.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.920]   Natalie, go to the bookshelf and bring some books down
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.400]   and show us some of the stuff that's got--
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.840]   What's Clayton reading these days?
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.040]   He reads good stuff.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.040]   You know, I know what he reads.
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.400]   Find the embedded stuff that's behind the books.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.320]   You know, he's got a whole collection
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:42.040]   of these originals, of all of the original Star Trek books.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.040]   Oh.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.040]   Oh.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.040]   We go, we go, we go, we go, we go, we go, we go, we go.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.680]   And show you, because he's spent hours on eBay
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.360]   looking for these.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:48.840]   Hang on.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.040]   I'll look.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:51.000]   Oh, poor Clayton.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.680]   I am now feeling really bad about that.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:53.680]   I'm not--
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.680]   I love this.
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.680]   Oh, dear.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:56.680]   He's alive enough to show.
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:58.680]   Vading Clayton's privacy here.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.680]   I'll show you the look he's got.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.880]   Where is Clayton right now?
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.680]   He took our son and his parents to Benihana.
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:07.280]   Oh, isn't that sweet?
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.280]   Are they definitely--
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.280]   They definitely do the knives.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:11.160]   Oh, but I like the onion volcano they do.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.160]   Have you ever seen that?
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.800]   Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't even know.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.280]   See, he's got all of these old--
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.280]   Oh, look at that.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.280]   --like he's got yellow pages, and they're in pristine condition.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280]   The whole--
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.280]   I'm not going to study there.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.280]   The Covenant of the Crown by Howard Weinstein, Star Trek novel.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.280]   That's been really good shape.
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.280]   That's got to be like '70s or '80s, right?
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:31.280]   Look at that.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:32.280]   Yeah, no.
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.280]   And he's got their--
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280]   It's the original cast Star Trek.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.280]   Got tons of them.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.280]   Take their camera over there, Natalie.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.280]   No, I can't say that I'm using a big eye Mac.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.280]   I'm surprised that they're not in plastic.
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.280]   Some of them are.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.280]   And in fact, when he sees the show and sees that I've handled them, I'm probably a big
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.280]   true.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:49.280]   Do not.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.280]   Your job's on.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.280]   Put some gloves on.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.280]   Your finger oil all over it.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.280]   Yeah, and then they blow up.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.280]   You know, they're very malleable and berming and eating.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:01.280]   No one tell him, if someone tweets him right now, I'm going to be mad.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.280]   You know they will.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.280]   Twitter is full of tattle tales.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.280]   By the way, I got to tell you, this is what I hate about Twitter.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.280]   It's full of people who are waiting to tell on.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.280]   Like, I'm sure they already tweeted Adam Curry.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.280]   I'm sure-- you know, they're constantly tweeting.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.280]   You say anything.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.280]   They're like, they're like, they're like, just tattle tales.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.280]   It's deplorable.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:20.280]   I'm in trouble.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.280]   I want to talk about Tesla in just a little bit.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:28.280]   And the New York Times versus Elon Musk battle.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]   Who's right and who's wrong here?
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.280]   It's a publicity stunt.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:36.280]   Ah, it's a very interesting, you know, I keep reading the rebuttal, the argument, the
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.280]   rebuttal argument.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.280]   And I go back and forth and go, oh, Elon, you're right.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.280]   You scored.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.280]   And then I go, bro, you're right.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.280]   That guy was a jerk.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.280]   Oh, you're right, Elon.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280]   Go back and forth.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.280]   So I don't know.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.280]   I'm in marketwatch.com.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.280]   I wrote about the electric thing.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.280]   I still think it's fad.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.280]   Let's talk.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   We'll talk in just a second.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.280]   But first a word from our friends at Citrix and makers of the fabulous Go to assist.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.280]   It is the ultimate.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:00.280]   Yeah, this would be a good time to go to the bathroom or just leave.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.280]   See you later.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.280]   Bye-bye.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.280]   So walk out.
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.280]   It walked out.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.280]   Actually, there's nothing in the refrigerator I can assure you.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.280]   She already checked.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.280]   This place used to have good food.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.280]   I got a couple of red vines.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.280]   We are big on-- you know why?
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.280]   We have red vines.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:21.280]   The fine folks at American confectionery, wherever red vines are made, sent us a case of red vines.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.280]   Huh?
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:23.280]   Did you mention that you liked red vines?
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.280]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.280]   I got you the case.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.280]   There goes Natalie.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:27.280]   She's running off.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.280]   She's quitting too.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.280]   Who makes red vine?
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.280]   She's looking for-- she's putting the buck away.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.280]   She's going to put it-- you know what she's going to do?
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.280]   She's going to put it in the back so nobody-- so he can't tell that she handled it.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.280]   That would happen.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.280]   That's positive.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.280]   Or she'll put it in the wrong spot and he'll spot it.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:43.280]   Hey, were you handling my new argument?
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.280]   I mean, it was in alphabetical order.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:51.280]   He shouldn't be here because he was-- he had to show next to the red stapler.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.280]   [laughter]
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:58.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, I show today brought to you by our good friends at Citrix.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.280]   If you're in IT and I know a lot of you--
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:03.280]   I can be in IT.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.280]   A lot of you are in IT.
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:11.280]   And the worst thing in being-- we were talking on the radio show today about the things the IT people say.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.280]   Did you reboot it?
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.280]   Is it plugged in?
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   Is it plugged in?
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.280]   Is it turned on?
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.280]   Just the things, you know, it's got-- it's a horrible job.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.280]   If you have the right tools, it could be pretty good.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.280]   Our good buddy, Russell Tammany, who is our IT professional here.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.280]   He works at Expedentia.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.280]   He's what they call a managed service provider.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.280]   And it's very interesting to hear how he does his job.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.280]   He's got over 500 clients, three people, and they handle them all.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.280]   And it's because of-- he's actually-- he was using another program.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.280]   We've got him moving over to go to assist.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:42.280]   He says, "This is exactly what I'm looking for.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.280]   It's less expensive than what I've been using."
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   And it gives me all the tools I need to do this kind of managed service.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.280]   Take a look at the different modules now.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.280]   You're probably familiar with go to assist remote support.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.280]   That's the original, the best, the fastest, delivered live support to PCs, Mac, to mobile devices.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.280]   From anywhere, you could do it unattended.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.280]   You could do up to eight sessions at once.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:09.280]   You could-- they have apps for iPad and Android devices, so you could do it on the road.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.280]   It is fantastic.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.280]   But now they've added two new modules.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.280]   The monitoring module, which lets you track performance.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.280]   So what you do is you set up a dashboard.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:26.280]   They have some pre-designed stuff, but you can also create your own that monitors things like server and network health, hard drive capacity, toner cartridges.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:36.280]   You can inventory all the IT assets, hardware plus software, track network usage patterns, and then get text messages or instant messages or email when there's an issue.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.280]   So you can immediately get in there with remote support and fix it.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:48.280]   The service desk optimizes your workflow, lets you keep track of things, including release and configuration management, track and resolve tickets.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.280]   It's just-- I want you to try this.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:55.280]   You get all three of these modules for free for 30 days if you go to the website.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.280]   Go to assist.com, click the try it free button, and use our offer code TWIT.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:05.280]   30 days free, the new service desk is really cool.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.280]   This is everything you need to be more effective, to be a support hero.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:11.280]   Go to assist.com.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.280]   The offer code is TWIT.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:16.280]   Please do try it free today.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:27.280]   So I like this Tesla S. I've driven in a 17-inch screen, a beautiful car, and they claim the largest range of any electric vehicle out there.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.280]   Was it 223 miles, something like that?
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:31.280]   Or 230 something.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.280]   So it's a large distance.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.280]   And they approached a New York Times motor reporter.
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.280]   And--
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.280]   Actually, no.
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:44.280]   I think he was a different-- he wasn't technically a motor reporter.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.280]   Oh, he isn't.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.280]   He's a regular general interest reporter.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.280]   Does his political stuff--
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:49.280]   John Rotor.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.280]   Yeah, he does a--
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   But they did go to him.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.280]   Right.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.280]   And they said, "John, we are so proud of the range.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   We think you can drive a Tesla S and take a road trip."
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:02.280]   Now, this is something you typically don't do an electric vehicle because the range isn't so high.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:04.280]   But we've got so much range.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:07.280]   And we've got these superchargers all up and down the east coast.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   So we invite you to test drive at driving from, I think, New York to DC, or-- no, I'm sorry, DC to Boston to Boston.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:21.280]   Now, he is the Washington Bureau reporter for the Times responsible for the coverage of energy, environment, and climate change.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.280]   So he does cover this, but kind of peripherally.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.280]   He's not an automotive reporter.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:26.280]   Right.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:30.280]   He had all sorts of problems.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:33.280]   It was very cold for one thing.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.280]   And one of the problems you have with these lithium-ion batteries is they're capacity to weigh down.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.280]   There's a lot of problems with them at cold weather.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:41.280]   Not to mention--
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.280]   There are people that are working on that.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:43.280]   Of course.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.280]   But not to mention you also want to turn on the cabin heat because you're freezing.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.280]   Right.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.280]   It's like below 30.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   And that depletes the battery even more.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.280]   Well, I shouldn't do that much.
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.280]   He got to Branford, Connecticut, couldn't reach this supercharger station in time.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.280]   Car broke down, had to be towed.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:05.280]   And the funny point of this was that when the battery went dead on it and he needed to tow the car, it has one of the--
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.280]   And I don't do not like these, by the way.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.280]   Cadillac Volt has this.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.280]   It has one of those--
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:12.280]   Chevy Volt?
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.280]   You know, I've always thought of it.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.280]   Because Cadillac makes a Volt on Monday.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.280]   I know.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.280]   The Chevy Volt.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.280]   I make that.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:24.280]   That's a mistake I make because ever since I tested that car, I kept saying, "Why don't they put the Cadillac moniker on this thing?
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.280]   Why is it a Chevy?"
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:29.280]   And you have this brake that's an electronic brake.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.280]   So you push a button and then your brake comes on.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.280]   However, it locked because the battery was--
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:36.280]   If you turn off the car, he admits I made a mistake.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:38.280]   I knew I wasn't supposed to-- I turned off the car.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:39.280]   Now the brake no longer.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.280]   Yeah, it was locked.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.280]   You're stopped.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.280]   So they had to call Tesla-- TOTRAK GUY had to call Tesla say, "How do you move this thing?"
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.280]   How do you move the--
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.280]   Right.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.280]   It's very funny.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.280]   He spent a lot of time talking to Tesla staff all along the way.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.280]   And then the other thing that I did was I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the car."
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:00.280]   I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the car."
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.280]   I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the car."
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.280]   I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the car."
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.280]   I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the car."
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:12.280]   I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the car."
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.280]   I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the car."
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.280]   I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to go to the car."
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:21.280]   I was racing it around and the thing dropped dead because--
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.280]   Well, this is the funny thing.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:25.280]   It did not drop dead on top gear.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:30.280]   Top gear, in fact, Elon Musk said, "We found the script where they had written--
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:32.280]   Okay, and then we're going to push the thing into--
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:37.280]   It had plenty of charge left, but it was part of the story on top gear that an electric car could run out.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.280]   It never did on top gear.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:47.280]   So, Elon Musk in his blog post says, "Ever since that happened, we started logging what's going on with these cars."
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:52.280]   They got all this information anyway so that we could rebut any lies.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.280]   He said this is--
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.280]   No, he got the New York Times guy.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.280]   The Times guy admitted in his blog post that, "Well, yeah, I guess I wasn't keeping--
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:08.280]   I did put the cruise control on for a while, but I've tested these cars.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.280]   Not this one, but you can't--
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:13.280]   Especially these newer cars that got these great suspensions.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.280]   These cars want to do 80.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:18.280]   And so you're driving along at a really high speed, trying to get to where you're going.
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:21.280]   And in this case, he ran out of juice.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:23.280]   Well, yeah, there it is. There's the blog.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:28.280]   Here's the vehicle logs, and you can see the speeds, but you can see the slower speeds as well.
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.280]   It's the high speeds that burn these batteries.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.280]   I totally believe that these electric cars are not practical.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:43.280]   He shows the charging, and he points out that at one point at the Norwich Supercharge, he stopped, even though it was only 28%.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:48.280]   Musk makes the claim that Broder was trying to-- wrote an intentionally negative.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:49.280]   I don't believe that.
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:50.280]   I don't-- I think--
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:51.280]   --hitpiece.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.280]   And I think Broder's rebuttal is fairly clear that he didn't write a hit.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.280]   Why would he do a hitpiece? It's a really nice car.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.280]   And I think maybe-- I read some of the other articles about this in which they say,
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:07.280]   "Really, the mistake is to pretend that an electric vehicle is for road trips."
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:08.280]   It's not.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:09.280]   No, it's a little--
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.280]   It's a bad use for it.
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:12.280]   It's essentially a golf cart.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:15.280]   It's good for the golf course and maybe to the store.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:18.280]   There's nothing wrong with the fact that it doesn't do all things.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:24.280]   No car does everything, and if you're going to buy an electric vehicle, you should probably not be using it in the freezing climates.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:27.280]   You certainly shouldn't try to hit its 265-mile range.
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:33.280]   There aren't enough Superchargers out there to help you in this respect anyway.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.280]   It's an around-town car.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.280]   If you want to go on road trips, you know, you can still probably make a justification for it.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:42.280]   When I want to go on a road trip like a random minivan,
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:46.280]   or a car that you want to drive, you know, Mustang or whatever.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:47.280]   So who--
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:48.280]   Do you think Musk--
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.280]   Or take a train, public transportation people?
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.280]   Take publics, yeah. There you go.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.280]   Thank you, Natalie.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.280]   Come on.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.280]   Yeah, he could have taken the beautiful Amtrak, the--
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:02.280]   The Estella from Washington to Boston and gotten there in a tenth of the time because--
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:05.280]   Right, and probably nauseous, by the way, in my dad.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.280]   They have power outlets.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:11.280]   And you could plug in your battery, your laptop, and never run out of juice.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.280]   Or your car.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.280]   So what-- I mean, I--
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.280]   [laughter]
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.280]   Actually, yes. Good point.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.280]   Put your car on one of the-- in the cars, like, right?
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.280]   Road the car on--
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.280]   Excellent range.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.280]   There you go.
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.280]   So who was wrong here? Who was right?
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:27.280]   What's your analysis of-- were you following this, Natalie?
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.280]   Yeah, I did follow it, and, um, I don't know, I think they make--
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:35.280]   Maybe they're splitting hairs a little bit. They're kind of--
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:37.280]   Yeah, I think it's more of a use case value than--
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:37.280]   Right.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.280]   You did this, no, I didn't, kind of thing.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:45.280]   Like, maybe, you know, you have to be a bit more careful when you review things like this,
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.280]   and every product reviewer now is like, "Ooh, I really have to cross my--
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.280]   I was gonna say cross my eyes. What's the idea?"
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.280]   Cross my eyes and dot my teeth.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.280]   And dot my teeth.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:55.280]   Yes.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:57.280]   And you do that, and people think, "What the hell?"
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:58.280]   [laughter]
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.280]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.280]   I'm sort of surprised this hasn't happened with other technology, right?
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.280]   Because all these things that you're using,
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:12.280]   there could be tracking technology on the smartphones or laptops
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:16.280]   or other things that people review, and, yeah, it's just--
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:21.280]   It's interesting that Musk had the-- the Hutspa, right?
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:25.280]   To say, "You know what? Go pull the logs, and we're gonna look at what he did,
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:27.280]   and I think he's-- I don't think he's being forthright,
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:30.280]   and we're gonna look at him, and if he's not, we're gonna publish him,
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:34.280]   and we're gonna, you know, take this to task."
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.280]   Out of him.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.280]   We're gonna out him, exactly.
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:43.280]   So, you know, that's what he did, and I'm surprised it hasn't happened before,
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.280]   and I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen again, right?
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.280]   It's part of the world we live in where, you know, privacy's not privacy.
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:50.280]   So--
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:55.280]   And now every electronic maker is thinking, "Oh, we can do that?"
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:58.280]   Because when you get a project to test, product to test,
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:00.280]   you know, the companies don't do that a lot.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.280]   They don't ask for the product back by the time your review publishes.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.280]   So now they might.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.280]   Matthew Ingram wrote a great-- I thought a great piece that really--
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.280]   To me, this is the big lesson of all of this.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:14.280]   The leveling of the media playing field he calls it.
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:19.280]   He says, "Here's what's different, is that Elon Musk is not merely the CEO of Tesla.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:22.280]   Tesla's not just a car company, it's a media company now.
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:26.280]   And because Tesla has a blog and Musk has a blog, they can--
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:30.280]   Instead of just, you know, going crazy and calling the editor and saying,
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   "Hey, how dare you retract that?"
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:35.280]   They can write a piece that gets absolutely every bit as much attention,
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.280]   maybe more than the New York Times piece.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.280]   They can respond.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.280]   That's a big change.
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:43.280]   That's maybe the biggest change of all here.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:46.280]   Matthew says, "Tesla is a media company now."
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.280]   And every company is a media company, because every company can have a blog
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.280]   and have videos can do all of this.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.280]   Yeah, you can take the--
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.280]   The cat room says that Elon Musk is like Tony Stark.
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.280]   He kind of is.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:57.280]   He is.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.280]   Well, actually, he was a Tony Stark who was modeled after Musk.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:00.280]   Really?
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.280]   Right?
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.280]   Anybody else know that?
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.280]   Well, that's why you don't mess with Musk.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.280]   No, Tony Stark is way older than Elon Musk.
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.280]   I think so.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.280]   No, no.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.280]   Iron Man goes back a long way.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.280]   No, not the--
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.280]   Well--
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.280]   The modern movie--
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.280]   Talking about the movie version.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.280]   The movie.
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:15.280]   The director, whoever was--
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.280]   No, I think that's one.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.280]   He thinks he's--
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:18.280]   Yeah, and Musk is like--
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:21.280]   He's like space, he's launching his own thing, he wears great hats.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.280]   I think he's a great--
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.280]   I think he's a great model.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:25.280]   I'm modeled on Elon Musk.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.280]   Did you know that?
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.280]   You look it.
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:34.280]   David Weiner, Matthew Ingram talks about Dave Weiner who says it's the source is going
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.280]   direct.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:39.280]   People's and entities that used to be seen primarily as sources of information for the news and
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:46.280]   media to rewrite are now just going direct, whether it's politicians, celebrities, or car
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:47.280]   companies.
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.280]   They just go--
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.280]   And I think that's true.
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:51.280]   And I don't know if that's a bad thing.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:56.280]   I think it's confusing because you don't now know, do I trust John Broder, do I trust New
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.280]   York Times, do I trust Elon?
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.280]   Well, you can read and--
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:49:59.280]   It's more confusing, but you got more--
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.280]   It's actually--
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:01.280]   I think it's less confusing.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.280]   Because you make up your own--
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.280]   It's gotta be better.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.280]   It's gotta be better to hear both sides of a dialogue, right?
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:07.280]   I mean, just in general.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:11.280]   If you're only hearing one side of an argument, regardless if it's supposed to be from, you
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:16.280]   know, the press that's supposed to be on the consumer side, they should be allowed to
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:21.000]   respond, especially, you know, this might be a little bit overly aggressive, I think, is
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000]   an understatement maybe.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]   But I think it's useful.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:31.640]   You know, you're talking about how much damage can this one article do to their brand and
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:35.840]   their future sales if they believe it's completely false?
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.000]   They should be able to defend themselves.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.960]   If they happen to be able to do it in the public domain, then that's fine.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:41.960]   I agree.
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:42.960]   I thought the whole thing was actually pretty fascinating.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:48.160]   And in the end, we learned a lot more about what really happened in the test drive.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.960]   And we sort of sussed out the whole thing that, you know, this car isn't necessarily
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:54.360]   one that you should take a long way.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:59.160]   Or as Leo said, if you're in a cold climate or if you're, you know, going, you're going
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:04.360]   to push that 200 miles, 250 miles, you know, really think again about it.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.480]   I think that's the takeaway that all of us learned from the whole thing.
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:11.520]   And it was kind of interesting theater as well.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.240]   And I wouldn't, I don't think it was a bad thing.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:19.600]   I actually, and maybe most media people wouldn't feel this way, but I like it.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.880]   I like the loss of gatekeepers.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.640]   I like that everybody gets a chance to speak.
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:23.640]   Yeah, you would.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:29.040]   Emily, Emily Bell, who teaches journalism at Columbia and is a media expert, tweeted
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:34.600]   corporate PR everywhere, reading Elon Musk's New York Times takedown and thinking, Hmm.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.200]   Yes, we can do that too.
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.200]   We need a blog.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:41.280]   The problem is they're not Elon Musk.
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:42.520]   It helps to be Elon Musk.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:45.040]   I mean, this guy's got a lot going on.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:50.120]   But I think that's why more and more companies are looking for a person, whether it's a Robert
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:55.480]   Scoble at Rackspace, Scott Monty at Ford, a person who could be the face of the company
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:59.280]   in that way, in the social, in the social and blogging realm.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:00.960]   And that's very valuable.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:01.960]   That's very.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:05.560]   From a PR standpoint, it may not have been the smartest thing Musk did, honestly.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:09.800]   I would have never read this story if Elon Musk hadn't responded to it, right?
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:13.760]   I would have never known hardly anything about the time story.
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:17.440]   The fact that he blogged about it and then it turned into this whole incident brought
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:20.760]   a lot more attention to all of the criticism.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.080]   So that's the thing you always have.
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.680]   I totally agree with that.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:28.000]   CNN apparently did the exact same run like some days later.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000]   And nobody noticed.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000]   Nobody noticed.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000]   They did make it.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.040]   No problem because they drove slowly there, right?
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.000]   And nobody paid any attention.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.640]   There's a group of seven Tesla S owners making the run this weekend.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:45.680]   They're going to duplicate the times of day that he was driving.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.680]   Wow.
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.640]   There's apparently a caravan of seven of them.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:49.640]   Wow.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:52.360]   You can follow them on Twitter, of course.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.360]   That's another risk.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:56.200]   And that's the other side of it, which is it's great to have fans.
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:57.720]   And I can vouch for that.
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:03.320]   It really is powerful to have a community around a product.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.440]   Really is powerful.
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:08.400]   And if you have people who are fans of the Tesla S, they're going to defend you.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:11.040]   You don't know if you're Elon Musk, you don't have to say word one.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.640]   Yeah, you did change minds.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.480]   Let's get these seven drivers, some quantified self devices.
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:16.480]   How can we read them?
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:17.480]   Oh, here we go.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:18.480]   I'm going to know they're hard-straining.
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:20.000]   I want another blood sugar.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.360]   Curtis Curtis B in the chat room said they should set up a glimpse account and follow
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.360]   it.
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.360]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.360]   We can all follow it.
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.360]   Everybody can follow it in real time then.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:29.360]   That's right.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.360]   We've got the data too.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.800]   I think I'd rather watch Grass Grow.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:34.240]   It's about as fast as grass.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.960]   It's fun because you can see him speed.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.440]   You can see him slow down.
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:39.080]   Oh, that would be fascinating.
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:40.080]   Watch him speed again.
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:41.080]   There he goes faster.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.080]   Now he's going slower.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.080]   He's going slower.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.080]   Not always going faster.
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:45.080]   We're going to take a break.
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:49.080]   When we come back, why is Chubby Checker so upset about an app?
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:50.480]   I'll tell you why.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:55.680]   But first, a word from Squarespace, a brand new feature at Squarespace.
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:57.200]   They keep on doing it.
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.640]   You know we talk about squarespace.com all the time.
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:02.840]   They're a really fabulous place to host your website.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:07.680]   You've got the best servers, best hosting out there.
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:08.680]   Never goes down.
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:10.040]   It can handle all sorts of traffic.
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:13.000]   They've got the best content management on system on top of it.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.280]   Now they've added Squarespace commerce.
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:18.280]   This is so exciting.
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:23.360]   It lets you set up an online store, manage and sell products through your Squarespace
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.520]   site, everything you need.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.600]   You create a professional website, blog portfolio, online store.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.560]   If you're a photographer, you can sell your photos.
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.040]   It is just incredible.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:38.040]   The price is right too as always.
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.240]   The e-commerce solution is integrated to work with every single template on Squarespace.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.440]   Now you can sell physical or digital goods.
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.280]   If you don't have a merchant account, don't worry.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:51.760]   They have a setup that makes it very easy so you can accept payments from credit or debit
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.680]   cards right away.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:58.360]   They can even give you tracking of inventory, email updates.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:01.520]   People, print shipping labels, ad coupons.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.280]   All you need is the business plan subscription.
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:04.880]   So go to squarespace.com.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:05.880]   Set up that site.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:06.880]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:07.880]   You've got two weeks.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:12.320]   Just sign in and set up the store.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:17.880]   Set up an all-in-one platform that has a great website, hosting that never goes down
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:20.040]   and then a store and look at the pricing on this.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.040]   It's fantastic.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:24.640]   They don't take a cut of your sales.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:25.840]   You go to squarespace.com.
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:30.800]   The basic plan, of course, $8, the unlimited plan, $16 a month when you buy an annual plan.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.840]   That includes unlimited pages, galleries, blogs, unlimited bandwidth.
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:36.160]   You never get a bill for excess bandwidth.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:38.080]   You never get shut down for using too much.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.240]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:41.400]   $24 a month.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.240]   Now you've got fully integrated e-commerce and everything else, including the unlimited
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.280]   bandwidth and storage.
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:51.600]   You get tax shipping coupon controls, inventory tracking.
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.320]   Man, this makes this even better.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:56.600]   If you're looking to sell online, if you're looking for a great website, if you're looking
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:59.720]   for a portfolio, this is the place to go.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:04.000]   We've talked about squarespace before and this was the one piece of the puzzle and now
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000]   that they've added this.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.440]   Of course, it took them a while because they wanted to do it right.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.520]   These guys are the best.
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:14.760]   Squarespace.com, as little as $24 a month, do sign up for the annual plan for a couple
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:15.760]   of reasons.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.400]   One, they'll register a custom domain name for you and hook it up, but the other is you
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:23.280]   can take 10% off your first purchase as a new account.
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:28.400]   When you use the offer code, "Twit2", that 10% saves most, of course, when you buy
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:33.080]   an annual plan, squarespace.com.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.040]   Use the offer code "Twit2" when you decide to buy.
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.640]   You don't need that, though, when you just want to try it.
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:40.640]   There was a great video.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:47.240]   Let me see if we can find it on the verge of the CEO of Adobe.
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:56.120]   He's being asked why Adobe products cost $1,400 more in Australia than they do in the US?
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.240]   That's a good question.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:59.240]   It's a very good question.
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:04.360]   Let me just play the video and then I'll tell you the follow-up.
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:06.160]   Adobe now offers two products.
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:07.160]   You can get the creative suite.
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:14.200]   You can still buy physical media, but they want you to use this new cloud-based system.
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:16.520]   Microsoft wants to do this.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:17.520]   Same thing.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.520]   Everybody does.
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:20.160]   Here's Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayan.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.760]   Which I know my readers universally asked, what I mean to ask you, how can Adobe possibly
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:30.200]   justify charging up to $1,400 more for the exact same software delivered in Australia,
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.760]   delivered over the internet with no box copy compared to the US prices?
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:36.320]   Again, I'll answer this question.
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:39.520]   When we look at the creative cloud and where the future of the creation is.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.520]   That's what they want you to buy.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:45.080]   When I talk about traditional software, not with the company.
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:47.440]   We think that's the best offering for customers.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:50.160]   We really believe that if you look at what we've done with price.
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:53.480]   Has this ever happened to you, Natalie, where you ask an executive a question and they just
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.480]   don't even answer it?
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.400]   And we think that's the future of the company?
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.400]   Yes.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:00.000]   To the credit of the reporter, he asks again.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000]   Good.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:06.200]   There's a lot of companies, a lot of individuals who don't want to buy a creative cloud, they
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:08.240]   want to buy a creative suite.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:12.280]   And the creative suite master collection is $1,400 more in Australia.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.400]   But how can you possibly justify that when it's...
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:15.400]   Persistent as the CEO.
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:16.400]   And then the creative cloud just...
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.000]   That's not what I asked him.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.000]   Yes.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000]   He says...
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.920]   He goes back to the pitch.
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:24.920]   You've got to credit...
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:29.560]   You've got to credit him for staying up point.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.320]   Narion, stays on point.
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.880]   He's better than a politician.
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:34.880]   You know a politician will do that.
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:35.880]   Again to the talking point.
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:37.160]   Yeah, don't answer the question.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:38.720]   Just talk about something else.
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:40.720]   Is that the creative cloud is a few stumps feature.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:42.600]   Talking about what journalists really want to do.
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:45.360]   You want to just go over and pinch his lips together and be like...
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:48.360]   The guy behind him, if you're watching the video, the guy behind him saying, "I don't
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:49.360]   want to be here.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.360]   This is embarrassing.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.360]   I'm so sorry."
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:55.000]   What about the customers who want to buy traditional versions of creative suite?
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.480]   Which is still the majority of the...
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:57.480]   Third time, yes.
[01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:01.160]   I know you're talking about the creative cloud in the future, but if that's the case...
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:02.440]   Yeah, but don't say it again.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:04.120]   Why not cut the prices of...
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:07.720]   Why not harmonize the prices of your traditional software if you're...
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:08.720]   If the creative cloud is a few.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.720]   One more time.
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:15.560]   When Adobe thinks about how we want to make sure we attract the next generation, again,
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.880]   the future of the creative cloud.
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:18.880]   Creative cloud.
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:19.880]   Stop it.
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:21.880]   You're really not answering the question.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:24.920]   I don't really have any other way to put it.
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:30.320]   And all I can say is when we think about the future of the creative cloud.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:32.920]   So by the way, this video on...
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.920]   How about ask you anything?
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:41.040]   This video on the Verge, two days later, Adobe drops the price $1400 in Australia.
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.320]   So the power of the internet is...
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.320]   That is wonderful.
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:45.320]   That's beautiful.
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:46.800]   Isn't that great?
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:48.040]   That's beautiful.
[01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:49.040]   He won.
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.040]   Credit.
[01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:52.640]   I don't know the guy's name, but lots of credit to him for asking questions.
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.880]   He got his talking points across.
[01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:00.120]   There's no doubt that people are going to have to eventually go to this rental model.
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:01.120]   Microsoft's...
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:03.000]   I think doing it right with the Office 2013.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000]   You don't like it?
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.600]   You don't like it with Microsoft's done with their strong arm tactics.
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.120]   Well, they really want you to do it.
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:10.120]   They say you're going to do it.
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:12.720]   If you're going to buy it, you can buy it, but you can't move it to another machine.
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:13.720]   You can't upgrade your machine.
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:14.720]   We're just not going to...
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:15.720]   It's not going to...
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:16.720]   It's going to not work.
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:17.720]   You can do it, but you won't be happy.
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.360]   They wanted to do this since XP, right?
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:24.560]   When they released XP, XP stood for experience because they said we're no longer...
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:27.240]   This is going to be the end of selling box copies.
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:31.160]   You're going to rent it from us into yearly subscription.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:37.320]   It was such a backlash and they were a little scared of it, so they backed off on that.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:41.080]   But they've wanted to do this since 2001, since they released XP.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.560]   XP was supposed to be the end of numbered windows.
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:48.000]   It was going to be experience, windows experience.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.280]   I'm surprised they haven't done it sooner, but it's inevitable.
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:56.920]   It is pretty shocking that Microsoft says when you buy Office, it's tied to this PC
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:58.400]   and this PC only.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:01.120]   If you upgrade, if you cannot move it, that's it.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.120]   It used to be you'd get a disk.
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:04.120]   You can move it up to the next computer.
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:05.120]   Right.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:06.400]   Uninstall it from the old computer.
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.320]   You cannot do that.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:10.480]   It's very user hostile.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.480]   It is.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:14.880]   So, now what you have to do is pay a hundred bucks a year and you get...
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:16.240]   But I think that's a good deal.
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:20.040]   You get Office 365, you get full copies of Office Mac or PC.
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:21.040]   Five versions.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:22.280]   Five, you can get on five different computers.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:23.480]   I don't think that's a bad deal.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:24.480]   That's cool.
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:25.480]   No, that's the idea.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:26.480]   They make it.
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:27.480]   So, here's your...
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.480]   You've got a choice.
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:29.480]   Here's a crappy idea.
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:30.480]   Or here's a good idea.
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.480]   Or here's a bottle of loot.
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:32.480]   Up to you.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:37.240]   Sorry, I said that.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:41.480]   Speaking of which, Chubby Checker is very upset.
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:43.120]   You know Chubby Checker do the twist?
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:44.960]   Yeah, the Hank Ballard song?
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:45.960]   Yeah.
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:46.960]   He's ups...
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:58.840]   He's suing HP because apparently there is an app called Chubby Checker that is actually...
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.840]   It guesses the size of your manhood.
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:01.840]   What?
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:04.280]   There was an app.
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:05.280]   And it was on WebOS.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.920]   And it was only downloaded 84 times.
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:11.240]   Yeah, that sounds about right.
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:17.000]   But he's still mad.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.240]   He trademarked his name in 1997 and you cannot...
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:23.640]   Although it's a good name for an app that...
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.360]   You give it your shoe size.
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:29.360]   And then...
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:30.360]   I kind of would buy it.
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:33.160]   I have an old-fashioned methodology.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.600]   Does that work?
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:41.360]   You take three-quarters of your shoe size and convert that to inches or something.
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:42.360]   See, she knows.
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:45.040]   Have you checked us out to make sure it's accurate?
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.040]   She knows.
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:47.520]   Not just Sephora Kate's page.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.520]   She knows other things.
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:50.520]   I know they are.
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.080]   I'm just teasing you.
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:53.080]   That's terrible.
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.320]   I love Natalie Morris and I want you to come back.
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.120]   We just had to give you a little hard time after the...
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:58.120]   She loves you so much.
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:59.120]   She calls you Morrison.
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:00.120]   I might be...
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:01.120]   Morris.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:02.120]   And it's added on.
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:03.120]   Yeah, you did.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:04.120]   I don't call her Natalie Morrison.
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:05.120]   It's Morris.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:06.120]   Interesting.
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:07.120]   No.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:08.120]   That's fine.
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:09.120]   I still go back to Natalie Conte.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:10.120]   Del Conte.
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:11.120]   She used to have her own logo.
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:12.120]   She used to have her own logo.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:13.120]   You had a Del Conte logo?
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.120]   It was...
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:16.120]   Yeah, it was the Del Monte logo but with Del Conte inside of it.
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:17.120]   Oh, that's so cute.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:18.120]   It was cute.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:20.120]   Why did you change your name?
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.120]   She didn't want to keep the logo.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:24.120]   Oh, you know family and all of that stuff.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:25.120]   Just for the logo.
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:26.120]   Keep it.
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:28.120]   She could put Morris in that same old logo.
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:29.120]   And take the logo.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:30.120]   And the logo would be Morris.
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:31.120]   Yeah.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:32.120]   Then you'll get sued by Del Monte.
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:35.920]   The great thing would be if you did that with the Morris thing instead of Del Conte, only
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:39.120]   the people that know you well wouldn't get the joke.
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:44.120]   It would be like the hardcore cranky geeks fan who would know that.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.120]   Exactly.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:46.120]   And the other people you want to know.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:48.120]   Were you a regular on cranky geeks with Mr. Devorak?
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:51.120]   You know what cranky geeks is how I got my start and broadcaster.
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:52.120]   No.
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.120]   Yes, it is.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:54.120]   You discovered Natalie Morris?
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:55.120]   You went like this.
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.120]   We put her on the air.
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:01.120]   Then she got nothing but hate mail from the typical geeks out there that liked to harass
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:02.120]   women.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.120]   She was in tears.
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:05.120]   Talked her it down.
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:07.120]   Got her back on the air again.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:08.120]   The same thing happened.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:10.120]   Said, no, don't worry about it.
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:11.120]   Believe me, you'll break through.
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:12.120]   She comes on the third or fourth time.
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:13.120]   They love her.
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:14.120]   And that's it.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:15.120]   They gave up.
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.120]   No, they didn't give up.
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:17.120]   You know what happens?
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:19.120]   You realize how smart Natalie is.
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:21.120]   She is one of the smartest people I've ever met.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:23.120]   And you and really deep.
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:26.120]   And I think that's what happens is at first you go, oh, you know.
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:28.120]   No, they test the fire a lot with women.
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.120]   They try to give the women grief.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:31.120]   I know it's a shame.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:32.120]   I really think it's a shame.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:33.120]   It's very true.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:34.120]   It's too bad.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:35.120]   I love cranky.
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.120]   As a matter of fact, I was supposed to be on The Last Show.
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.120]   The day that cranky geeks stopped, I was supposed to be on.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:40.120]   I showed up for the show.
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:42.120]   And I'm like, nothing's happening.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.120]   Oh, no.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:44.120]   I picked John.
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:45.120]   I was like, John, what happened?
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:47.120]   He said, oh, yeah, this is The Last Show.
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:49.120]   I was like, oh, you knew I was coming on so you canceled it.
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:50.120]   I think you should bring that show back.
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:51.120]   I feel the whole thing.
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.120]   That was a great show.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:56.920]   Yeah, I remember the quote specifically someone said, if I ever have to watch this girl on
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:59.120]   camera again, I will shove a shrimp fork in my eye.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:01.120]   That's horrible.
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:03.120]   She actually remembers this.
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:04.120]   How could anybody say that?
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:06.120]   She was deeply upset by this.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:08.120]   We had to do a lot to get her to.
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:09.120]   Oh, now she came back.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:10.120]   You know, she finally talked.
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:12.120]   You were working at Cina at the time or where were you?
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:13.120]   No, I was at PC Magazine.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.120]   She was a writer.
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:16.120]   Oh, you were a writer at PC Magazine?
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:17.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:21.300]   - She could bring back cranky heaks.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.060]   - Maybe-- - And then I would correspond
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:25.700]   with the people, like, how dare you hurt my feelings
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:26.740]   and the producer at the time,
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:27.580]   and- - Oh, never responding.
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:29.220]   - Analyze, I was like, quit responding to them.
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:30.500]   And I just- - Oh yeah.
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.540]   - She made early mistakes.
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:35.660]   - And like actually getting to a dialogue with these people.
[02:05:35.660 --> 02:05:39.580]   - Analyze's savage knows what you listen to, and Analyze's.
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.860]   - I know, she was like, "You must stop this,
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:44.780]   "she almost ripped my keyboard out of my keyboard."
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:45.640]   - She was like, " bridged."
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:47.900]   - You are not correct in your assumptions,
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:48.900]   but you're just gonna be writing back and forth.
[02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:50.500]   - These guys, look, I got her, I got her.
[02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:51.620]   She's talking to me.
[02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:52.460]   - Would it be?
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:53.540]   - I mean, what a stressful problem.
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:54.380]   - It's not a stressful problem.
[02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:57.900]   - Yeah, would you rather have a horse-sized shrimp fork
[02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:02.020]   or a hundred duck-sized, I don't know.
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:05.140]   You know, I think we should bring back cranky heaks.
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:07.540]   We could call it angry nerds.
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:08.780]   - You could call it a crank cranky heaks.
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:09.940]   I'd give it to you on that?
[02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:10.780]   No, I don't know. - Do you know what it does?
[02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:11.900]   If it owns it.
[02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:12.740]   - Oh.
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:13.580]   - But we can get it.
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:16.580]   - I don't have good experience trying to get names back.
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:18.740]   - We're trying to get- - I could do it.
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:20.860]   - We're talking to G4 right now,
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:22.780]   or whatever what G4 used to be.
[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:24.460]   - Now it's gonna be the Esquire channel.
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:25.340]   - The Esquire channel.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:27.380]   We're talking to them, it's actually NBC Universal.
[02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:29.940]   We're talking to them because they have the old,
[02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:31.620]   they have the servers from tech TV,
[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:35.620]   they brought them down to LA and put them in a drawer somewhere.
[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:36.660]   - So they have all the old shows?
[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:38.500]   - They have, well, the servers had clips,
[02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.420]   not the full shows, but they do have tapes
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.380]   of all the old shows.
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:43.940]   10,000 shows, they have 10,000 tapes.
[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:45.100]   - I don't believe this for a minute.
[02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:46.420]   - They throw in those tapes out.
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:51.140]   - They said that the cost of career up to us would be prohibitive.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:53.380]   So we're making a pitch, this is what we're making a pitch.
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:55.220]   We want one show a week.
[02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:56.820]   - No, go down there and get them.
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:58.300]   - Yeah, go down and get them.
[02:06:58.300 --> 02:06:59.300]   - Really?
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:00.140]   - Get them to van.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:00.980]   - With a van?
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:01.820]   - Get cargo van.
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:03.900]   - Fly down, rent a van, haul them back.
[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:04.740]   - All right.
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:06.620]   - I guarantee you won't get anything.
[02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:07.460]   - I don't think they'll get them to us.
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:09.420]   - I don't think they're existing because I was going-
[02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:11.980]   - No, they swear they are, I'll show you the email.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:14.220]   They're a storage locker.
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:15.060]   Swear to God.
[02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:17.620]   - They're gonna throw all the silicone spin shows out.
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:18.780]   - Well, I don't care about silicone spin,
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.260]   I wanna get the screensaver shows.
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:21.420]   But I was thinking-
[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:22.580]   - Why would they throw it at you?
[02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:24.860]   - I was thinking we could do a screensaver rerun
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:27.780]   every week and we could come on and comment
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:28.660]   and make fun of it.
[02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:30.700]   - Put the three little, the silly ones in front of the thing.
[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:31.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:32.380]   - Like a science theater.
[02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:33.660]   - Yeah, do mystery science theater
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:35.500]   with the old screensavers, wouldn't that be fun?
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:36.340]   - That would be awesome.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.180]   That would be fabulous.
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:38.980]   - You bring me back on the episodes I was on.
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:40.740]   - Yes, you'd come back Ryan on the episodes
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:43.380]   you were on, the young Ryan Shrout.
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:45.540]   That was back when it was what, AMD?
[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:46.380]   What was it called?
[02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:47.700]   - AMDMB.com.
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:48.700]   - Yeah.
[02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:50.700]   - That was probably-
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:51.540]   - 1990.
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:52.380]   - 19, 19 years ago.
[02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:53.220]   - Yeah.
[02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:54.060]   - 12 years ago.
[02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:55.140]   - It'd be so much fun.
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:58.660]   So we just, everybody tell a Comcast NBC Universal,
[02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:00.100]   please do that.
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:02.220]   We said we'll trade the promotional value,
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:04.500]   we'll figure it out, we can't give you cash for them,
[02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.020]   but we'll figure out something, you know,
[02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:08.740]   we'll put an ad in there for you, you're gonna have an ad.
[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:10.900]   I just think it'd be so much fun.
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:13.180]   Anyway, that's my idea.
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:14.780]   You're gonna have to go down and get him.
[02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:15.780]   - Get a van.
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:20.340]   Yes, no, it doesn't do any good to say it in the chat room.
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:23.980]   You have to tell NBC Universal somewhere where they're reading.
[02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:25.220]   - Yes, some guys.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:26.820]   - NBC really said-
[02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:28.820]   - And he'll feed, free the screen.
[02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:29.660]   - And he'll feed.
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:31.500]   Now that guy will feel that he's done his part.
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:32.340]   - I've done my part.
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:33.180]   - Yeah.
[02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:34.020]   - Now it's a appeal.
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:34.940]   - Yeah.
[02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:36.540]   - Hey, if you missed anything on Twitch,
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:38.380]   you missed a mountain of stuff.
[02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:40.980]   Let's take a look at what we saw this week on Twitch.
[02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:44.420]   Previously on Twitch, Matt Break Weekly.
[02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:46.580]   - It makes it more likely that if you choose a device,
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:47.780]   you'll choose an Apple one because,
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:50.220]   "Hey, look, look at the awesome other stuff I can do with it."
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:53.460]   And I think so far, the technology that we've seen,
[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:56.300]   whether it's Siri or iMessage or anything else,
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:58.900]   makes an iWatch look more like an Apple TV style
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:02.060]   companion device than a full-on iOS device.
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:03.900]   - This week in computer hardware.
[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:08.300]   - I myself am anticipating multiple handheld pedals,
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:11.220]   along with a head-mounted display.
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:12.660]   - The straps do you choose?
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:13.500]   - That's what I'm gonna go with.
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:15.860]   They actually don't announce any hardware specifications
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:17.540]   for a replacement station.
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:18.620]   That would be harsh.
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:19.900]   - Triagulation.
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:21.380]   He wasn't the guy in South Africa.
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:22.740]   - No, no, this is--
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:24.060]   - He's still there in South Africa.
[02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:24.900]   Just--
[02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:25.740]   - Yeah, he's my high school buddy.
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:27.380]   I left him there and said, "See you."
[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:31.620]   - He's like, "Oh, my sure, no one takes our servers."
[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:32.980]   - Gizwiz.
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:35.020]   - Oh, another remote control car.
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:37.460]   I've so many remote control cars.
[02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:39.620]   - But Mindplay's music.
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:41.740]   - This plays music.
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:42.980]   I'm interested.
[02:09:42.980 --> 02:09:43.820]   - Twit.
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:44.660]   - Tech.
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:45.820]   - Just like you like it.
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:48.300]   - But Mindplay's music.
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:49.940]   It does.
[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:50.900]   - That's a sales pitch.
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:53.100]   - Yeah, make sure you watch "Twit All Week Long."
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:54.340]   Lots of great shows for you.
[02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:55.900]   And if you do wanna be here live,
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:57.980]   we love it if you stop by Sunday afternoon.
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:10:02.980]   It's 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2300 UTC.
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:06.780]   Thank you, Irina, for the hat, the Twit hat.
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:09.140]   I think it's very flattering.
[02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:11.020]   Thank you all for being here, John C. Dvorak,
[02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:11.860]   Channel Dvorak.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:15.340]   Would you please ask your buddy Adam Curry,
[02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:17.740]   "What's the deal with the meteor?"
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:19.180]   - Why don't you get him on the show one of these days?
[02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:22.220]   - No, no, he'll brandish a weapon.
[02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:23.460]   Scares me, actually.
[02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:25.060]   - He's in Texas.
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:26.540]   - Oh, all right, that's far enough away.
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:27.660]   Probably couldn't shoot all this way.
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:30.020]   - Yeah, dvorak.org/blog, too.
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:31.020]   Don't forget that.
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:32.780]   Get somebody that used to drink on that.
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:35.260]   - He used to get a lot of traffic now.
[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:36.100]   You still do that?
[02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:37.980]   You put stuff up there and stuff.
[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:38.900]   It's still going?
[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:39.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.020]   - 'Cause it was a great place to go.
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:42.620]   It used to be in the day.
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:45.500]   Great place to go for stuff like crazy articles and things.
[02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:46.700]   - Yeah, you still do that?
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:47.820]   - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Really?
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:48.700]   - Yeah, there's a good article.
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:50.820]   - Facebook, not pairing there.
[02:10:50.820 --> 02:10:51.660]   - Do you know that?
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:52.820]   And he's given the finger?
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:54.500]   - Yeah, a million, multi-million dollars.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:55.500]   That's good.
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:56.340]   - That's a good article?
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:57.180]   - Yeah.
[02:10:57.180 --> 02:11:00.460]   Noah Genesha, red bag of poop.
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:03.820]   That's an interesting article.
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:04.940]   - That was not an article.
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:06.060]   That's a show. - That's a show.
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:06.900]   - Actual show.
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:07.900]   - All right.
[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:10.900]   Anyway, thank you so much for being here, Ryan Shrout.
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:12.740]   Make sure you watch this week in computer hardware
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:15.020]   with Ryan and Patrick Norton.
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:17.700]   Every Thursday, 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:20.420]   Great show, PCPer.com.
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:23.580]   And I'm constantly pointing people who call and say,
[02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:26.540]   on the radio show, I wanna build a computer.
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:29.220]   I say, you gotta look at the PC perspective leaderboard
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:31.020]   'cause they keep it up to date constantly.
[02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:34.300]   The parts you should put into your inexpensive PC,
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:35.860]   your dream machine and everything in between.
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:36.700]   I really like that.
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:38.340]   - I can tell when you make that, when you make that,
[02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:39.180]   - You get hits?
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:41.260]   - I get a little alert on my phone.
[02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:44.100]   Whenever we see drastic increases or decreases,
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:46.580]   I get little notifications.
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:47.940]   So I appreciate it.
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:49.140]   - And you keep it up to date.
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:49.980]   - You keep that up to date.
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:51.620]   So it's really a great resource.
[02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:54.660]   I don't know if people still build systems, but it's...
[02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:55.740]   - Everybody builds them.
[02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:58.380]   - It's actually making a pretty big resurgence.
[02:11:58.380 --> 02:11:59.220]   - Really?
[02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:01.980]   - I think a lot of that is because PC gaming
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:03.420]   is having a resurgence.
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:04.660]   And if you want a gaming machine,
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:06.900]   you really do wanna choose the ability yourself.
[02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:09.300]   - Yeah, a really good gaming machine.
[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:10.140]   Thank you, Ryan.
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:10.980]   It's great to see you again.
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:12.300]   I appreciate you coming on.
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:14.940]   Thanks to Jason Heiner of Tech Republic,
[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:19.940]   techrepublic.com, a CBS interactive site.
[02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:21.340]   - That's right.
[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:22.180]   - Always a pleasure.
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:23.020]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:24.020]   - Love having you on.
[02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:26.260]   And the great Natalie Morris.
[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:27.860]   We really appreciate it.
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:29.100]   - Thank you for the invitation.
[02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:29.940]   - Natalie.
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:30.780]   - It's good to chat with you guys.
[02:12:30.780 --> 02:12:31.820]   I'm sorry I offended you, John,
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:33.300]   with the age-related joke.
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:34.140]   - We gave it back.
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:34.980]   - Oh, that's right.
[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:35.820]   She did that.
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:36.660]   Now she's reminding us.
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:38.220]   - We gave it back in this space.
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:40.580]   - Very good, very good.
[02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:41.780]   She'll meet her doom.
[02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:44.700]   - We are the statler in Waldorf of tech reporting,
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:46.460]   so it's okay.
[02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:48.740]   - And can I just quickly tell everyone about the app
[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:51.820]   that Clayton and I started was a re-quick app.com.
[02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:54.940]   So if you want a speed read on your iPad, check that out.
[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.140]   - Are you taking credit too now for it?
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:59.100]   - Well, it was sort of a family effort.
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:00.260]   - I didn't know that.
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:02.100]   So you know the whole story, of course.
[02:13:02.100 --> 02:13:03.660]   - I know it will.
[02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:04.660]   - So--
[02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:06.020]   - Don't poop on my app.
[02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:08.020]   - I'm not gonna poop on it.
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:08.900]   I didn't understand it.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:13.300]   See, we were doing an iPad Today episode about news reading,
[02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:14.420]   and Sarah shows this,
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.700]   and then it shows one character at a time.
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:18.020]   - No one character, one word.
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:18.860]   - One word at a time.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:21.260]   I said, that's a silly way to read news,
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:22.820]   but it isn't a news reading app.
[02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:25.620]   It's a speed reading app.
[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:27.140]   - It's a speed reading app, right?
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:28.580]   So if you have long form content
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:30.140]   that you want to get through quickly,
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.980]   it's kind of like spreeter on the web.
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:33.300]   I don't know if you've seen that before,
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:35.260]   then it shows you one word at a time,
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:37.660]   and you can get through long form content so much faster.
[02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:40.100]   In fact, you guys sent me a mountain of stories
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:41.420]   to get through today.
[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:43.500]   So I saved them all in pocket,
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:45.300]   and then was able to get them and read quick,
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:46.660]   and this go through them so much faster.
[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:48.220]   - Did you really do that?
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.060]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:50.620]   - You find this faster.
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:51.780]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:53.140]   - Gives me a slight headache.
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:55.540]   - And also, it helps me to not fool around.
[02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:58.660]   If I read something else on my tablet or on my computer,
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:01.460]   I'm like, "Don't you see what someone's tweeting me
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:03.860]   "and did so and so see my baby picture and like it,
[02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:05.180]   "you know, of my daughter."
[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:06.580]   So I hate time. - Well here's the answer.
[02:14:06.580 --> 02:14:08.420]   - I'm gonna put Finnegan's wake on this thing.
[02:14:08.420 --> 02:14:09.980]   - Oh, that'd be a good way to read it.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:10.820]   - Yeah.
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:12.780]   - I'll put it in pocket and we'll read it together.
[02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:14.100]   - That would be great.
[02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:15.540]   - Is available on the app store,
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:17.060]   how much is it, two bucks?
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:17.900]   - No, no, not you,
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:19.620]   this Finnegan's wake is the one you want.
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:21.100]   - $3.99.
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:21.940]   - Yeah.
[02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:25.780]   - And when, you know, I gotta say, after we mentioned it,
[02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:28.700]   it did become the number one app on iTunes.
[02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:30.700]   - I do know this, thank you for the plug.
[02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:32.820]   - So I didn't heard it at all.
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:35.420]   My particular problem with it did not hurt it.
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:36.260]   - No, why would it?
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:38.740]   Publicity is publicity, it's proof positive.
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:41.100]   - Yeah, and now that I know it's a speed reading app,
[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:43.060]   that's a different story.
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:46.500]   - Yeah, you should try it for one week of your--
[02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:48.860]   - You think I'll be able to read faster?
[02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:50.780]   - I think you should be a Finnegan's wake in.
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:51.620]   - I'll put Finnegan's wake in.
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:53.540]   - See if you can get through, I mean,
[02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:55.380]   - I've never been able to get through Finnegan's wake.
[02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:56.620]   - You have to read it twice actually.
[02:14:56.620 --> 02:14:58.780]   - It doesn't do books yet, so.
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:14:59.620]   - Oh, I'll just--
[02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:00.460]   - I'm gonna try it.
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:01.300]   - I'll steal it.
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:02.900]   - I'd encourage everybody to read my articles
[02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:04.020]   very slowly though.
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:05.060]   (laughing)
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:07.020]   - Like you write them, right?
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:08.380]   - Whoa, hey, oh, oh.
[02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:10.100]   - Whoa, oh, hey, yeah.
[02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:11.580]   - No, he says slow journalism.
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:12.420]   - Thoughtfully.
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:13.420]   - Thoughtfully is what I was looking for.
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:14.420]   - Yes, slow journalism.
[02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:15.260]   - Slow journalism.
[02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:16.100]   - Slow journalism.
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:17.260]   - Slow journalism.
[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:18.220]   - Thank you all for being,
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:19.860]   I actually don't read the stories before the show,
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:21.740]   I like to be surprised.
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:23.620]   And that works out really well.
[02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:26.060]   Thank you, thank you all for being here.
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:27.940]   We'll see you next time, another Twit.
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:29.300]   - Mm, is in the can.
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:30.140]   - Yay.
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:34.060]   (applause)
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:36.640]   (upbeat music)
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:38.400]   - Do the Twit, all right.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:40.280]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:41.120]   Do the Twit.
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:41.960]   All right.
