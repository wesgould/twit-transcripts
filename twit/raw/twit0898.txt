[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. We got a great panel.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.000]   Lou MM is here.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   Lou Mareska from this weekend enterprise tech, the technologizer,
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.920]   Harry McCracken from Fast Company,
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.920]   and from a brand new publication.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.800]   You remember her from Wired Magazine.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.960]   Louise Mizzakis will talk about Semaphore, her new job,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.120]   and Elon Musk.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.800]   He's got five days to make a deal with Twitter.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.960]   Then he says he's going to fire almost everybody.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960]   We'll talk about the artist who's burning all his paintings,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.920]   if you just buy an NFT.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.520]   And is the iPad strategy making any sense at all?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.600]   All that and a whole lot more coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.920]   Podcasts you love.

[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.080]   This is Twit.

[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.160]   Tech news I have assembled for your Delectation and Pleasure.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.760]   A wonderful panel, starting with the technologist,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.280]   himself, Harry McCracken.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.560]   Hi, Harry.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.240]   Really, huh?
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.080]   Global technology editor at Fast Company.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.440]   And I always think of you as our archivist,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.680]   because you are keeping vintage technology alive.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   And I love that.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.120]   I'm trying.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.400]   I've got a lot of this stuff I'm sharing.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.240]   I don't actually own.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.560]   I just find it on the internet.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.600]   But it is fun.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.560]   People seem to love it.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.040]   I got just on Wednesday, Jerry and I
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.560]   drove up to visit the guy who was the executive producer
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.760]   for the site on MSNBC, which was, I think,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.240]   the first daily network technology show in 1994 or '05.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.080]   And he called me, he said, I'm moving.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.200]   Do you want it?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.720]   It's like a 80-pound giant neon sign that says the site.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.840]   I said, of course I want it.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.720]   So we've got to figure out how to hang it up in here.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.880]   But then he said, it's only on loan.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.080]   When you're done with it, I want you
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.760]   to send it to the Computer History Museum.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.600]   I said, do they want it?
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.480]   He said, yeah, yeah, it's historic.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.800]   I said, OK.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.200]   He's donated a lot of stuff to the Computer History Museum.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.760]   Back when MSNBC really was, MSNBC.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.240]   MSNBC.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.280]   That's right.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.360]   That's why they did it.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.440]   I was working at Ziff Davis, and they called and they said,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   if Microsoft's an investor, they want a daily technology
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.320]   show, can you guys figure something out?
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.400]   And that's sort of what we proposed.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.560]   Not exactly.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.760]   Also joining us with a brand new job,
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.640]   I'm so thrilled to have Louise Mazzakis here,
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.920]   formerly the wire of Wired.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.760]   Not the wire.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.360]   Oh, big difference.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.760]   The wire is in a little bit of trouble.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.960]   We'll talk about that later of Wired magazine.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.760]   But also now at a very hot new media startup, Semaphore.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.200]   Hi, Louise.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.160]   Hey, thanks for having me back.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.600]   In your fifth day.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.560]   No, the fifth day of the site, I guess.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.040]   But I think I've been at the company for, I think,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.200]   about a month.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.360]   But yeah, we launched on Tuesday.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.680]   Very exciting.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.440]   This is the new media startup by the two Smiths, Ben.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.040]   And what's your--
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.720]   Justin.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.320]   Justin, that's right.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.720]   Not related.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.760]   And it was for a long time kind of stealth,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.720]   like we knew that they were starting something,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.160]   but we didn't know what it was going to be.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.240]   And now we know it's-- what is it?
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.280]   I mean, it looks like a newspaper,
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.120]   but it's more than that, right?
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.560]   Is it tech-focused?
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.640]   No, so we are a new global media organization
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.200]   that is kind of taking a slightly different approach.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.240]   So I think the elevator pitch is sort of like the FT
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.560]   meets sub-stacks, or we're trying
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.240]   to break sort of global business and politics stories
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.840]   that have serious impact.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.000]   But we're also doing something interesting
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.080]   with the way that we present the news, we hope.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.440]   So the idea is sort of to take apart the article.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.760]   So every story you read on Semaphore right now, at least,
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.920]   we're sort of going to hope to experiment as well.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.080]   But for now, the stories all have the news.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.560]   And then sort of at the bottom, there is the reporter's opinion.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.080]   And then maybe just room for disagreement.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.840]   So like someone who might disagree or another way
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.400]   of looking at this issue.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.920]   And then hopefully a more global perspective on that story.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.960]   So in a story I did this week, for example,
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.800]   it was the view from Shenzhen.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.400]   And it was interviewing a source on the ground in China
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.240]   about their kind of viewpoint about TikTok's e-commerce strategy.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240]   So that's a good example.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.400]   Like we sort of want to give you a different way
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.360]   to think about the story.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   And also maybe the way that someone in a different place
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.480]   is thinking about that story.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.920]   So you're going to still focus on tech,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.520]   but it's not exclusively tech.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.360]   When I first heard about it, I thought, oh, God,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.120]   is this going to be another bright bar, another right wing?
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.640]   But there's no political point of view in this, right?
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.320]   No, yeah, I think the idea is that we kind of want
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.160]   to have maybe some different perspectives.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.440]   Like there might be someone who's a little bit more
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   moderate or has a different perspective on this.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.120]   But a lot of what I'm going to be doing is covering China
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.000]   in tech.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.800]   So--
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.320]   Oh, how interesting.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.800]   Wow.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.440]   Yeah, for this story in particular.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.200]   So I think a lot of what I'm going to be doing
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.160]   is like, how is this looking from China's perspective?
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.000]   What is sort of maybe what is Africa
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.240]   think of what China is doing?
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.560]   Or what is Southeast Asia think?
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.280]   So I think that's going to be a lot of my job.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.800]   I do have one little mention coming from our chatroom.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   And as they do point this out, that the sun currently
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.400]   rises in the east and sets in the west.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.040]   Your globe is spinning the wrong way at the time.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.680]   Oh my god, that's amazing.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.640]   They might want to--
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.760]   It's a tiny little thing.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.160]   And I'm--
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.160]   Oh, that's incredible.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.040]   But this is our chatroom in a nutshell.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.760]   It totally is.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.440]   It totally is.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   Yeah, they sing.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.880]   Incredible.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.120]   Yeah, the sun's rising the wrong way.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.760]   That's easy to fix.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.200]   I just love seeing that.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.760]   I love the look, honestly.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.280]   Thanks.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.600]   Yeah, I think the design is really fun.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.880]   I think it's like--
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.400]   I don't know.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.320]   It's a little vintage.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.760]   I think it's not a joke, but the line, I guess,
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.880]   that we have been saying a lot is like we're not
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.480]   trying to innovate when it comes to ethics,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.720]   like the core sort of tenants of journalism.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.600]   And I think in some way, our design is like an homage to that.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.360]   We may be trying to do things that are innovative,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.320]   but it's a journalism--
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.040]   And is the focus really on the newsletters?
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.800]   The hope is you'll subscribe to the newsletters, mostly.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.400]   Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that we
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.760]   want to be platform neutral to some extent,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.040]   but we do believe that this is a great way to reach people
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.600]   and to have a direct relationship with your audience.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   I love this.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.920]   You're not relying on Twitter or on Facebook's algorithm
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.400]   that week.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.640]   I think it's good to build that relationship,
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.200]   and we really want to have that.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.400]   Please tell me if the globe is spinning wrong.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.240]   I want to hear those.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.760]   Well, this is--
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.640]   And we should say this is beta.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.800]   Have you fully launched now?
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.840]   You've launched, but there's a lot of work to do for sure.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.360]   We're out there now, and we want people to sign up,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.040]   but we're also definitely in a phase of like,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.920]   we want to experiment.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   If you think something's not good, let us know,
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.400]   and we want to be humble about that.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.000]   I think this is a really interesting trend in journalism
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.560]   that was, in a way, kind of started by substack and medium,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.280]   which is kind of celebrity--
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.400]   I hate to use the word celebrity--
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.800]   revered, respected, journalist covering it directly.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.040]   The byline becomes more important.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.960]   And I think that's completely appropriate.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.520]   I want to know what Louise Mazzakis has
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.560]   to say about these subjects.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.880]   So I think this is great.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.520]   And all the other-- you've got great people,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.880]   Reid Albergotti and Liz Hoffman.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.800]   You've got great people.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.280]   So I subscribed to Puck as well.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.880]   And I think that for the same reason,
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.680]   because it was the people that I was subscribing to,
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.800]   that I was interested in.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.200]   So I'm thrilled.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.280]   Because I want to hear that perspective.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.240]   That's what we do, right?
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.960]   You listen to our shows not because we're giving you the news.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.280]   You know what the news is.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.680]   We're giving you perspective on the news.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.920]   Hey, speaking of which, we got Lou Mariska also in the house.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.800]   Principal, engineering manager at Microsoft.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.640]   He is also the host of our Enterprise Tech Show,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.880]   this week in Enterprise Tech, "Twiet."
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.560]   And always--
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.440]   Always have fun in that show.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.240]   Always welcome.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.040]   It's always great to have you on, Lou.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.200]   I appreciate it.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.000]   So a great panel.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.600]   I was telling them before the show began,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.880]   I hadn't really put the stories in order.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.920]   And Louise suggested, we'll just sort them alphabetically.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.800]   So the number one story today is American Airlines
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.560]   is trying to stop--
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.560]   I'm feeling-- you know what?
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.080]   It's not a bad way to organize it, right?
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.360]   I don't think it's a bad idea.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.440]   We'll start with the A's.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.160]   We'll end with the Y's.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.880]   YouTube will be the last story.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   Why not go through it alphabetically?
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.440]   Why not?
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.760]   Why not?
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.240]   Why not?
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.560]   Actually, I don't know if this matters very much.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   But apparently there is an app, a third party
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.160]   app that flight attendants love for American Airlines
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.720]   called the Sequence Decoder.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.680]   It helps you figure out where you are in the roster
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.160]   and where you're going to be and so forth.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.920]   I guess it scrapes AA's information.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.080]   It's not official.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.840]   American Airlines has been blocking it.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.320]   When you get on the plane, it doesn't offer its own version
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:35.680]   of the app.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.440]   It has turned out requests from the app's developer
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.800]   to work with him, Jeff Reisberg.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.360]   They have to scrape the data from AA's computer systems.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.080]   But instead of working with Jeff AA,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.960]   get it first in the order, has started
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.040]   to protect its websites with bot detection software
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.720]   that makes it nearly impossible to collect the data.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.800]   They don't want flight attendants to know this.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.400]   One flight attendant said, according to paddle
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.480]   your own canoe.com, which I gather
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.960]   as a site for flight attendants.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.480]   One flight attendant said that she'd never seen a company go
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.800]   out of their way to make life harder for their workers.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.480]   Another said on Reddit that the app was so much more efficient
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.280]   and easily accessible than American Airlines
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.160]   and own software.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.760]   It's like these companies go out of their way
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.920]   to be adversarial.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   And there's so many jobs in this world
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.680]   where your schedule is all important
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.920]   and you have no control over it and don't learn what it is
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   until the last moment.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.280]   And you would think American would either make it easy
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.440]   or cooperate with a sky or rip off his ideas.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   They're actually suing the points guy, who was, as you know,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.360]   very popular travel website, Airline Points website.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.920]   He was also scraping data using customers,
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.280]   American Airlines Advantage accounts.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.440]   And AA says, that's a breach of its terms.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.040]   And he's luring customers to break its terms and conditions.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.000]   So they're in court over this.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.840]   It's a shame when companies feel like they have to be adversarial.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.280]   You cover enterprise technology, Lou.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.960]   Don't companies understand that making your workers
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.400]   and customers happy is the right way to run a business?
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.520]   I mean, you think that these companies are bringing value
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   to American Airlines.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.520]   And they're doing better than what they're already doing.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   I mean, I don't understand when they don't have open data
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.720]   policies.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   Now, this doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.320]   I think all companies should allow open data policies,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.280]   even if they have to register, they can regulate it
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.560]   and they can offer better value by having third parties do it.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.080]   I just don't understand it.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.880]   Well, there you go.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.400]   There's our AA story.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.840]   Let's look at what's next.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.960]   No, I'll pick some more important stories.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.160]   Let's talk about Elon Musk.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160]   It's a little out of order.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.600]   But Elon and Twitter apparently have five days
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.160]   to close their deal.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.200]   The court imposed deadline for coming to an agreement.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.440]   Remember, Elon, if you haven't been following this,
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.000]   offered to buy Twitter then-- and want to buy Twitter
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   then offered to buy-- anyway, the last thing in this off
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.440]   and on relationship is Elon says, oh, I find--
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.000]   because he didn't want to go to court apparently.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.080]   I'll buy it.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.840]   And now he-- the court said, all right,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.640]   we're going to put off the trial, which
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.680]   was scheduled to bring in last week for one month.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:30.240]   But you have to come up with a deal by the 28th.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.680]   And apparently, right now, even as we speak on a Sunday,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.400]   Twitter and Musk's people are talking hard.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.840]   Morgan Stanley stands to lose as much as half a billion dollars
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.320]   on this.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.720]   They have agreed to fund the purchase up to $13 billion.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.320]   But the biggest story is that one way or the other,
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.320]   lots of people are going to be out of work.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.120]   Twitter has said, we're going to fire 25% of our staff.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.960]   Elon now has said, I'm going to fire 75% of the staff.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.120]   So what if this closes-- and I imagine
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.560]   they have to get regulatory approval-- but if this closes,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.960]   and suddenly Elon Musk is running Twitter,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.600]   what are the prospects for this company?
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.920]   Harry, what do you think?
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.560]   I should say there's also these stories
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.440]   about the feds being nervous about Elon Musk's role
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.800]   as a global player.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.400]   He's being investigated, right?
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.600]   And a guy who seems to be talking out
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.400]   solutions to the Ukraine war on Twitter and so forth,
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.880]   and he was a close relationship with China because of Tesla.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.960]   So that's yet another monkey rat shot.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.400]   This came out in the court filings.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.360]   Twitter said on a filing released on Thursday
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.200]   that Elon Musk is under investigation.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.640]   It didn't say what the exact focus of the probes was
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:59.040]   and which federal authorities are conducting them.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.960]   Musk's attorneys provided a privilege
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.560]   log identifying documents to be withheld.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.600]   The log referenced drafts of a May 13th email to the SEC
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.400]   and a slide presentation to the FTC.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.560]   So this gets more and more complicated by the minute.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:21.040]   Musk says he's going to invite Trump back.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.000]   Has he officially said that?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.800]   I think he said it was a mistake to kick him off.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.920]   I'm not sure if he's quite gone so far as to say yes,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.520]   I will invite him back.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.960]   I should see what the source is for that.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.280]   But I did see a story that said 75% firing
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.400]   and I'm bringing Trump back.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.160]   So let me see if I can find the source for that.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.440]   And on the 75% fire range, I think he's also told people
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.840]   he plans to hire more people.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.720]   So given this is Elon Musk, you don't know what's going to
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.960]   happen until it doesn't happen.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.120]   That's crazy.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.080]   The Washington Post said that Musk plans to slash Twitter's
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.920]   workforce by 75%.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.560]   This was, I guess, in the presentation
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.680]   that he gave to potential investors.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.560]   So when he was looking for funding,
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.040]   Twitter executives themselves say 25%.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.680]   It does feel like Twitter would probably be fine with fewer
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.760]   people, maybe a lot fewer people.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.360]   I think even if it could be run well with 75% fewer people
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.840]   would be incredibly bruising for it to happen.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.480]   And presumably if your goal is to keep the 25% who are most
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.360]   important and best, this experience
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   might be so traumatic for them.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.400]   A lot of them will leave too.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.840]   And certainly, anyone that--
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.640]   I mean, one of the primary things I'm concerned about
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.400]   is essentially the possibility that Twitter, which actually
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.360]   has made a fair amount of progress in terms of managing it.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.080]   So it's a little bit harder to be a horrible troll on Twitter
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.160]   than it once was, that they'll lose all that progress they made.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.120]   And yes, maybe it will be a place for free speech flourishes.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.400]   But in a way, which will leave anybody trying
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.520]   to be constructive, way less inclined to be there.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.920]   And it will--
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.240]   Forget Trump.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.800]   Is he going to bring the A back?
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.200]   That's really what everybody cares about.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.400]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.000]   Louise, you have an opinion on all this?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.840]   Yeah, I mean, I have two things to say.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.120]   I think one Harry is really right that a lot of this looks
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.080]   to me and feels to me and smells to me like Elon
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.280]   trying to find ways to get out of the deal.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.480]   Still, even with him changing his tune.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.040]   Yeah, I still think that a lot of this,
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.160]   especially when you have really high paid lawyers involved
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.800]   and you have someone like Elon, I just
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.960]   think who's leaking this information and why
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.160]   is a good question.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.760]   And then I think on the second front,
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.480]   about a potential national security investigation,
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.160]   I think that there's good reason for that.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.240]   And we shouldn't dismiss that.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.360]   For example, fairly recently, I think
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.880]   that the story didn't get as much attention as it deserved.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.520]   Elon Musk wrote an op-ed in the cyberspace administration
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.560]   of China's like quarterly journal.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.920]   That's literally the propaganda department.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.880]   And he wrote like a nice little article in that journal.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.560]   Elon has to love China.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.720]   They're a big customer for Tesla automobiles.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.080]   They're even made in China.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.360]   In fact, I've heard Tesla owners say the best--
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.760]   if you want to get a Model 3, get one made in China.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.160]   They're much better than the ones made in the US.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.520]   Right.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.480]   He has a lot of business interests.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.440]   He said all sorts of stuff about Ukraine, about US politics.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.520]   And the only thing we've really gotten him
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.520]   to say about Chinese politics is maybe it wouldn't be so bad
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.920]   if Taiwan and China were reunited.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.320]   That's his--
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.080]   That's the official CCP position, right?
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.640]   I think the only thing he's willing to say
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.080]   is that might not make everyone happy.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.040]   It might cause World War III.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.120]   But you know.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.760]   Just in a way, he talks so freely about other topics.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.840]   It's phenomenal.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.560]   I mean, it's just phenomenal.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.920]   According to Bloomberg, one of the issues
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.880]   in the negotiations with Twitter
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.400]   Musk wanted to reserve his right to file a fraud lawsuit
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.560]   after the sale goes through over his claims.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.440]   The platform's executives misled him.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.400]   So maybe that lends some credence to what you're saying,
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.040]   Louise, that he doesn't really want to buy it.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.680]   This is more just messing around, slowing it down, perhaps.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.480]   He doesn't want to go.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.200]   One thing he doesn't want to be do is deposed, I would imagine.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.280]   The offer to buy Twitter came the day before he was
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.200]   scheduled for depositions.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.560]   There may also be issues with some of his messages.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.480]   Remember, in discovery, his text messages were released.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.160]   There is some question about the text messages
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.680]   he might have exchanged with Mudge, Peter Zacko, the whistleblower,
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.840]   Twitter executive who was fired and then said
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.760]   Twitter was doing a terrible job and wasn't secure.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.960]   It's a mess.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.680]   Can you make any sense of this, Lou?
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.400]   I want to talk about the people side of it.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.760]   I think Harry is right in the one thing that--
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.040]   I think it might be in the past.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.200]   Once they have all these deals of talking about firing,
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.720]   people are going to run for the hill.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.400]   Who at Twitter does not have his resume, her resume,
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.960]   ready to go?
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   Right.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.800]   Who wouldn't?
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.320]   Right?
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.640]   I mean, at this point, you're not
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.080]   going to keep anybody good.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.120]   So I think it's time to just clean house at this point.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.320]   Yeah, you know at least a quarter of you're going to be fired.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.200]   Maybe three quarters.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   That's the other question is--
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.640]   maybe there's some excess.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.880]   Maybe there's some fat.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.320]   But firing 75% sounds like you would lose a lot of the security
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.520]   and safety and user safety people.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.120]   I hate to say the fat's probably staying.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.560]   It's the fat that's going to stay.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   It's going to leave it.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.120]   The developers, the people that are going to leave it,
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.440]   they're going to get people, right?
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.200]   The people that are worried about being at a company,
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.280]   that's not going to be run well.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.600]   So I think that's the thing.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.080]   People who are worried about their jobs
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.160]   are probably going to want to stay to see how long they can
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.240]   keep it, right?
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:05.720]   Actually--
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.240]   Go ahead.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.720]   Go ahead.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.220]   Sorry.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.240]   I was going to say the other thing.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.560]   So that little confounding is at the same--
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.520]   excuse me.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.920]   At the same time he's doing this, he's
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.240]   talking about how Twitter should be the foundation for an
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.040]   everything app that doesn't just let you send out tweets, but
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.200]   let's you do everything else you want to do on a smartphone.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.840]   And it's a little hard to resolve that desire, what the
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.760]   desire to be 75% smaller staff wise.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.040]   Yeah, he thinks there could be a WeChat-like app in the
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:34.720]   United States.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.600]   He wants to call it the X.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.400]   I have to say some of that may just be more hype about why
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   you should lend me money so I can buy this thing as opposed
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.040]   to something he really thinks can happen.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.200]   Louise, do you think you could create a WeChat in the US?
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.880]   Probably not.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.120]   And I think that I've never heard Elon say anything
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.640]   convincing otherwise.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.240]   Of course, who knows.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.680]   But I think a really convincing argument is that
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.560]   Western consumers have credit cards and they learn to use
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.440]   the internet through their browser.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.800]   Whereas the whole concept of a super app is around WeChat
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.280]   and Alipay, right?
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.680]   So you pay through those apps.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.640]   So once you're like, have people's credit card information,
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.200]   it's a lot easier to add doctor's appointments and e-commerce
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.800]   and all these other things are booking a table at a
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.400]   restaurant.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.800]   You can sort of pile that all on, especially to people who
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.480]   aren't used to opening their browser.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.240]   But we have credit cards, we have big banks.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.800]   People still like to shop through their browser.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.000]   So I don't know, I've just never heard Elon actually
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.880]   articulate anything in response to those arguments or say,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.600]   why is now the moment to bring a super app to the US?
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.400]   What would that add?
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.320]   I already have Uber.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.840]   I already have the Amazon app.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.800]   Well, we'd have one app to rule them all.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.360]   Yeah, Amazon's not going to let that happen.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.720]   Amazon's the one who's going to create that, not Twitter.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   Of course--
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.480]   We've seen that out to basically try to turn all those apps
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.120]   into something reasonable.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.840]   And everything app, Facebook and Instagram and WeChat,
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.440]   and they oftentimes they tend to launch this stuff,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.160]   especially on Messenger and then give up on it after a while
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.400]   because it turns out that people want to use Messenger
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.000]   to message not to do anything and everything.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.800]   It's also the case that WeChat grew up
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.760]   in a communist regime that had absolute control over the
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.440]   populace.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.360]   I mean, I think without the government supporting WeChat,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.080]   I don't know if it exists.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.920]   And I should point out there was just an article by J.E. Young
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:50.320]   in the MIT Technology Review, the dark side of WeChat
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.840]   because it's a way for the Chinese government to control
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.880]   its citizens.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.360]   If you get banned from WeChat, good luck doing anything,
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.840]   buying railroad tickets, getting your dry cleaning back.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.160]   One reason that it succeeded in China
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.440]   is there aren't any--
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.560]   you don't have Messenger or WhatsApp or Telegram or Signal.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.280]   They're all blocked.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.120]   So of course, WeChat, if the Chinese government says,
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.400]   you're going to use it, that's all there is.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.480]   And it gives them an interesting degree of control,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.960]   doesn't it?
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.520]   I mean, there are a few other--
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.080]   Go ahead, Lisa.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.960]   I was going to say the ubiquity of the payment thing I really
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.320]   think can't be underestimated.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.880]   Noodlecart on the corner is going to take WeChat pay, right?
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.080]   They're going to take Ollie pay.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.920]   I think when you just have so much of commerce flowing
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.680]   through one app, it's really so much power to have that.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.360]   It's also useful to the government
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.760]   because many people get all of their news in China
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.360]   from WeChat.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.000]   Article's published on WeChat.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.960]   They're not going through search engines.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.480]   They're not going to Reddit.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.840]   They're getting it from WeChat.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:12.040]   And that Chinese government has absolute control over it.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   This is a great article.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.440]   If you want to really understand why it's something
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.120]   we don't want in the United States, after all,
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.480]   I mean, already we're complaining
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.800]   about how big, big tech is, sure, we're
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.120]   going to let Elon run every transaction.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.720]   I just think it's a non-starter.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.040]   And I think Elon knows that.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.560]   Don't you think that it's just BS?
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.040]   Intentants for the investors.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.160]   Yeah, I mean, I think the writing is on the wall.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.880]   He was asking for it with the $30 this count a couple weeks
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.760]   ago now, so now.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.680]   He's already trying to get out of the deal.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   It's just not.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.360]   We're going to take a break.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.960]   When we come back, we can talk about Blue Sky.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.480]   This was something Jack Dorsey-- he was a little time bomb,
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.040]   actually, as it turns out.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.840]   The Jack Dorsey left behind when he left his CEO of Twitter.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.520]   He had already funded, I think, to $15 million of funding.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:09.080]   A decentralized social network, Blue Sky has now released its protocol,
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.040]   its open source, some ideas.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.920]   It's maybe getting a little closer towards a decentralized Twitter.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.120]   So even though Jack Dorsey said he thought Elon was the only guy
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.560]   who could run Twitter, I think he may have left behind just
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.080]   a little bit of a time bomb.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.880]   We'll talk about that when we come.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.440]   And then we'll get to the Bs and the Cs and the Ds.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.880]   It's great to have all three of you.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.920]   Technologize your Harry McCracken.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.600]   My buddy wanted to come up.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.520]   I appreciate that.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.840]   We're still shut down in the studios.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.880]   We had a couple of cases of COVID last week.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.640]   So to protect you and your trip to Lisbon, we're going to--
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.160]   Thank you, Lee.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.800]   I'll keep you at home.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.680]   Also, Louise Mazzakis, great to have you.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.040]   Brand new job at Semaphore.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.080]   We'll talk more about that in just a little bit.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.600]   I'm very excited.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.680]   I'm actually-- now that I've seen it, very, very excited.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.880]   We needed something like this.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.200]   I think it's great.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.760]   And Lou Mareska, Lou MM from our wonderful show
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.720]   this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.320]   Did you go to it?
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.720]   Did you participate in Ignite?
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.040]   Did you have some duties there?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.920]   I did participate.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.520]   Yeah, I was excited about a lot of things
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.320]   I was talking about other than maybe the rebranding of what
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.160]   of office.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.280]   But other than that, we're good to go.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.960]   Well, it turns out, according to our experts on Windows Weekly,
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.240]   it wasn't rebranded.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.680]   It's still office.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.520]   It's still office.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.120]   It's packed in there somewhere, right?
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.240]   You are on the office team, right?
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   Yes, I'm on the Excel team, basically,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.000]   on the office platform team in Excel.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.840]   And we were a little surprised by it, actually.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.120]   Oh, by the way, it's going to be Microsoft 365.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.480]   But you know, like you said, I'm exchanging for those.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.680]   Yeah, and I think a Paul and Mary Jo kind of clarified
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.600]   last week and said, no, that's in Enterprise.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.720]   It's still going to be office.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.560]   That's right.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.000]   It's going to go to Microsoft 365.com now, which is, you know,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.920]   I'm awful.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.520]   Oh, really?
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.080]   OK.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.680]   So here's the story from Thrott.com.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.240]   No, no, Microsoft Office is not going away.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.600]   No, it was kind of a miscommunication.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.840]   But no, it's fine.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.800]   Yeah, apparently they didn't tell you either.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.360]   All right, we'll talk about that, too.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.840]   That's all coming up as we continue this week in Tech,
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.000]   or show today brought to you by my favorite source of audio
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.760]   books, audible.com.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.280]   We've had Audible as a sponsor for more than a decade, I think.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.880]   And I've been an Audible subscriber since the year 2000,
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:41.520]   22 years as a very happy Audible subscriber.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.040]   It started because I had a two-hour commute every day,
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.480]   minimum two hours, usually more as much as four hours,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.000]   from here to tech TV back in the early 2000s.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.680]   And I was just going nuts, listening to the radio.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.560]   When I found Audible, they didn't-- at the time, there wasn't even
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.400]   an iPod yet.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.640]   I had to get a little Audible device,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.960]   then I got a diamond Rhea.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.680]   Remember that?
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.200]   Listen to my audio books.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.880]   Changed my life.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.160]   Changed my life.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.360]   Well, now here we are, fast forward a couple of decades later.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.400]   Audible has everything you'd ever want.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.040]   An incredible selection of audio books across every genre,
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.680]   from bestsellers and new releases, celebrity memoirs,
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.280]   there's mysteries, there's thrillers, there's motivation,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.440]   there's wellness, there's business, there's more.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.200]   You'll discover exclusive Audible originals too.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.480]   I love sci-fi.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.960]   They've taken a lot of famous sci-fi novels
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.800]   and turned them into audio books.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.280]   No one had done it before.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.200]   So Azimov, Heinlein, some of the great classics,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.440]   audiobooks, and they're wonderfully produced.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.720]   That's another thing I love about Audible originals.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.600]   Sometimes these are full cast recordings.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.560]   For instance, if you love Neil Gaiman's Sandman series,
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.600]   you will love the Sandman audio books.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.800]   There's three volumes now fully acted out,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.720]   like the best radio play you ever heard.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.280]   It brings the Sandman to life.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.760]   It's frankly, it's better than the TV show.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.600]   It's fantastic.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.680]   That's just another example of what Audible's doing,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   I think, to really transform the audio space.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.320]   You get, as an Audible member, one title a month
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.600]   to keep from the entire catalog,
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.080]   including the latest bestsellers and new releases.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.400]   You also get access to a growing selection of audio books,
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.120]   Audible originals, and podcasts
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.560]   that are included with your membership.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.760]   You can listen to all you want
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.120]   and get more added every month.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.160]   I've started listening to the Fletch series.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.120]   Cost me nothing, doesn't count against my subscription.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.280]   It's just part of my subscription.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.880]   I love this.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.120]   You can listen wherever you want in the Audible app
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.240]   anytime, anywhere, while traveling, working out,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.640]   walking, doing chores, you decide.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.960]   Great audiobooks, great performances,
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   available anytime.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.080]   It's just wonderful.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.080]   I want you to try Audible right now.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.800]   Let Audible help you discover new ways to laugh,
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.640]   to be inspired, to be entertained.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.880]   New members can try it free for 30 days.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.520]   Is it Audible.com/twit or text to it to 500-500?
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.520]   That's Audible.com/twit or text TWIT to 500-500.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.760]   That's great if you want to just put it on your phone.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.640]   They'll send you a link, you can install it right there.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.680]   30 days free, Audible.com/twit.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.000]   Thank you Audible for saving my life all these years.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.080]   I really appreciate it.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.040]   And for your ongoing support of this week in tech.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.800]   Audible.com/twit, enjoy it, you will.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.160]   Actually, I did want to mention,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.400]   as long as we're talking about podcasts,
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.160]   pocket casts has gone open source,
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.760]   which is fantastic.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.120]   Pocket casts has gone through a series of owners.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.640]   They were sold to public radio, right?
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.600]   And then, let's see, they got sold again.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.520]   Automatic.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.960]   To automatic.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.240]   And automatic, in fact, we had Matt Mullenweg
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.920]   on Twig a couple of weeks ago, is all about open source.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.920]   So they've announced that they've open sourced pocket casts,
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.520]   which is good for a couple of reasons.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.160]   One, you can look at the code,
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.240]   but two, you could fork it if you want it,
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.520]   which is really interesting.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.320]   I love Matt and I love his philosophy.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.520]   Mullenweg said, "We believe that podcasting cannot
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.680]   "and should not be controlled by Apple and Spotify,
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.200]   "right on and instead support a diverse ecosystem
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.120]   "of third party clients."
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.800]   They're using the Mozilla Public License,
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.760]   which means you can fork it,
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.920]   you can do whatever you want with it,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.840]   but you must then license it the same way,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.320]   make it open source as well.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.160]   Awesome.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.480]   - Lou, I think a lot of code would be open sourced
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   if the developers were embarrassed by the code
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.400]   or more importantly, the comments, right?
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.840]   You see the code.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.200]   - I mean, the comments are stripl,
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.040]   I mean, there's semantic tooling
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.320]   that strips all comments out of it,
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.160]   so that's not a problem.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.720]   If you probably went and saw a lot of the old code
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.960]   that's being put on GitHub, that old Microsoft code,
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.280]   that the team went in and added tools to it
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.200]   that basically shipped all the bad comments out,
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.880]   'cause there's some stuff in there that you wanna...
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.280]   - Comments people write, not just for the public,
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.920]   for the other people on the team and for yourself.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.840]   - Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.280]   - Somebody's gonna understand them.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.600]   But I think you're right.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.880]   I think most of the time,
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.400]   it's a lot of these companies,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.360]   they like to, like for instance,
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.160]   this company's putting out just iOS and Android,
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.400]   they have a barrage of other platforms
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.880]   that they're not putting the code out for,
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.440]   like Windows and Mac and Alexa and Sonos
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   and Apple Watch and stuff like that, right?
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.240]   - Yeah, I think that's their business plan there, right?
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.200]   So I think they're offering two big platforms
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.400]   for open source so people can do what they want with them
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.320]   and then they keep kind of their other platforms.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.800]   That's a lot of users as well,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.240]   kind of behind the back door.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.760]   But I think developing and open is the biggest thing.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.800]   I think that some companies do what they call
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.680]   developing and developing and open,
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.080]   which means they still develop privately,
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.800]   but then they kind of sync their code
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.120]   with the public repos eventually later on.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.440]   I feel like Google does that with Chrome.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   So there's a lot of companies that do it that way as well.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.280]   So they still have their kind of like,
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.720]   their IP behind the back door, you know, so to speak.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.800]   - I think it's also just, I like seeing the code.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.320]   I think for somebody, a young person getting started,
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.200]   like if you're interested in Swift,
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   to see how accomplished professional coders use Swift
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.600]   to make a shippable products is great.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.040]   And it's all there on--
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.920]   - It's a great way to learn.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.160]   - Yeah, and it does look like they've stripped comments,
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.000]   by the way.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.560]   (laughing)
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.480]   I don't see a lot of comments in here.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.600]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.280]   Yeah, good on them.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.120]   Good on them.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.480]   It looks like they're using Ruby as a glue language as well.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.320]   I noticed a lot of this is Ruby gems.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.560]   I mean, it's great to learn how people do this stuff,
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.960]   especially a program like this has been around for a long time.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.200]   - It's really why, it's funny that you said that
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.800]   'cause it's really what brought VBA to being really popular
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.720]   is when they allowed you to record things
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   and then you looked at the code
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.040]   and you actually learned how to code
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.120]   from the fact that you recorded that thing.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.600]   I mean, it's really learning how to code is an important thing
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.800]   from this aspect as well.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.000]   - Yeah.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.240]   - Automatically, such an interesting portfolio
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.640]   of acquisitions that's made,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.400]   it's made lots and lots of relatively small acquisitions
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.480]   and it's willing to do things with them
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.880]   that great big technology empires probably wouldn't do.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.240]   And this is a good example.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.160]   - Well, and Matt has said, and he even said it
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.720]   when he was on Twig a couple of weeks ago,
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.440]   that he believes in open source.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.560]   - The code labels, he walks the lock?
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.640]   - Yeah, they say one of the phrases
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.800]   in the company's mission statement is,
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   I know that open source is the most powerful idea
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.840]   for a generation and most of automatic stuff is open sourced.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.280]   I think it's great.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:11.000]   You agree, Lou, I mean, you write closed code all the time.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.080]   - I don't actually.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.720]   I think all of the office platform stuff
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.320]   is mostly open source, all of our most of our stuff.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.160]   - Really?
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.920]   - Office.js and everything like that, yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.760]   - That's awesome.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.080]   - Obviously there's proprietary code, like client code,
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.640]   Excel is proprietary code, that's closed door stuff.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.840]   But most of the stuff that from a platform perspective,
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.760]   we opened it.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.120]   - Yeah, and that's the answer, by the way, too.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.120]   There are a lot of calls, oh, open source windows.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.360]   A lot, there is a lot of proprietary code
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.120]   that Microsoft licenses, I would imagine, in there, right?
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.240]   So it's not all in your control.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:52.440]   You can't just willy-nilly release code that you paid
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.880]   somebody else to use.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.400]   So, but I do love, I love open source, I love seeing that.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.760]   That is, by the way, one of the tenets of Blue Sky,
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.760]   which is Jack Dorsey tweeted this three years ago now.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.160]   Twitter is funding a small independent team
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.720]   of up to five open source architects, engineers,
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.520]   and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.600]   for social media.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.800]   The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.520]   of this standard.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.760]   This probably is not what Elon wants to do with Twitter.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.600]   I'm thinking.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.640]   - I don't think so.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.480]   - No.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.040]   - Didn't he text his own brother,
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.280]   blockchain, not possible, right?
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.120]   - Yeah.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.160]   - Yeah.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.160]   Blue Sky on Tuesday launched a website for its protocol,
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.160]   which they're calling the @protocol, which is clever.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   It's not the @ sign, it's AT, the @protocol,
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.960]   atproto.com.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.040]   It's federated, which is like Mastodon.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.640]   The idea is anybody can run a server
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.680]   and then content from any given server
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.800]   can be followed on any other server,
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.760]   connect with anyone on any servers using the @at protocol.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.560]   That's actually one of the strengths of Mastodon
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.240]   and of the Fediverse, it's GNU/Social, the platform.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.480]   You can, this, I'm not sure exactly how this would work,
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.480]   but an open market of algorithms.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.760]   I guess the theory being Twitter has an algorithm
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.280]   when you're watching, there's two ways to watch Twitter
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.600]   right now, the latest tweets or the best tweets
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.640]   and that's algorithmically chosen.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.360]   You could choose your own algorithm.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.760]   And then I think this is the most important,
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.800]   portable account, the ability to take your account
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.240]   out of one server and put it on another server.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.640]   So it's out.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:53.320]   - I find this one interesting because activity pub
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   is another protocol that's been out there for a while
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.400]   and it's a standard.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.200]   So I don't know why they're creating a new standard
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.360]   rather than just offering to help build out activity pub.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.240]   So that's why I find this quite interesting
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.520]   'cause it also is very decentralized, yeah, exactly.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.400]   And another thing too is, they've had their protocol,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.280]   the, this particular ATP protocol has been out for a while
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.160]   from Blue Sky since May, actually,
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.120]   it's been in GitHub, open sourced.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.360]   And there's not a lot of people forking the code
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.480]   and contributing or even looking at the code at this point
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.880]   because of the fact that they think,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.400]   hey, why are you creating a new standard?
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.400]   Does this make any sense?
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.880]   Like why would we use this when there's one
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.720]   been around for a while?
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.360]   So, I find it interesting to follow up
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.440]   with how they're doing in a couple of years.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.360]   - So Mastodon is based on activity pub as well.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.000]   So anybody who's using activity pub for whatever,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.440]   their Twitter clone, there's actually an Instagram clone,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.320]   PixelFed that uses the same activity pub.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.440]   They all interoperate.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.080]   I mean, I think that's fantastic.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.200]   But it hasn't taken off.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:06.440]   Notice that, you know, Twitter's the 350 million user
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.560]   behemoths in this space, not these other guys.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.200]   - There's also the Liberty Project,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.120]   which is another attempt to decentralize social networking
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.520]   and let you have an identity you can take
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.240]   between social networks.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.880]   I don't, I think maybe it's kind of focusing
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.960]   on other aspects of that challenge rather than trying
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.200]   to turn Twitter into an open algorithm.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.080]   But I mean, there've been things like this going on
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.680]   for a long time and intellectually,
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.200]   they're really interesting.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   And obviously nerds are interested.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.040]   - Yeah.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.280]   - And still kind of can't quite figure out
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.600]   how any of them go mainstream in a way
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.000]   that has any kind of major impact
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.440]   on the way the world works.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.880]   - There is a developer.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.440]   He was the lead developer at ODO.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.320]   He worked at Twitter.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.200]   He worked on Blue Sky.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.720]   His name is Ravel.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.360]   He's gonna be on this week in Google on Wednesday
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.000]   to talk about his new protocol.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.400]   (laughs)
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   So the whole issue to me is you require
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.280]   the network effect to succeed, right?
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.760]   You're not gonna join, look, I want everybody
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.280]   and my family to use signal,
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.760]   but until they do, it's useless, right?
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.000]   Until your family and friends are using
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.760]   a particular protocol,
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.960]   his new Twitter client is called Planetary.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.040]   It's on iOS.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.040]   Not a lot of people using it yet.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.080]   I just don't--
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   - You don't have a protocol.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.400]   Can you have a coin, right?
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.400]   Isn't that--
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.240]   - Yeah.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.200]   - I think people want that new protocol
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.000]   so they can generate value, right?
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   - I think that's right.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.320]   I think that's right.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.080]   Is Blue Sky all tied up in that?
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.880]   You said that there's blockchain.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.280]   Is it kind of also about crypto?
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.360]   - I think, I mean, I think that that sort of door sees,
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.800]   I think it's a little unclear, right?
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.880]   But that is a big driver.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.480]   - If you name his company, Block.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.360]   - Right, I think he's tied up in this.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.240]   He's a Bitcoin, long-time Bitcoin believer.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.520]   I don't know if he's been super clear about it,
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.160]   but I think a lot of this space is also sort of about
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.720]   like hype and coolness and marketing.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.120]   And I think Jack Dorsey has proven, you know,
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:05.960]   he's been to that person.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.320]   - To me, to Matt, that's a non-starter immediately.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.600]   It's like, oh, well, if it's crypto, I'm not gonna do it.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.960]   Is that wrong of me?
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.280]   Is that 'cause I'm a bummer?
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.120]   - I think that's okay.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.000]   I think it's fair to say like you don't want to,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.040]   you don't think that this needs to be financialized.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.400]   Like I think that that's an okay, like trait
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.440]   that you don't like in this.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.320]   I do think there is some like optimism
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.600]   and people trying to do new things,
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.240]   but I do think that a lot of these social networking
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.480]   protocols are often wrapped up.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.360]   Like the Liberty Project is definitely wrapped up
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.080]   sort of in crypto to some extent.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.720]   And I think the Dorsey's thing is too.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.880]   They might not be saying that right now
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.320]   when like, you know, the market's really bad,
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.080]   but I think it's not really cool to be doing like
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.640]   a new NFT thing right now, right?
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.480]   But I think that the underlying--
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.560]   - Oh, it's so uncool.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.600]   (both laughing)
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.280]   - It's really not the vibe for that right now, you know?
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.080]   But I think that they're hoping that, you know,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.920]   it's a winter, right?
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.760]   It's a season.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.600]   It's a crypto winter.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.840]   It's not a crypto forever.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.680]   - Yeah.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.560]   Actually CNN has just gotten in a lot of trouble
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.440]   for what some NFT fans call a rug pull.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.920]   They had their own NFTs.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.240]   They launched last summer,
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.120]   it was called The Vault.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.200]   On Monday, they announced,
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.960]   eh, we decided it's time to say goodbye to The Vault
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:22.960]   by CNN, which is pissing off anybody who bought NFTs
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.840]   from The Vault because now what?
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.200]   They're worthless, right?
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:34.400]   If you're gonna create a speculative security,
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.080]   which I think an NFT is,
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.600]   you better damn well keep it going
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.640]   or people are gonna be pretty upset.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.480]   - That's true.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.520]   That's CNN will have lots of company over the next few months
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.080]   and a couple of years of other folks
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.280]   who jumped on the bandwagon,
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.720]   jumping off of the bandwagon.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.040]   - A few posters on the Discord channel said,
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.320]   they're contacting their lawyers
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.680]   because CNN has done a rug pull
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.640]   leaving people who bought in the NFTs
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.920]   with worthless securities.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.200]   CNN apparently pulled in more than $300,000 from the sale.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.840]   Now I think there are still board apes
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.840]   and owls and very NFTs out there in the world.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.880]   Who was the artist who just burned all his art?
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:30.200]   Saying he's turned it into NFTs.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.320]   And so Damien Hurst burned a thousand paintings
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.000]   and will soon burn more.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.640]   That makes me really sad.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.080]   He released a collection of 10,000 NFTs,
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.000]   each one corresponding to a physical artwork.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.600]   Buyers can keep the NFT,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.520]   in which case the painting will be burned
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.240]   or keep the painting,
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.400]   in which case they'll lose the NFT.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.760]   Which would you rather have?
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:03.640]   - Depends why you bought it.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.680]   If you bought it 'cause you liked the picture,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.040]   then you probably want the painting.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.680]   If you bought it 'cause you thought some sucker,
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.840]   I mean the investor would come along
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.560]   and take it off your hands for twice what you paid for it,
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.440]   then you'd probably want the NFT.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.240]   They were initially priced at $2,000,
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.520]   which is a lot less than apparently
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.000]   Hurst's other paintings have gone for.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.920]   I just, just makes me sad.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.680]   - So crazy.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.640]   - Of course these are pretty fungible paintings
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.920]   that look like just a bunch of colored dots.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.000]   I'm not sure I like the art either, but...
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.000]   - Oh, they all looked like that?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.400]   They're all colored.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.160]   - Oh, I thought they were all different.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.960]   - So, is he an artist or I don't know?
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.640]   - Well, this is, I thought he was burning
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:55.000]   his existing collection,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.680]   but it's like he made something specific for this project.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.360]   I feel like that's less of a stunt.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.280]   He made the postcard.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.520]   If you want the postcard or do you want the NFT?
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.200]   - Yeah, it's a stunt.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.520]   A lot of the stuff around this stuff is a stunt.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.000]   Look, it worked.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.680]   It worked.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.920]   He's claiming he's burning $10 million worth of art.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   Maybe not.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.800]   Maybe it will be worth $10 million
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.200]   when it gets turned into an entity.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.640]   - It's the stunt is part of the art here.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.560]   - Yeah, the stunt is part of the art.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.840]   Yeah, and we gave him the,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.200]   we gave him all the attention he wanted.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.320]   Sorry.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.960]   Oh, let's see.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.120]   Alphabetically.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.960]   Android, Adware, apps.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.640]   There are 16 of these apps in the Google Play Store.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.080]   Nothing you'd probably want to buy,
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.600]   although you might accidentally stumble
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.520]   across currency converter, image vault,
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.560]   joy code, flashlight plus, high speed camera,
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.600]   and buy it or download it.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.480]   Actually, you don't have to buy it.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.080]   Somebody's doing it, 20 million downloads of these
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.040]   and they contain a clicker app.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.000]   Get this.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.160]   This is an interesting kind of scam.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.560]   You might not even know that you've got a clicker app
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.600]   on your Android device.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.680]   It loads ads invisibly.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.760]   In invisible frames or in the background,
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.880]   and then programmatically clicks on them
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.920]   to generate revenue.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.240]   So the real people getting ripped off by this,
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.160]   the people who bought the ads in the first place,
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.280]   they're getting charged for invisible clicks.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.880]   I think this is some degree the dirty little secret
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.440]   of digital is the fake clicks
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.880]   that some say are as much as half of digital ads.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.400]   You're paying for the clicks
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.680]   and half of them are things like this fake.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.960]   All 16 apps are gone.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.280]   Don't go looking for them.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.160]   McAfee reported them.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.120]   But that was after 20 million people installed in the worst.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.400]   DX clean, did you install this?
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.800]   Five million people did.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.720]   Well, a positive rating of 4.1 out of five stars.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.000]   I'm not sure why.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.200]   It was supposedly, this is why.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.400]   'Cause you can't tell if it's really doing anything.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.880]   'Cause it's a system cleaner and optimizer.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.600]   And it seems to be operating better.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.920]   In fact, it's not.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.600]   'Cause it's in the background clicking on,
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.460]   downloading and clicking on ads.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.560]   It's interesting that these apps even get into the store though.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.400]   I mean, a lot of times.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.240]   That's a real question.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.360]   How are they getting, I mean, don't they notice?
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.640]   I mean, even if you're using a web view,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.880]   web browser control, if the code has been scanned
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.360]   by the store to say, oh well,
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.320]   you guys are invisible frames that you're not supposed
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.000]   to be doing that, you're supposed to only be visible
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.600]   with web views, like anything.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.120]   They should have some level of gates to go through
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:54.920]   for these types of things.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.800]   Now if the app, even the app updates itself,
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.120]   it's gotta go through the store.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.080]   Unless you're allowing them to just build
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.840]   a web app frame and then you are still kind of limited
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.640]   in what you can do at the operating system level.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.280]   So I feel like Apple, I mean, not Apple.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.240]   Google needs to do better job here.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.680]   - If they weren't scanning for the stuff,
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.920]   hopefully they are now.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.800]   - I also feel like Google has a little bit
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   of a vested interest in kind of maybe not stopping this stuff,
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.760]   right?
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.280]   I mean, who's probably the number one beneficiary
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.880]   of this is Google?
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.280]   They get more, you know, all those fake clicks
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.800]   end up being money in Google's pockets.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.680]   I don't think Google does everything I can.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.880]   I don't know.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.960]   Or Facebook or any digital seller.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.040]   Do you think they do everything they can to stop click fraud?
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:41.880]   - I don't know.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.840]   - That's a good question.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.640]   I think click fraud in particular is a problem
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.360]   that is probably under appreciated
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.280]   because I think you're right, like what is the incentive?
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:53.080]   It doesn't create as much of bad press.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.280]   Although, you know, there were two times
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.760]   that Facebook got in a lot of trouble
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.360]   when they, that was a separate issue,
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.680]   but that they had mismeasured, you know, the actual impact.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.280]   I think you don't wanna, you know, let it go so crazy
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.600]   that the market is so manipulated
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.960]   that everybody sort of knows that, right?
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.360]   But that kind of is where we've gone with click for arms
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.880]   to some extent, you know, it gets more and more sophisticated.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.040]   But I think App Store approval policies
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.640]   are also sort of a really mysterious
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.760]   and neglected area of reporting.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:24.200]   You know, I think we forget how much of content moderation
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.440]   is happening at that level
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.360]   until there's like, you know, a really prominent app
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.200]   that gets yanked.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.640]   But every day there are just so many approvals and denials
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.960]   for all sorts of apps, you know, for political reasons,
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.440]   for spam reasons that end up getting through or not.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.880]   - Do you think these apps would have gotten
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.960]   through the Apple process?
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.240]   - I think the overall recommendation is, yeah,
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.760]   that Apple is better, I think.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.840]   - Well, we get that impression.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.280]   You say yes, oh, Lou.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.520]   - Yeah, I mean, it'd been through the process.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.440]   They'll, they'll, they take you to the ringer
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.400]   and the reason why a lot of these rules and policies
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.400]   are not visible to you is because they do things
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.400]   behind the scenes and make sure you're not doing anything wrong
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.720]   and they don't want you to know what those are.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.560]   - Right.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:05.000]   We've complained to iHeart Media,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.680]   we've bought ads on iHeart Media Podcast
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.920]   and then we learned that they were buying ads
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.520]   in video games where they would show you 10 seconds
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.040]   or make you listen to 10 seconds of a podcast
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.200]   to get the loot box or whatever.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.240]   And it turns out that counts as a full download
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.600]   of the podcast.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.080]   So, you know, you buy an ad in that podcast,
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.160]   nobody's hearing that ad, you're getting charged for that ad,
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.800]   but all they did was play 10 seconds in a video game.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.480]   That seems a little scummy.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:40.880]   iHeart has reportedly spent $10 million
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.040]   over the last four years producing
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.760]   about six million unique listeners a month
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.160]   from these games.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.320]   We asked them for a comment and a refund
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.920]   and we haven't heard a thing.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.760]   No, just no answer at all.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.920]   No answer at all.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.880]   All right, we're gonna take a little break.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.760]   Apple announced new iPads much to the consternation
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.840]   and confusion of iPad buyers.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.160]   We'll talk about that.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.880]   And where are new M2 MacBooks?
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.200]   That's coming up.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.280]   Louise Misakis is here.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.600]   Tell me about semaphore.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   I'm, this was a big deal when Justin and Ben announced this almost,
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.680]   it's almost feels like six, seven months ago, right?
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.120]   A while ago.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.200]   I think even longer than that.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.320]   I think it's around January.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.120]   And they were cagey about it.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.560]   They didn't say what it was going to be.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.520]   I think it's kind of funny because it's sort of just
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.600]   deceptively simple.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.680]   So people are like, what do you mean?
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.680]   And it's like, well, we're launching a global news platform.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.200]   And I think people sort of laughed at that,
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.680]   but it's the truth.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.160]   I think the idea is hopefully to compete
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.560]   with some of the best global news organizations in the world.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.360]   Like Reuters, like the Wall Street Journal,
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.040]   like Bloomberg, but hopefully do a little bit more
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.800]   to have a more global perspective.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   'Cause I think that those publications are sort of designed
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.320]   for a US audience.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   And we're hoping, for example, like one of the first markets
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.320]   we launched and actually was Sub-Saharan Africa.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.520]   And the current group doing there is like intended to be
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.680]   for Africans, by Africans.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.240]   And I think that is our approach to some extent.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.520]   But yeah, we're breaking down the news article,
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.400]   me and Reid Hoffman.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.800]   - I read Elbowgadi, sorry.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.640]   - I'm like--
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.960]   - I love Reid.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.000]   He was at the Washington Post, right?
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.120]   - From the Washington Post, he's amazing.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.240]   So we're writing a newsletter together.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.640]   - Oh, let me subscribe to that.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.480]   Look at that.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.320]   - Yeah, I can just talk about that.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.160]   - Yeah, please do.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.000]   - Yeah.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.840]   - And so we're writing a newsletter together
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.440]   this week, Reid is amazing.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.040]   He came from the Washington Post where he covered Apple.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.520]   He was at the information for a while.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.360]   - And he wanted to subscribe to all of these.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.200]   (laughs)
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.040]   - He's great.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:54.880]   - We would love that.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.960]   - Yeah.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:56.800]   - Yeah.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.200]   - So I think that's the most important thing
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.800]   for your readers to know is twice a week,
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.960]   you can sort of get our scoops on all things tech.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.720]   And I'm gonna be covering tech in China in particular.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.400]   So if you wanna understand TikTok,
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.520]   if you wanna understand what's going on in Washington
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   with China and tech and with semiconductors
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.680]   and sort of a lot of stuff that's been in the news,
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.040]   it's a good place to just subscribe to them.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.120]   - Really interesting.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.240]   You know, I think there are those who'd say,
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:27.920]   this is the wrong time to start a news service
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.400]   or a new, you certainly wouldn't wanna start a newspaper today.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.240]   Do people even go to websites anymore?
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.400]   I don't know to read the news.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.880]   - I think they do.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.520]   But I think, you know, as a news organization,
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.000]   you just sort of have to think in multiple formats
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   and multiple platforms.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.880]   I think one thing that we're doing differently
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.240]   is that we're doing video from the start
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.280]   and we're actually, we have a video series right now
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.160]   that is partially animated by AI.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.600]   So we're really trying to be innovative.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.120]   - Whoa, I wanna see that.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.480]   So where is that?
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.480]   - It should be on our website
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.000]   and we have put out some,
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.520]   we put out the first episode on Twitter as well.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.800]   It's called Witness and it's sort of about people
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.000]   who are first-hand witnesses to, you know,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.480]   the biggest events happening in the news
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.320]   and we're animating their story with AI,
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.880]   which is really cool.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.240]   So we're trying to be a little bit more innovative.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.400]   It's not just newsletters, you know,
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.760]   but I think that's a big part of our show.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.280]   - I think that's very interesting.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.120]   What are they using?
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.840]   Are they using Dolly too or stable diffusion
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.520]   or mid-journey or all three, do you know?
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.920]   - I believe it's stable diffusion,
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.800]   but I think we're, you know,
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.880]   open to experimentation and seeing what works
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.080]   and what doesn't.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.360]   But I think Dolly too right now is just images,
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.200]   I believe, I don't know how to do it.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.360]   - Yeah, stable diffusion does, we'll do animation.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.120]   - Statement is an intro.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.040]   Come back, we can talk a little bit about stable diffusion
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.360]   because there's a little bit of controversy now
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.680]   going on around it.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:49.680]   I think it's kind of created a Cambrian explosion of AI art,
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.680]   but there are those who say,
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.800]   "Maybe this is not the greatest thing ever."
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.440]   Chiefly, the artists whose art has been scraped
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.800]   by stable diffusion.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.680]   We'll talk about that in a bit.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.920]   Harry McCracken's also here,
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.320]   the technologizer from Fast Company.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.840]   What have you been covering lately?
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.960]   What's your latest beat on Fast Company?
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.800]   - I have a good gig
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.160]   'cause that's a little bit of everything.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.560]   I have a couple of stories coming up.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.080]   I feel like most of them I shouldn't talk about yet,
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.200]   but I do have a cool story which actually ties
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.600]   in a little bit to TikTok
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.600]   and particularly how meta is attempting to compete
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.920]   with TikTok in Instagram and Facebook
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.040]   by not showing you stuff that your friends followed
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.840]   but showing you stuff that in algorithm says,
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.840]   you'll click on which has caused a lot of consternation.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:38.200]   - Yeah, oh, very interesting.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.520]   That will be in our next print issue
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.000]   and also be on the site before too long.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.480]   - Cool, can't wait.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.400]   It's funny, you're very, when I search for your name,
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.040]   the first article I get is something from August 2014.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.320]   My, the iPhone event from 2014, okay.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.120]   - You should be able to find a scrolling list
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.560]   of all my Fast Company stories.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.720]   - It is, but I think it's in reverse chronological order,
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.600]   maybe. - Huh.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.580]   - Huh.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.320]   I don't know what order it's in, it's interesting.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.800]   - Well, we want you to read everything started.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.560]   - Yes, do read it all.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.640]   It's all great. - It's all great.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.640]   It's all great.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:16.160]   And from the Microsoft 365 team,
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.720]   Lou Morezka.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.560]   - That's right.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.800]   - Can I start saying that now, is it?
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.000]   - Sure, why not?
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Why not?
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.680]   - It's still office. - You're not starting saying it, right?
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.720]   - Yeah, it's still office.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.760]   What, so you don't have to answer this,
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.240]   but it feels like Microsoft is moving away
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.000]   from being the Windows and Office company
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.520]   to being the cloud company.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.520]   Like Azure is a big part of what they're doing.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.400]   And I wonder if at some point,
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.960]   Office will just be a cloud platform.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.040]   - I don't think so.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.240]   I mean, my opinion here is,
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.840]   and this is not the companies' opinion, obviously,
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.240]   but my opinion here is there's a lot of users,
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.120]   you know, in different sectors of the market
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.640]   that don't want to use a cloud or web version of a product.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.400]   - Yeah, if you're a lawyer writing pleadings
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.720]   in Microsoft Word, you don't want that to be word for the web.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.080]   - Right, right. - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.760]   - And that's the big advantage over a lot of these other products
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.720]   that are out there like Quip or Google or whatnot,
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.840]   because you can have an offline version of this application
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.680]   that you can feel like secure on your own device.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.120]   - Yeah, I want to ask you about Loop.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.840]   I don't know if you know anything about Loop.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.240]   - I do, yeah, I love Loop.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:26.400]   - Oh, I'm so jealous. - It's not public yet.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.120]   I have lots of questions, so to Paul and Mary Jo.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:34.720]   To me, I feel like Loop, and Google's doing something similar,
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.800]   actually Google did something similar with Wave,
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   which failed, but they're doing something similar with Google Docs.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.480]   Apple, I think, is going to start doing something.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.600]   They have a new kind of whiteboard app
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.240]   that sounds like a little bit like Loop.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.200]   And of course, there's Notion.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.800]   I think there's something kind of bubbling under here
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:53.200]   in a new way of working with documents.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.760]   I want to ask you about that when we come back.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.240]   - Sure.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.240]   - But first, a word from our sponsor, ZipRecruiter.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.960]   Benito, did we hire you through ZipRecruiter?
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.000]   Jason's friend.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.240]   So there's two ways to get a job with Twit.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:13.000]   Be Jason's friend, or through ZipRecruiter.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.880]   So with any workplace, a lot of the people you hire,
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.000]   people who know somebody, who knows somebody,
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.560]   that kind of thing.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.640]   But that's right, 'cause you, yeah,
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.600]   did you work with Jason and CNET?
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.320]   That's why, yeah.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.720]   But when we, for instance, we are beloved continuity person.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.360]   She handled a, wrote the copy,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.920]   she handled all the advertisers, was great.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.280]   She actually decided to go to another company,
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.760]   happens about three months ago.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:42.280]   Lisa's going, "Oh my God, what are we gonna do?"
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.400]   This is a very important person to the company.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.240]   What do we do?
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.080]   We went to ZipRecruiter.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.640]   It's where we always go, to ZipRecruiter.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:49.480]   Posted the job.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.000]   Now one's a great thing about posting a ZipRecruiter
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.480]   as you're casting the widest possible net.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.960]   The thing I always say is, a company is made of people.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.000]   Your company is really just a bunch of people
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.880]   working towards the same goal.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.760]   And hiring a great employee can be transformative.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.480]   It can help you so much.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.000]   Hiring the wrong employee can put you in,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.120]   put the brakes on big time.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.480]   And we've had that experience in both directions.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.920]   So you really become as important.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.200]   Your hiring might be the most important thing.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.120]   A company's leadership, a company's HR division does.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.680]   You're putting together the team
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.040]   that's gonna make you or break you.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.000]   So we take this very seriously.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.600]   And I think anybody who has a company,
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.320]   you have any kind, be a podcast company,
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.240]   but of any kind, should be paying attention
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.640]   to the team you're building.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.440]   Hiring the right people is so important.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.080]   And whether you're hiring for a podcast like we are
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.160]   or for your growing business,
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.880]   ZipRecruiter is the place to go.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.800]   Lisa posted that opening in our continuity department
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.880]   on ZipRecruiter.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.560]   All of the applicants went into the ZipRecruiter interface.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.840]   That's another thing she loves.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.000]   She's not gonna get a lot of phone calls or emails.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   They all go into the ZipRecruiter interface,
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.840]   which means you can easily screen them.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.960]   They reformat all the resumes
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.920]   so that they're easy to scan through.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.880]   They also will give you screening questions.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.720]   Yes, no true, false, multiple choice,
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.000]   even essays that you can use to eliminate people
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:16.960]   who are just not right for the job.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.960]   But then ZipRecruiter does something pretty amazing.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.960]   They go out, they have a million current resumes on file
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.920]   because people come to ZipRecruiter looking for work.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.000]   They go out and look at all those resumes,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.640]   compare their skills with the people you're looking for
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.840]   and then tell you about people who are there
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.200]   who are looking for work and you get to invite them to apply.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.520]   And I have to say, when you invite somebody to apply,
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.880]   they're so excited because they're being invited.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.240]   They're really, they're honored by this.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.200]   They respond, they do the interview, they come in.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.640]   It was an amazing experience.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.000]   Now Viva's on our team, we love her.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.600]   Thank you, ZipRecruiter.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.040]   It's one of the reasons four out of five employers
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.640]   who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.120]   within the first day.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.840]   It's an amazing system.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.960]   So if you love the team that puts together Twit,
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.480]   you will love ZipRecruiter.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.120]   Try it free right now.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.120]   You need to remember our special URL, zipprecruiter.com/twitzipprecruiter.com/twitzipprecruiter.com/twitzipprecruiter.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:24.080]   It is the smartest way to hire.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.000]   And we have constantly been thrilled
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.280]   by how well it's worked for us.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.440]   So many of our staff.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.480]   Really, it either is somebody we know
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.480]   or somebody we got to know very well through ZipRecruiter.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.080]   Okay, back to the alphabetical show.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.360]   We're down to Apple.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.640]   We got American Airlines and Android.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.840]   Now we're on Apple.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.640]   Apple did, I guess did not surprise anybody.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.720]   They did not have an event in October.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.920]   I was sure they were gonna have an event in October.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.000]   I guess it's not too late.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.080]   They could do something next week,
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.760]   but they haven't invited anybody.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.240]   Their quarterly results are Thursday.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.320]   They are releasing, they did announce this week
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.880]   that they're gonna release macOS Ventura
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.520]   and iPadOS 16 tomorrow.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.000]   They also announced new iPads.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.720]   And I love that Jason Snell's take.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.800]   He's not alone.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.920]   Almost everybody has said, what the hell?
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.920]   Jason says the iPad's erratic odyssey continues.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.600]   We'll ask him on Tuesday on a Mac break weekly about this.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   But the problem is they now have kind of a weird mishmosh
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.040]   of iPads.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.120]   In fact, their iPad Pro,
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.840]   which one would think is the top of the line,
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.320]   actually doesn't have some of the features
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   of the 10th generation iPad.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.560]   And the 10th generation iPad doesn't work
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.600]   with the newest pencil and the cameras on the top
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.440]   on the 10th generation, but on the side on the iPad Pro.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.280]   It very much in fact, if you go to the Apple store
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.320]   and you look, it's very confusing.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.400]   What is the Apple?
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.280]   What is the iPad Air?
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.800]   How does that fit in to this lineup?
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   It's just a very confusing carousel of models
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.760]   that don't seem to make a whole lot of sense.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.960]   Harry, I know you like your iPad.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.920]   In fact, you've been in here using an iPad instead of a laptop.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.760]   Are you confused by this lineup?
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.240]   Or does it all make sense to you?
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.960]   And are you gonna get the new iPad Pro
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.040]   perhaps more importantly?
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.040]   - I'm a little confused.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.520]   I mean, after having spent more time thinking about it
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.440]   than most people will or should be expected to do.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.920]   I'm less confused, but it is deliberately cluttered lineup.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:51.720]   I'd say one of the big issues is they now have three iPads
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.520]   which have a screen that's about 11 inches.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.640]   The new 10th generation one,
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.840]   which is it's the successor to the ninth generation one,
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.760]   but because it costs $120 more,
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.840]   the ninth generation one is still on the market.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.880]   Then you have the iPad Air,
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.480]   which is very similar to the 10th generation,
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.480]   except it has a screen that's a little bit better
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.760]   and it has a much better processor, it has the M1.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.800]   And then there's the 11 inch iPad Pro,
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.080]   which has an even better processor
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.400]   and a few other upgrades.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   - It's one beta.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.400]   - But it's the M2.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.360]   - But the look and feel is all basically the same
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.000]   for these three iPads.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.600]   And I think it's at least one iPad at that size.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.880]   It's more than the world needs.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.240]   And you're right, the 10th generation iPad
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.960]   has this thing that iPad Pro users have been asking for
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   forever, which is the webcam being on the landscape.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.880]   - Yeah, 'cause you use it like a laptop.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.840]   - Yeah, as I think most Pro users do.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.760]   So the camera, if it's on the side,
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.440]   it's like to your left.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.640]   - You look all shifty, I didn't.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.480]   - It's weird.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.760]   Yeah, it should be on the top.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.880]   Like is it on one of the most laptops?
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.960]   - Yeah, so Apple finally added that
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.880]   to this relatively inexpensive iPad,
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.160]   but it also really still iPad Pros that don't have that,
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.960]   maybe because it wasn't quite willing this year
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.960]   to invest in like a completely new design for the iPad Pro.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.880]   And then, well, the new iPad has this landscape camera
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.000]   that people have been begging for.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.320]   They got rid of lightning,
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.760]   but they did not allow it to support
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.160]   the second generation Apple Pencil.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.000]   So you need a dongle to charge your first generation iPad
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.400]   Pencil, which still has lightning,
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.240]   which means that if you're out--
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.560]   - That's the weirdest thing.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.880]   - If you're out and about and your pencil dies
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.080]   and you didn't remember to bring a cable
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.280]   and an adapter, you're kind of out of luck.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.480]   - I have the Apple Pencil too, but I long ago
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.040]   I don't know where I've thrown that adapter
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.560]   because I never thought I'd need it.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.040]   And now I need it, right?
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.120]   - So they have this new iPad
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.000]   that's kind of stuck between the old iPad world
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.440]   and the new iPad world in a way that's a little uncomfortable.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.600]   And you've got to hope that maybe they have stuff planned out
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.680]   for next year where some of this will start to make sense
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.880]   and that they're probably all involved
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.280]   pruning the lineup a little bit.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.440]   - I can see why they didn't have an event
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.640]   because that's exactly what everybody would have been doing.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.000]   - Scratching their heads at this event.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.480]   - And answered your question.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.720]   I don't plan to buy this new iPad Pro
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.480]   mainly because it's just not very different.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.640]   It has an even faster processor than the one I have,
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   but lack of computing muscle has not been an issue.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.920]   In fact, I wish that Apple did more to create software.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.000]   They really took advantage of these really fast processors.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.080]   And the one cool thing it has is the second generation pencil
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.440]   and the new iPad Pros has this hover feature
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.400]   where if you hold the pen just above the screen,
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.160]   it can do things like in Apple's Notes app,
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.640]   you'll see a preview of the color and point tip,
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.600]   which is quite handy, but not worth spending
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.040]   a huge amount on, particularly if you kind of feel
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.360]   like maybe next year will be when Apple will do
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.400]   like a more significant Apple Pro upgrade.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.440]   - This has been the number one,
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.000]   complaint's not quite right,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.400]   but the number one issue with the iPad Pro
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.120]   is you've got all this horsepower
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.600]   and you don't have apps to take advantage of it.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.320]   Jason Cell says there's no getting around it.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:22.320]   The absence of Apple's pro media apps on the iPad Pro
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.840]   is an embarrassment.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.360]   All those other apps are great, yes,
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.800]   but Apple has had the opportunity to take the lead
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.120]   in defining what the Pro App experience should be
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.720]   on one of its platforms, the iPad, and as never.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.320]   Sees, it sounds like you agree, Lou.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.960]   - Yeah, I mean, I posted this even on social networking.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.520]   I'm really disappointed in the fact that, you know,
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.800]   they are not putting forth even in their own apps
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.920]   to some of the source bar.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.040]   Now, if you get the iPad 11 one terabyte,
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.600]   you get even more RAM, but that thing is like $14, $1500,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.280]   but you have no software to really take advantage
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.120]   of all that RAM.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.800]   So like, why would people buy it and understand?
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.280]   - Yeah.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.320]   I think Apple was betting big on the stage manager feature,
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.600]   this new multitasking interface,
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.560]   but which officially debuts on Monday,
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560]   and we'll get to see what the masses think about it,
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.920]   but the people have been using the betas.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.640]   I'd say pretty uniformly, at least on Twitter,
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.000]   find it to be like too convoluted and confusing,
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.160]   and it's not even something that'll be turned on by default.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.840]   So I think Apple may be expected that stage manager
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.360]   would wow people, and so far,
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.360]   it does not seem to be wow much of anybody.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.280]   - It seems to be the reason the iPad OS is delayed,
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.440]   iPhone 16 came out last month,
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.160]   is because they couldn't quite get stage manager to work.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.720]   It's gonna come out tomorrow on both iPad OS and Mac OS.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.520]   I use the beta on my iPad Pro,
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.480]   and immediately turned it off.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.080]   It just takes up what is already limited screen space,
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.600]   and doesn't behave in any way predictably.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.040]   It does-- - Stage manager is pretty,
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.200]   yeah, sorry, sorry. - No, go ahead.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.680]   - Stage manager is pretty cool on an external monitor,
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.200]   but that capability has been delayed even further
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.400]   until later this year. - Yes, yes.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.920]   - So I'm not gonna get into the-- - Bigger the screen.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.200]   - Yeah. - The bigger the screen,
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.080]   the more stage manager might kind of make sense,
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.360]   so it is nice an external monitor.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.800]   - Honestly, it's not unusual for Apple to,
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.920]   it happens all the time,
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:20.080]   come up with a new affordance that no one uses,
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.000]   that just kind of doesn't go anywhere.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.120]   And this may, despite all the attention they pay to it,
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.480]   they're trying to do something,
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.720]   and Lou, you work at Microsoft,
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.360]   they're trying to do something that Microsoft
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.240]   has had problems with in the past as well,
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.440]   which is to take a desktop interface
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.200]   and move it to a tablet.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.960]   And famously with Windows 8,
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:47.000]   this was kind of a nightmare hybrid desktop tablet.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.800]   Microsoft backed off by 8.1,
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.000]   and then eventually by Windows 10.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.600]   And actually, now it's pretty, it's very usable,
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.080]   but it was difficult at first, it was a struggle at first.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.280]   - Yeah, I mean, even for building applications,
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.960]   you have to have this kind of hybrid experience,
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.240]   and it's tough to get through that whole,
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.360]   especially developer platform side of things.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.800]   People don't want to build for them,
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.640]   'cause they're kind of newer platforms,
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.200]   and so that's what this will have a problem with,
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.480]   is you're gonna have to have,
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.880]   you're gonna have to get that critical mass
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.840]   on the platform before you see any value for it.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.680]   - Yeah.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.760]   Yeah, and I think maybe stage manager
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.800]   is not the way to handle a multiple.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.400]   I understand they wanna bring desktop-like
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.520]   multi-window experience to iPad,
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.600]   but I don't think stage, for me, stage manager's a big miss.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.360]   I would just, I turn it off immediately and don't ever use it.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.000]   It's just on, also it's unpredictable.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.520]   You don't quite know what's gonna happen.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:45.760]   (laughs)
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.720]   And that's a kiss of death in a computing system.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.880]   If nothing else, you need to be consistent,
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.160]   have consistent results, right?
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.920]   Otherwise, people are just gonna go,
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.960]   I'm confused.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.640]   All right, the biggest, probably the biggest sleeper announcement
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.280]   of this week was a new Apple TV.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.760]   And maybe more important than the fact
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.840]   that they're new Apple TVs,
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.480]   that they're dropping the price significantly.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.760]   This is one of the things that kept the Apple TV
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.120]   from competing well with Roku and the Fire TV,
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.520]   was it was a $200 streaming device.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.520]   Now it starts at $129,
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.020]   and if you want ethernet,
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:28.900]   and a little bit of an updated chip experience, $149.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.280]   That's a lot, that's 50 bucks less.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.100]   You get 64 gigs and Wi-Fi only for $129,
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.100]   which is probably what most people are gonna get.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:43.100]   Still like three times more than a Roku, but not 200 bucks.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:48.260]   And 128 gigs for 20 bucks more with an ethernet port
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.940]   and support for thread, which is Apple's,
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:53.740]   actually it's Google's interface for home automation,
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:56.320]   but Apple's supporting it in their home kit.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.740]   I don't know, is this,
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:04.260]   it's Apple famously five years ago said Apple TV's just a hobby.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:08.360]   They have not convinced me otherwise, even today.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.700]   It just feels like an afterthought.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.700]   Louise, do you cover Apple at all?
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.820]   Do you use Apple products at all?
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.380]   I don't wanna leave you out.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:20.140]   - But I think, you know,
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.120]   this is just all part of a bigger,
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.460]   pivot services, right?
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.340]   Like I think they want you to have the Apple TV
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.700]   and they want you to watch their content.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:33.100]   I think a lot of the device experiments
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.580]   that Apple is doing right now are sort of secondary to that,
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.420]   right?
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:38.620]   They want to make services bigger,
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:39.460]   they wanna make advertising.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.540]   - Oh, that's interesting, yeah.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.380]   - My thought is like,
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.020]   I just think they have this weird iPad line
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:44.860]   because like they're like,
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.100]   well, we gotta put out another device,
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.780]   but I think that they're sort of realizing that people,
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.340]   you know, they're hitting that barrier, right?
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.160]   Of like how much they can make the next iPad different
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.360]   when the iPad before that,
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.400]   so they need differentiates.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.440]   - Yeah, it's barely different, that's right.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.880]   They may be having the same problem with Macs.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.160]   It's not unusual for them in the Mac books in November.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.400]   Of course, the closer you get to the holidays,
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:11.000]   you know, the more opportunities you miss,
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.600]   it is expected that we'll announce M2 MacBook Pros
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.800]   and maybe an M2 Mac Mini,
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.120]   but it won't be this month.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.800]   I think even Mark German says,
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.560]   probably gonna be next month.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.300]   And maybe again, by press release,
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.420]   which to me always feels like that's a company
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:30.060]   that's not really proud of what its next product is.
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.020]   - I'd say Apple, yeah.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.380]   - Yeah, I mean, Apple has a unique ability
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:38.100]   to get the eyeballs of not just the press,
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:43.100]   but of users within a few hours,
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.780]   they already had half a million views
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.020]   on their iPad announcement.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.380]   I mean, people on YouTube,
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.180]   people immediately, in fact, I bet it's more than that now,
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:54.620]   people care and I think when Apple can have an event,
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.020]   they probably should just because it's an hour ad,
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.380]   it's a free ad.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.380]   Let me just see, meet the new iPad.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.940]   Yeah, 8.6 million views in five.
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:05.740]   Oh, let me stop, I can't play it
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.820]   because they pulled us off of YouTube for playing this.
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:12.500]   Hi, hi, you gotta.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.820]   (laughing)
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.360]   What the hell is that all about?
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.860]   Don't pull us off, I didn't play it.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:20.860]   I just, it started, it was my, I didn't mean to.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.700]   Please Apple, forgive us.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:25.300]   We iOS today played this video,
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:29.020]   which is a nine minute ad for the new iPads, right?
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:32.660]   They played this video and immediately got taken off YouTube.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:33.500]   Pull down.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:39.380]   Mac break weekly, I didn't know that,
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:42.900]   so I put the, I use this to illustrate the new product.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.760]   Don't show it.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.500]   Don't press that button, Benito.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.420]   And I got, immediately I got from the editors,
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.780]   is oh, we got pulled down, you gotta take it out.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.740]   So I got, so if you watched, by the way,
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.980]   it's only the YouTube edition of the show.
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:00.540]   If you subscribe on the podcast,
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.220]   you'll get the full version of the show,
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:04.140]   'cause it's my opinion, this is a news show.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.580]   We're showing Apple promotional,
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.060]   I don't see why they wouldn't want us to put it in there,
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.140]   but I can't get pulled down from YouTube,
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.780]   takes too long to appeal and get it back up,
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:17.060]   and it's just not worth the effort, so don't show it.
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:18.060]   I don't need this, I don't need it,
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.860]   but they got 8.6 million views in the last five days on this.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.580]   So I guess maybe they don't have to do an event, I guess.
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.780]   - One interesting thing about the Apple TV
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.900]   is that the remote has USB-C instead of lightning.
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:31.740]   - Yeah.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.300]   - It might be a tiny bit of evidence that they do, in fact,
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.020]   tend to wind down lightning over the next year or so.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.820]   Obviously the big deal would be if they put USB-C
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.820]   in an iPhone, but you also still have all those people
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.300]   with AirPods out there that are based on lightning.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.860]   And that would kind of be the litmus test
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:53.380]   if you see AirPods that are USB-C based,
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.060]   which I imagine they might do simultaneously
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.620]   with an iPhone just to simplify people's lives.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.860]   - It is the beginning of the end for lightning, isn't it?
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:05.220]   In fact, the EU has, in effect, declared it's the beginning
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.460]   of the end for lightning because by next year,
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:11.140]   not for an iPhone 15, by the end of next year,
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:14.340]   you can't sell anything that doesn't have a USB-C
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.740]   charging interface.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.900]   So all of Apple's products will be have to be converted
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.700]   by the end of next year.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.940]   That's probably aligns with what they had already planned
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.180]   to do, I would guess.
[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:27.140]   Apple is also, and this will be interesting
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.380]   to see how people react.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.300]   This is gonna put more ads on the app store,
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.220]   starting next week.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:35.180]   They send an email to developers saying,
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:39.060]   "Would you like to buy an ad in the main to date tab,
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.420]   which has never had ads before,
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:45.020]   or in a, you might also like section
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:48.140]   at the bottom of individual app listings.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:52.060]   In all countries except China, no ads for you, China.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:57.260]   The ads will have a blue background and an ad icon,
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:01.340]   so we'll have to wait and see how much they look like,
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.660]   how clearly they are ads.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:07.620]   I guess there's an example from Mac Rumors.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:12.620]   So you're looking at travel day, you're seeing other apps,
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.580]   and then maybe this is an Apple provided.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.060]   I bet this is, this is an Apple provided image,
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.300]   'cause these are fake apps.
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.540]   And then there's TripTrack,
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.700]   and you see it's a blue background instead of the white,
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.140]   and it says, "Add" in the blue button.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:28.020]   There's similarly, here's the same ad for TripTrack
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.540]   on the today page.
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.820]   It says, "Add TripTrack."
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.820]   Does this undermine Apple's contention
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:37.540]   that they don't spy on you, they're secure,
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.180]   they're private, they don't care?
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.940]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.020]   - Go ahead, Luis.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.500]   - I would say every app store is doing this,
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.420]   though, I think it allows you to bootstrap your application.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:49.740]   - It's great for developers.
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:50.580]   - Yeah.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:51.700]   - I'm sure makes a big difference.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.340]   I know for podcasts,
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:58.100]   if we get on the editorial part of the podcast page,
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.260]   the doubles, the downloads for that episode.
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:02.940]   So it's huge, I'm sure for the same thing for apps.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.980]   Luis, what were you gonna say?
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:08.580]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that you're seeing this sort of
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:12.300]   rise of other big tech companies,
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.540]   aside from sort of the ad giants,
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.940]   as we like to think of them,
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:19.100]   turning to advertising is a really lucrative new
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.020]   revenue stream, right?
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.620]   Amazon is doing this increasingly.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:24.300]   Amazon's ad business is now larger than YouTube's.
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.420]   Apple is doing this, Uber announced this week
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.580]   that they are also gonna start introducing ads,
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.860]   you know, during your ride.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:33.620]   They'll be ads while you're waiting for your ride,
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.540]   and those are gonna be based on where you're going
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.300]   and where you're coming from.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.500]   So I think that these are all businesses
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.060]   that we don't traditionally associate
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.060]   with advertising, but, you know, they're all doing it.
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.740]   - And the thing that we've always said,
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:50.660]   and maybe it's not quite as clear to the general public,
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:55.660]   is that Apple, by kind of banning third party tracking,
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:00.740]   is in a way favoring its own first party tracking.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.900]   They can say, "Well, these apps, they can't track you,
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.100]   "but our apps, we can track you."
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.140]   We can, we can, Apple, Google, Facebook,
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.220]   Amazon all have first party information
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:13.860]   that's probably more than sufficient to sell ads.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:16.860]   So in a way, they're self-dealing a little bit
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.500]   by saying, "Well, you know, no one else can track you
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.180]   "on the iPhone, but don't worry, we got this.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.180]   "Oh, my beer."
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:27.540]   - My big beef with ads in the App Store
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.380]   is not privacy so much as the fact
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:33.660]   that App Store Search is really still marginal,
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:35.620]   or even sometimes downright terrible.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:38.020]   - It could be quite hard to find the app you're looking for,
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.020]   even if you're searching for its exact name,
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.820]   it may not show up top, and certainly a lot of cases,
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.100]   other apps are buying,
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:49.260]   the app you were looking for, so they show up first,
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.700]   and if you're lucky, like four or five apps down,
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.180]   you might find the app you were looking for
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:55.820]   in the first place, and if Apple just did a better job
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:58.340]   of improving its core search algorithm,
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.700]   this wouldn't be so annoying.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.340]   - I wonder how much that affects apps and app developers,
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:06.860]   the fact that you can say, you can do buy
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.100]   and add somewhere else for your app,
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.140]   but people can't find it, and end up using your competitor.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.820]   In fact, Florian Mueller, who runs the Fospatence blog,
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:18.820]   said that exactly, said, "This is another means
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.220]   "of increasing the effective app tax rate
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:26.220]   "forcing developers to buy ads on their own app pages
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:31.220]   "in order to avoid competitors stealing customers."
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.300]   - Totally, people also game the system by the,
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.580]   I was searching for Procreate on my iPad,
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:39.300]   and you know, kind of the defining painting app,
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.460]   and there was like another app that was not Procreate,
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:45.740]   but they squeezed Procreate into their little text field
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.020]   for the name of their app, so that showed up really high,
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.460]   even though it is absolutely nothing to do with Procreate.
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:52.940]   - Yeah, that's terrible.
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:56.180]   And speaking as a user, you know, you may say,
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.580]   "Well, I don't care, but as a user, this is bad for you
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.940]   "because if you're a free app, and you're trying to get people
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:05.100]   "to download your app, and your app page is loaded
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:08.300]   "with ads for other people's apps,
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.100]   "and you have to buy that space
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:12.700]   "so that you don't get the competitors."
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.380]   Suddenly, there's a strong incentive
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:15.660]   to start charging for your app.
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:17.660]   You need to make more money now,
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.580]   and that's not good, I think, for the app ecosystem.
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:23.140]   - Absolutely.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.740]   - Yeah, I think the interesting thing is they try
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.140]   to train you and you build, put your app in the app store
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.580]   to do SEO, to be able to say, "Hey, this is how you get
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.900]   "yourself more people to find you."
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.060]   You put more keywords, you use the right keywords,
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:37.740]   or so on and so forth, but most apps don't do it right
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.740]   because it's not a very clear, like they were saying,
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:44.700]   that it's not a clear algorithm, so it's unfortunate.
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:50.580]   - Apple Design Chief, Evans Hanky is leaving.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:55.540]   She took over when Johnny left three years later.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:58.260]   She's on the way out the door.
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:01.180]   That's a big deal because there's no one right now
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.460]   to run Apple's design, and Apple,
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:06.820]   which was famous for its design for so long,
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:11.540]   is sitting without a VP of Industrial Design.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:15.420]   She will leave, she announced in the next six months,
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.540]   so I imagine they will find a replacement,
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.740]   but here's an important person.
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:22.260]   This is somebody who, whoops, stop, stop.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:27.260]   This is somebody who was, you know, Johnny Ives' right hand
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:32.980]   and certainly understands and knows Johnny's design ethos.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:38.820]   Is this a big deal, Harry, for Apple to lose Evans Hanky,
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:43.500]   so quickly after losing Johnny Ives?
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.420]   - Yeah, I mean, particularly given that it's Apple,
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:48.140]   and I think we're still coming to understand
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:51.540]   what the post-ive era of Apple design is.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.500]   I mean, there've been some hints, such as the fact
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.660]   that they brought out new MacBook Pros
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.660]   that were thicker and heavier.
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:58.500]   - Yes.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.180]   - That had had had had had had had had had had
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.780]   - Of course. - People missed.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.540]   They brought back all the ports, so.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.340]   We've seen, I think, in a pretty healthy way,
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:09.660]   them lose some of Johnny Ives' obsessions,
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.860]   and whether they're, you know,
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.940]   which they did basically by undoing past moves,
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.820]   but the next question is, once you stop
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.460]   maybe correcting past mistakes,
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:23.700]   how do you actively make these products better?
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.460]   And I don't think we've seen enough Apple products yet
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:29.860]   to understand exactly where the company is going,
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.620]   you know, given that the products they're shipping today
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.100]   have been in the works for a long time,
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.940]   and Johnny Ives will have an influence,
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:41.260]   probably on every Apple product ever made forever,
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.620]   but I am very intrigued by him.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.700]   Signs that they won't just be,
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:49.580]   what would Johnny have done as the guiding light,
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.580]   and with Hankie leaving,
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.700]   it might be even a little bit longer
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:55.820]   before we fully understand what the direction is.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.340]   - I have to say, I mean,
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.660]   I just have kind of liked the direction since Johnny left.
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:04.860]   I don't mind thicker, heavier, better battery life,
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:07.380]   more ports, that's just more functional.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:11.700]   I think Johnny maybe pushed it a little too far
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:15.860]   in the form over function.
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.340]   - Magsafe is back, which is a lot of people.
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:24.580]   Okay, I think that was our Apple segment.
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.660]   (laughs)
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:30.980]   There'll be lots more Apple coverage on Tuesday
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:32.100]   with Mac Break Weekly.
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.340]   In fact, Jason Snow will be back,
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.260]   we'll ask him about what he thinks of the iPad lineup.
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:40.020]   He says it's confusing, I think it's sort of,
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:43.580]   well, there's one more kind of related Apple story.
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:45.660]   Apple was one of the companies,
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:46.620]   one of the big tech companies,
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:50.460]   built bidding for the NFL Sunday ticket.
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.220]   That's still up for grabs.
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.580]   Sunday ticket is the last NFL property
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:59.940]   that has not been sewn up contractually through 2030.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:01.620]   So all the other stuff is sold.
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:05.380]   The Sunday ticket was a direct TV exclusive.
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:09.700]   They paid one and a half billion dollars a year for that.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.460]   Lost, it has said a lot of money on it.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.820]   In fact, towards the end, direct TV was just giving it away
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:18.220]   'cause they couldn't get anybody to pay for it.
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.900]   Now the NFL wants more like two to two and a half billion
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:24.260]   dollars a year, which of course,
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.860]   eliminated direct TV from the bidding
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:28.780]   and really brought in the big tech company.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:31.980]   So Amazon, Disney Plus, and Apple,
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.100]   I imagine Google is probably in there as well.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:40.020]   This is a great way to promote your product.
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:43.140]   And as you were saying, with Apple caring more about services,
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:48.380]   this is a way to get people to subscribe to Apple TV.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:51.020]   To buy an Apple TV and to subscribe to Apple TV Plus.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:57.180]   But to hang up apparently, and this is kind of interesting,
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:02.540]   is over what they can do with the broadcast rights.
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.860]   The NFL is traditionally very restrictive
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.060]   about what the games can look like,
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.780]   how you broadcast them, what you can do with them.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:12.740]   Apple, according to Eddy Q, isn't just interested
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:15.580]   in being a conduit for broadcast games.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:21.260]   As they've done with Major League Soccer,
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:25.460]   Creator Relationship was allows them to do more with the games.
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.180]   We aren't interested, said at EQ this week,
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:32.300]   at a Paley Center for Media Panel in New York.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.140]   We aren't interested in buying sports rights.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.620]   There's all kinds of capabilities
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.020]   that we're going to be able to do together
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.380]   because we have everything together.
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:42.740]   And so if I have a great idea,
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:46.300]   I don't have to think about, oh, okay, well, my contract,
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.580]   or the deal of interest will or won't allow this.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.180]   NFL does not lie.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:55.020]   NFL is not going to lie down like Major League Soccer
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:56.780]   is going to lie down.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.460]   Lou, are you a football fan?
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.500]   Oh, yeah, big one, big one.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.300]   And I think, I know a lot of people work for Amazon,
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:06.620]   they actually work on Amazon's streaming support services.
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.700]   They got Thursday night football exclusively.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.060]   They really want this.
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.740]   They really want this because they can support,
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:15.260]   they can support all the tack on services
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:17.980]   and the experience that they want their users to have,
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.300]   and they want people to see that.
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.260]   And so they're really pushing really hard for this.
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.540]   - So when I saw that,
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:24.900]   Amazon's Thursday night football,
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.660]   the only way you can get it is by having
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:28.420]   a streaming subscription.
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:31.780]   You have to have an Amazon Prime and stream it, right?
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.500]   You can't watch it on broadcast television
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.540]   unless it's in it, you're in there,
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.580]   getting the market of the game.
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:40.220]   So I thought that's got a hurt ratings.
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:43.700]   But I guess everybody has an Amazon Prime account,
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.340]   I guess, and a Fire TV stick, I don't know.
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.580]   They did, they went out and they got
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.460]   two of the best announcers in the business, Kirk Herb Street,
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:54.460]   or is it Herb Kirk Street?
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:57.020]   I can never, I can fuse him.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.820]   And Al Michaels, who's a legend in the business.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:01.620]   And I think they're actually doing a pretty good job,
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.420]   but they also offer like three different ways to watch it.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:08.620]   You can watch it with the regular broadcasters,
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:11.660]   you can watch it with some with like, I don't know,
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:13.620]   this is the new thing now.
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:16.660]   The Super Bowl was co-branded with Nickelodeon,
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:19.460]   and you're watching the Nickelodeon version of the Super Bowl.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.500]   I can't remember what Amazon's doing,
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.940]   it's like Deezus and Mirro or somebody doing the play-by-play.
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.140]   Maybe it's the Peyton Brothers, the Manning Brothers.
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:29.820]   And then they have a third version,
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.860]   which I tried to watch, which is the Amazon Stats version.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:35.420]   The only reason I stopped watching is
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:36.980]   'cause everything is a bird's eye view,
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.860]   so they can do all these lines and squiggles
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:42.540]   during the game of where this guy ran,
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.580]   and it's kind of cool, but I wanted,
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.540]   I wanted the normal shot.
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.980]   I like the close-ups and stuff like that.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.460]   But clearly they've got a free reign to play with this
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:53.300]   a little bit.
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:57.620]   Plus the league knows them.
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.500]   So they might have an inside track.
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:03.580]   This would be very, very expensive.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:07.020]   You think Amazon has two and a half billion to pay a year?
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:07.860]   I guess so.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.220]   - I think so, it's in their back pocket.
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.820]   - Exactly, they can find it somewhere.
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.460]   This is a US-only product, by the way.
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.420]   So maybe Apple wants to do it globally?
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:22.340]   I don't know, I mean the NFL does have global ambitions.
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:25.620]   That's why they have games in London every year.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:29.460]   Two to $3 billion a year,
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:32.540]   which is a massive increase from what DirecTV was paying.
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:35.420]   I think it's gonna be really interesting
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:37.180]   to see what Apple does with Major League Soccer.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:40.900]   Soccer's had a hard time getting traction in the US.
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:43.380]   They've got a 10-year deal with MLS.
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:46.660]   And if I hope they do something more than they do with baseball,
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:49.740]   Apple does Friday night baseball and it's just not great.
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:51.300]   But if they could do something interesting,
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.340]   I mean 4K would be just a starting point,
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.580]   but maybe something graphically more interesting.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.100]   I don't know, I don't know.
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:59.380]   It seems like there's opportunities here.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:01.060]   If the NFL lets them.
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:05.420]   Louise, Harry, you got anything to say about this?
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.580]   Or should we move on?
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:09.860]   Not a thing, not a word.
[01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:11.180]   - I'm not a big football person,
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:16.180]   so I am looking at it from a subjective viewpoint.
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:20.420]   I did do a big story about a few years ago
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:23.660]   when Twitter was getting very into live broadcasting of sports
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.700]   and that was supposed to change what Twitter was to people
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.860]   and it seems to have had little or no effect
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.660]   on what people wanted Twitter to do.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.820]   - So interesting.
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:35.260]   They've tried to throw so many things against the wall.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:39.100]   - At least Amazon and Apple are coming to them
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:42.780]   for live streaming up stuff, so it makes more sense.
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:47.540]   - Does Twitter does live audio now, right?
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:48.620]   - Twitter spaces.
[01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:51.460]   - Twitter spaces, is that taking off?
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.660]   They're trying to be basically,
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:55.380]   this is, they saw a block party take off.
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.900]   They said we could do that.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.220]   And then of course-- - Clubhouse.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:00.700]   - Clubhouse, not block party, clubhouse, thank you.
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.060]   And then clubhouse, where's clubhouse now?
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.860]   - Nowhere, I think it was so strange to me
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:09.220]   how much clubhouse took off and how much people
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:10.900]   thought live audio was the future
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.900]   because it reminded me of the worst call-in radio show
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.460]   you've ever heard. - Exactly.
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:19.420]   - Not being moderated at all.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:22.420]   And so, who thought that that was a good,
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.260]   I don't know, it was just strange to me,
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:26.420]   you can't not produce content.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:28.900]   Good content is a hard thing to do.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:31.060]   I think people were just really bored during the pandemic
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.420]   and it was sort of novel at first
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:35.340]   because really high profile people were on there
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.140]   and you sort of got them unfilled right.
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:42.220]   - I did, so the local radio station,
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:44.780]   News Talk, Radio Station in San Francisco
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:48.660]   was summarily executed two weeks ago, KGO.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.580]   And there was a dominant station in not just the Bay Area,
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.260]   but nationally.
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:56.820]   And Cumulus, which is one of the three big radio companies
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:00.180]   in America, bought them 10 years ago,
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:02.540]   messed 'em up, messed 'em up, messed 'em up.
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:05.100]   Finally, they just pulled the plug last week
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:09.620]   and turned it into a sports gambling station,
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:13.900]   which is hysterical because part of the reason they did that,
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.900]   I think is because there is a proposition on the ballot
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:20.260]   in California to make sports betting legal
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:24.500]   and it is currently losing two to one in the polls.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:27.100]   So they may have switched formats prematurely
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.540]   and improperly, but anyway,
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.780]   that's the only time I ever listened to two new spaces,
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.860]   all the hosts who got laid off said,
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:36.300]   "Well, what do we do? Talk radio?
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:37.580]   Oh, we could do Twitter spaces."
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:40.260]   So they did like a three hour Twitter spaces,
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:42.580]   which no, you know, 100 people listened to
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:44.420]   and then that was that.
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:46.980]   It's where talk show hosts go to die.
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:49.740]   Let's, maybe that's what it is, I don't know.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.580]   Let's take a little break.
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.660]   We have a few more things to talk about
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.700]   with our esteemed panel,
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:56.660]   the technologizer, Harry McCracken,
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:59.300]   Lou Morezka from this week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:02.580]   Louise Mazzakis, who is now,
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:06.020]   I'm so happy, Tech reporter at Semaphore.
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:09.060]   Great place, I'm rooting for you.
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:11.060]   Great to have all three of you on the show today,
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:14.860]   are show today brought to you by Shopify.
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:15.700]   (bell dings)
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.700]   Yeah, Shopify, are you finding sales sluggish
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:21.620]   this quarter, oh, yay, yay.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:25.340]   Discover Shopify, the all in one commerce platform

[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:36.620]   I know this firsthand because my daughter
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:40.380]   has a Shopify site selling t-shirts she designed.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:44.860]   And Shopify makes it so easy to set up a site,

[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:07.300]   I remember what she was doing it.

[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.060]   to successfully grow your business
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:21.860]   from an in-person point of sale system

[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:26.860]   even on social media platforms like TikTok,
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:29.580]   Facebook, Instagram, I actually have to ask my son.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:33.220]   I think he is, he should Shopify for his site.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:37.260]   Thanks to 24/7 support and free on demand business courses,
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:41.780]   Shopify is here to help you succeed every step of the way.

[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:48.620]   That's really a nice feeling, that first sale.

[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:09.100]   you can with Shopify, truly global,

[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:20.220]   I think Shopify is the most democratizing of sites.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:26.060]   Yeah, salt hank powered by Shopify.
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:26.900]   Look at that.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.140]   And he can take Amex, Apple Pay,
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:34.140]   Diners Club Discover, Meta, Google Pay, MasterCard,
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:36.620]   PayPal, Venmo and Visa.
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:39.740]   And you know what, he didn't have to do anything to get that.
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.460]   It all just comes with the Shopify platform.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.140]   And now Hank's expanding.
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:46.380]   He's got other things he's gonna start selling
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:47.580]   in Hank's kitchen.
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.780]   I think that's kinda cool.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:53.020]   I didn't even really realize this, both my kids
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:54.740]   are using Shopify.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:55.580]   Isn't that great?

[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:11.300]   if I can do Apple Pay or Amazon Pay or Google Pay,
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.980]   big plus, right?
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:14.740]   It just makes it so much easier.
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:17.340]   And there's a sense of trust as well, right?
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:20.220]   Grow your business anywhere.

[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.420]   I didn't even think of the fact both my kids now

[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:19.420]   That's pretty cool.

[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:26.660]   but we did have a very fun week on Twitch.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:29.420]   So much fun that we decided to make you a little movie
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:30.740]   all about it.
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.060]   Kello Scott.
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:33.300]   Hello, Micah.
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.620]   Welcome to the big chair.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:35.580]   Oh, thank you very much.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:36.940]   The big ball, actually.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.020]   The big ball.
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.340]   I have sat upon that ball myself,
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:41.940]   and it's quite the thing.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.420]   I wanna fix his desk.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:45.260]   I gotta tell you, there's this drawer
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.900]   that just doesn't close right.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:48.180]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:49.220]   You bang your knees.
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:50.060]   Yes.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.380]   (laughing)
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:54.060]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.260]   All about Android.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.580]   We've got Flows Pixel 7 review.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.980]   That's the 7 and the 7 Pro.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:03.660]   Flows also reviews the Pixel Watch.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:05.580]   So you get a full review about this?
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:07.020]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:09.180]   So let's talk about these iPads here.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:11.740]   They did so much to make this inexpensive,
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:14.060]   like $450 tablet into,
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:15.340]   why would you, why on earth
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:17.540]   would you even consider buying a Windows tablet?
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:20.940]   This is such a compelling product in so many ways.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.220]   Security now.
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:24.940]   This simple and straightforward,
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.620]   yet ineffective mode and method of encryption
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:32.780]   is known as electronic code book or ECB.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:36.500]   The most famous and clear example of the failure
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:39.260]   of electronic code book mode
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:43.340]   to effectively protect the secrecy of data
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:46.740]   is the classic demonstration of the image
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:49.900]   of the Linux Penguin.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:50.740]   And what is--
[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:52.700]   How could they even call that encryption?
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.540]   Exactly.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:54.900]   I mean, I know.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.220]   It's not encryption.
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:57.220]   Twit.
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:58.880]   Some assembly required.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.420]   All right, before we get back to the show,
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:04.660]   I wanna do a little plug for Club Twit
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:06.260]   'cause it's so important to us these days.
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:09.580]   Maybe you noticed not as many ads.
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:11.660]   That's gonna get worse over time.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:13.220]   Economy's going bad.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.740]   And podcast advertising is,
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.580]   I'm afraid going south.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:18.420]   That's why the club,
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:20.060]   but that's why we started the club in the first place
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.980]   and that's why it's so important to us.
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.940]   And I think it's the best deal in podcasting.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:27.340]   So what do you get as a member of Club Twit?
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:30.140]   You get ad-free versions of every show that we do.
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:31.460]   Every single show.
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:33.900]   Not just shows you can get with ads
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.580]   and it shows you can't get as,
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:37.060]   if you're not a member,
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.180]   Hands-On Macintosh with Mike Asargent,
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:40.940]   Paul Therat's Hands-On Windows,
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:43.780]   the Untitled Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett,
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:45.540]   the Gizfiz with Dick D. Bartolo.
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.860]   These are all shows we don't publish publicly.
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.740]   They're only available to club members.
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:51.740]   They're part of the Twit Plus feed,
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:54.900]   but there's another reason why you might wanna take a look
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:56.340]   at Twit.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:59.100]   Club Twit is the Club Twit Discord,
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:02.740]   which is an absolute joy.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.860]   If you've not been in there,
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:05.740]   I think it's so much fun.
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:07.980]   Every show, of course, has a section.
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:10.020]   We have chat, just like we do with IRC,
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:15.020]   we have chat going on in the Club Twit section.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:19.700]   But we also have sections for beer, for autos,
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:23.380]   for anything geeks are into comic books, coding.
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.580]   So it's a really great social,
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.740]   I think it's a future social media.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:29.660]   And because it's Club Twit members only,
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:32.020]   they're like-minded people, quality.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:36.020]   They're full of animated gifts.
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:39.580]   It is a really wonderful place to hang out.
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:42.140]   So you get ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:44.220]   You get shows you can't get anywhere else.
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:46.180]   You get access to Club Twit.
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:48.140]   And all of that, how much would you pay?
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:50.540]   Seven bucks a month, that's all.
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:52.060]   Just seven bucks a month.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:54.580]   But it sounds like it's not a lot.
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.860]   People have told us we should charge more.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:01.140]   I wanted to make it accessible and fair to everybody.
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:04.140]   But it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:05.620]   It helps us keep the lights on.
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:07.460]   So if you're not a member of Club Twit,
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:12.460]   may I humbly, I guess is the word, humbly,
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:16.220]   entreat you to at least consider it.
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.620]   And it's a great gift for a geek in your life.
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:20.260]   It's also great for businesses.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:23.100]   We have a number of business members.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:26.340]   In fact, we just, I think, sold another business subscription.
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:27.820]   Really appreciate that.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.220]   There is a yearly plan, but it doesn't cost any less.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.380]   It's just seven times 12.
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:35.100]   But just, so you don't have a charge every month.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:38.100]   I really appreciate your consideration.
[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:42.020]   twit.tv/club, club twit.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:44.300]   Thank you very much for your consideration.
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:49.180]   If you are on a Boeing 787,
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:53.260]   you might wanna ask when they've rebooted last.
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:57.940]   Boeing, it's a weird thing,
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:00.980]   but Boeing 787s have to be turned off and on
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:05.980]   once every 51 days, or they will show misleading data
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.620]   to pilots.
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:13.220]   It's potentially catastrophic if the reboot directive,
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:14.940]   but it's a computer, right?
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:19.620]   You can have the onboard network switches crash.
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:22.860]   You can have inaccurate data,
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:26.100]   including airspeed, altitude, attitude, engine operating
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.860]   and other instructions.
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:30.180]   In addition to that, the stall warning horn
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:32.860]   and overspeed horn, stop working.
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:35.300]   (laughs)
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:36.980]   That seems like a bug, Lou.
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:41.020]   You said, "Is that seems like a bug?"
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:42.420]   Seems like a bug.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:45.020]   The worst part about this, I know I used to live next to a guy
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.740]   who worked at Boeing, in fact, on these units,
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:49.860]   and they go through so much rigor.
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:52.820]   I just can't understand how they deliver something like this.
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:55.740]   They didn't let it sit for 51 days, clearly.
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.580]   (laughs)
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:58.860]   And you know this, software testing is hard
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:02.100]   because you can't test for every possible thing.
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.020]   And one thing they, I guess, must be a memory leak, right?
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:09.180]   That doesn't, you know, that takes 51 days.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:10.820]   I'm just, I don't know.
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:11.660]   I don't know.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:17.140]   Now this is an article from the Register.
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:20.860]   The Register says, "Based on the airworthiness directive,
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:24.980]   the power cycling is needed to prevent stale data
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:28.260]   from populating the aircraft's systems."
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:33.260]   That sounds like a layman describing a memory leak to me, right?
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:36.740]   It's filling up, and there's no room for the new data,
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:40.980]   so you're getting old data because you've filled up the space.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:46.220]   Can we fix this by not using C++?
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:47.700]   Is that the simple fix?
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.620]   (laughs)
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:51.460]   - It's never as easy as that, unfortunately.
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:52.860]   - I wish it were.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:54.780]   A true garbage collected language.
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:56.220]   You wouldn't have to worry about it.
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.180]   Use TypeScript, right?
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:44:59.020]   - That's right.
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:44:59.860]   - Yes, that's the solution.
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.220]   - Hey, who's guy is TypeScript, right?
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.740]   - Is it really good?
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:03.780]   TypeScript's great.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:07.340]   TypeScript does Microsoft's take on Java.
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:08.700]   Is it purely functional?
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:10.020]   I think it's functional.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:13.500]   - Oh yeah, it's a Turing that supported everything.
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:14.660]   - How's F# doing?
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.380]   That was also the functional version of C#.
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:18.820]   Is that doing all right?
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:20.300]   - Still going strong.
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.740]   - See if you have functional software,
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.020]   you don't have this problem.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:27.060]   - You don't have this problem.
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:27.900]   - You have other problems.
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:28.900]   - You have other issues.
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:30.500]   (laughs)
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.420]   You have infinite recursion.
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:34.620]   But that's another problem.
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:38.720]   This is the week that hearing aids went over the counter.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:44.180]   Easier, faster and cheaper, you can buy in theory,
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:46.220]   hearing aids at a drug store
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:49.020]   without an audiologist's intervention.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:51.620]   One of the problems with hearing aids,
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:55.220]   I wear 'em, I wear resounds before that I wore Starkey,
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:59.900]   $6,000 and Medicare doesn't cover it,
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:04.180]   insurance doesn't cover it, $6,000 FDA,
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:06.180]   and that's the rule chain in August,
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:08.820]   but it didn't affect, take effect until this week.
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:10.700]   Now obviously if you have profound hearing loss,
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:12.340]   you probably should go to an audiologist.
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:14.740]   And it's interesting, there's a guy named Adam Currie,
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:17.500]   you probably heard of him, the pod father,
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.340]   who also he says, "Where is hearing aids?"
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:21.340]   He's dead against this.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:24.220]   Yeah, maybe he's working for the Audiology Association of America.
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:27.460]   I don't know, I'm sure my audiologist doesn't like it either.
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:29.620]   But it's very expensive, you have to go to an audiologist,
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:33.580]   they do a hearing test, they then sell you the hearing aids,
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:35.980]   which they tune, they fine tune, they have software
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:39.620]   to fine tune the hearing aids so that they are exactly
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:43.380]   the curve that your hearing loss shows.
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:45.460]   But it's a very high price you pay
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.940]   and you have to go back to the audiologist regularly
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:50.940]   for tune-ups and to upsell you and so forth.
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:54.700]   I get emails and brochures for my audiologist all the time
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:56.020]   saying, "Hey, we got some new hearing aids,
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:59.180]   "you're gonna really, really like."
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:00.820]   White House says a move could save people
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:02.300]   as much as $3,000.
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:07.100]   Sony has already unveiled a pair of high tech hearing aids,
[01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:11.300]   very similar to what you'll get in their headsets
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.700]   and earbuds they can sync with a smartphone app
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:17.820]   via Bluetooth, you could do a self fit,
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.020]   Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Best Buy and others
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:21.940]   are all selling over the counter hearing aids,
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:26.580]   prices ranging from $200 to $1,000 and up.
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:31.140]   Adam says, "You're not gonna get a good experience
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:33.660]   "and that's gonna, in the long run,
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.420]   "it's gonna scare you away from hearing aids."
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.340]   And that's the biggest problem is that
[01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:39.220]   for whatever reason, whether they're too expensive
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:42.140]   or they don't work well, older folks like me
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:44.660]   don't use hearing aids and there's all sorts of issues,
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:47.180]   including cognitive, I mean, obviously the first one
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:48.740]   is your wife gets mad at you.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:52.700]   But besides that, there's apparently cognitive decline
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:55.540]   can occur if you don't hear very well.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:58.980]   So it's potentially a big issue.
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:04.940]   Adam says it's bows that got this rule.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:08.820]   I don't think it's, I mean, maybe bows stands to benefit.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.860]   - We've certainly been advocating for a long time for Adam
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:12.420]   and this has been the works for years.
[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:15.060]   We did stories on this maybe four years ago
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.900]   when it was first-- - I think it's the right thing.
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:20.620]   - Do you think there's any merit to Adam's complaints?
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:25.620]   - Well, we, with eyes we have reading glasses
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:27.660]   which you can buy without a prescription
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:29.180]   and they certainly serve a purpose.
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:31.780]   But the fact you can just go into Walgreens
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.220]   and buy reading glasses doesn't mean
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:35.220]   that people who have more serious eye problems
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:36.980]   should not be seen in eye doctor
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:38.940]   and buying prescription glasses.
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:40.300]   - That's a good analogy.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.140]   - Yeah. - Seems like it's maybe
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.700]   a little bit like that and that basic issues
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:46.340]   can be dealt with with a non-prescription device
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:49.220]   but that does not mean that we don't need people
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:50.140]   who know what they're doing.
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:54.380]   And if you really have serious mission problems like I do,
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:56.340]   reading glasses are not gonna solve it for you.
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:58.900]   - You can't buy the Dean of Dells for $5
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:01.460]   and expect your eyesight to improve.
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.860]   I do have to say though,
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:08.140]   this is a big opportunity for big tech, Apple particularly.
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:11.220]   Samsung phones for the longest time
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.540]   had a hearing test built in.
[01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:15.100]   I think iPhones now do.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:17.580]   Where it's just exactly like the audiologist test,
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:20.420]   they play tones at various frequencies and levels
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.540]   into your ears and you press a button if you can hear it
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:25.100]   and you press another button if you can't.
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.620]   And I think they work pretty well.
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:29.420]   It seems to produce the same curve
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:31.380]   that my audiologist gets.
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:33.180]   I'm sure it's a good thing to have.
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:36.060]   But an audiologist is not a physician
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.420]   and they're not doing an ear nose
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:39.900]   and throat checkup or anything like that.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:41.220]   They look in your ear,
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:46.580]   comment on how much earwax or how little earwax you have
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.820]   and then test you.
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.940]   I feel like we could do a lot of that.
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.900]   I actually think Apple with its AirPods
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:56.460]   is very much looking at this space.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:59.980]   Louise, do you know anybody who wears hearing aids?
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:00.820]   Too young, no one.
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:03.020]   - I probably do, but I can't think of anyone
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:03.860]   off top of my head.
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:06.460]   But I think the reading glasses analogy
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:07.660]   is really perfect for this.
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.340]   And I think we have such,
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:13.700]   just systematically from up and down messed up healthcare system
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:15.220]   that anything like this that can--
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.100]   - That's a good point.
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:18.100]   - That's a good point.
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:21.500]   Kind of a response to our crappy health insurance, isn't it?
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:22.420]   Yeah.
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:23.340]   - That's definitely part of it.
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:25.780]   Yeah, and I think just like improving people's senses
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.900]   is such a thing that is like crucial for quality of life.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.940]   So we should just totally encouraging this.
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.340]   - I also think a lot of older people
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:35.020]   don't wear hearing aids because there's a stigma.
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.020]   Right?
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:38.060]   And I think if they're AirPods,
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.580]   there's definitely not a stigma
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:42.260]   to having AirPods in your ears.
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:45.180]   Everywhere I go, people are walking around
[01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:47.420]   with AirPods in their ears.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:50.140]   It doesn't imply that you're somehow hard of hearing
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:51.540]   or that you're old.
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:53.500]   In fact, if anything, you might look a little hipper
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:54.580]   and younger.
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:58.860]   So I can't really see a negative to this
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:00.860]   unless you're an audiologist.
[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:01.700]   Then there's some negatives.
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:04.340]   But again, like an optometrist,
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:06.620]   you still need them for profound loss
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:08.700]   or a variety of different conditions.
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:11.660]   I love the idea of AirPods getting smarter.
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:13.420]   It's a form of augmented reality.
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:15.380]   - Totally.
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:16.220]   I think it's really interesting
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:18.300]   and I think hearing is really interesting.
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.660]   And what we can do in that realm is cool.
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:21.500]   So.
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:22.340]   - As dwindles.
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:23.180]   - Well, I'm not that bad.
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:24.020]   - Yeah.
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:25.980]   As dwindle is saying in our chatroom,
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:27.860]   you can change people's lives drastically
[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:29.940]   with $20 technology.
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:32.100]   But until now, we've sold it for $6,000.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:33.900]   That's a really good point.
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.820]   That's a real, how many people don't have hearing aids
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:38.220]   just 'cause they just can't afford it.
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.340]   So I'm all for this.
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:45.580]   Kanye West is buying Parler.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:49.220]   Nothing more to say.
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:51.820]   (laughing)
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:52.660]   - Hi, yeah.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:53.980]   - I got nothing.
[01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:54.980]   - You see not--
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:56.340]   - That's nothing.
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:59.700]   - The bird got some statistics
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.100]   and their daily active users are $60,000.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:04.980]   And it's just really upsetting to think
[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:06.140]   that's not really worth much.
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:07.020]   It's not worth the choir.
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:10.340]   - The Virgis story was there basically a failing company
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:14.140]   taking advantage of somebody's mental illness.
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:17.020]   - I think that's unfortunately potentially
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:17.940]   what's going on here.
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:19.820]   I do think we are in the age too though
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:23.580]   of sort of the celebrity social network owner,
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:26.620]   which has happened with media for a long time.
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:29.220]   I think in some ways the media business
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:31.220]   to some extent is sort of choose your billionaire, right?
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.060]   And--
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.660]   - Jeff Bezos buying the Washington Post, for instance.
[01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.980]   - Right, or, you know,
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:41.220]   South China Morning Post, Alibaba.
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:43.900]   I can't remember what the billionaire of the LA Times,
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:45.300]   what they're claim to fame is,
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:47.860]   but the Atlantic is owned by--
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:49.180]   - Laurie Power Jobs.
[01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:50.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:53.620]   - Right, we've seen this for a while.
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:55.020]   So I think it's interesting to see it go
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:56.180]   into social media now.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:58.340]   I mean, he's totally copying Elon, right?
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:52:59.660]   He's like, "He's gonna sell my word.
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:00.500]   I want one now."
[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.020]   - Yeah, very much.
[01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:03.740]   I could do that.
[01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:08.620]   - Mehta has been told you gotta sell Giffy, or is it Giffy?
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:09.460]   - It's Giffy. - Giffy.
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:10.300]   - Giffy.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.940]   - Giffy. - Giffy.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.420]   - Not the peanut butter.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:15.420]   The animated gifts.
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:16.740]   Jiffs.
[01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:20.980]   The UK Watchdog has said, "Nope, you can't own it."
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:23.500]   US government had no problem with it,
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:25.860]   but the UK says, "Nope, you can't own it."
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:30.220]   - I think our antitrust regulators are so un-substicated,
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:31.380]   my God.
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.940]   - It's amazing, isn't it?
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:34.340]   It's sad.
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:38.300]   I think it's like, I think we made Facebook
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:41.220]   into an antitrust issue, and they're like, "Okay,
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.060]   we're doing it now."
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:44.500]   And it's like, "No, we wanted you to systematically
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:48.980]   look at the market, not just block anything Facebook wanted
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:50.500]   to buy." - Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:55.380]   Are you ready for an app that will let you speak
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:59.380]   to your dead, long, lost loved ones?
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:02.380]   No.
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:03.340]   (laughs)
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:04.420]   Too bad.
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:06.140]   Too bad you're gonna get it.
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:08.020]   Really good article by Charlotte G.
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:11.380]   in the MIT Technology Review.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:13.140]   Her parents are still alive,
[01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:17.460]   but she asked them to submit the four,
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:19.980]   to this four hour interview you have to do
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:24.340]   for this California-based company here after AI.
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:27.060]   They do four hours with an interviewer,
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:31.180]   and then your loved ones, whenever you pass,
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:33.460]   can talk to you, even though you're dead.
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:39.860]   Now her parents are alive, so this was more of an experiment.
[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:44.940]   She says, "From what I could glean over a dozen conversations
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.020]   with my virtually deceased parents,
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:50.620]   this really will make it easier to keep close
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:52.860]   to the people you love."
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:55.380]   She says, "So it's an app on your phone."
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:55:00.100]   She says, "She started talking to them,
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:04.780]   and at first they were kind of tinny-sounding in distance,
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:07.460]   'cause I guess they're sampling your voice
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:10.540]   as if they were huddled around a phone and prison,
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:13.260]   but as we chatted, they slowly started to sound
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:14.460]   more like themselves.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:16.700]   Maybe it was processing, I don't know.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:18.740]   They told me, "Now this is weird."
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:21.540]   Personal stories I'd never heard.
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:23.420]   I learned about the first,
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:26.700]   and certainly not last time my dad got drunk.
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:29.460]   Mom talked about getting in trouble for staying out late.
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:31.980]   Now I'm curious if the AI's making these up
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:34.180]   or if they had them in the interview,
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:37.580]   they gave me life advice and told me things
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:41.060]   about their childhood as well as my own.
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:42.520]   It was mesmerizing.
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:46.780]   - I think the last thing is to talk more to your loved ones
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:49.260]   while you're still lucky and help get them around.
[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:52.820]   - Yeah, and also maybe run a camera
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:53.740]   while you're talking to them.
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:54.580]   - There you go.
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:55.980]   - So later on you have that video.
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:57.060]   - There you go.
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:59.140]   I did do that with my mom last time I saw her
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:01.380]   and I've done that several times.
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:04.900]   Just have video of her talking about stuff.
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:07.540]   And it is really valuable.
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:10.140]   But apparently they're more than one company
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:11.940]   that's doing this.
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:15.660]   To create a digital replica of someone with a good chance
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:18.820]   of seeming like a convincingly authentic representation,
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:22.140]   you need lots of data here after AI
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.380]   whose work starts with subjects
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:26.940]   when they are still alive, ask them questions for hours.
[01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:28.300]   Everything from the earliest memories
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:30.220]   to their first date to what they believe will happen
[01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:31.420]   after they die.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:36.260]   Initially they were doing this with a live human
[01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:39.740]   but they're now doing it with a bot.
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:40.980]   'Cause why?
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:42.700]   What do you need a human for?
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:50.340]   Would you do this, Louise, with your loved ones?
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:52.500]   - So I think it's kind of interesting
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.140]   'cause on one hand it's really creepy
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:57.540]   but I also think the history of humanity shows us
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:00.620]   that worshiping the dead and trying to talk to the dead
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:02.020]   is very human.
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:05.060]   Right, it's a ritual we've always had that you go
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:07.500]   and you honor your ancestors and you talk to them
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:08.860]   to some extent, right?
[01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:11.580]   I think it's a little weird that they're now talking back
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:15.220]   or this AI of them is talking back
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:17.780]   but I think that there is something really alluring
[01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:22.020]   about this that feels really sort of core human
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:24.500]   but I understand why other people find it creepy
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:27.260]   but other people find the day of the dead creepy, right?
[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:29.580]   Or like the idea of like having a soul
[01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:31.340]   sort of creepy or haunted house is creepy
[01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:33.660]   so I think it's almost like a ghost, right?
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:36.840]   But I think ghosts are like part of human folklore.
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:43.140]   - Yeah, you know, it's very black mirror to me.
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.620]   - It is, totally.
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:46.780]   - And I don't know if I'd be creeped out or not.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:49.180]   She says on one occasion my husband
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:52.220]   mistook my testing for an actual phone call.
[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:54.380]   When he realized it wasn't he rolled his eyes
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:56.460]   as if I were completely deranged.
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:58.460]   (laughs)
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:01.180]   Her mom and dad arrived via email attachment.
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.860]   I could communicate with them through the Echo app
[01:58:03.860 --> 01:58:06.300]   on a phone or an Amazon Echo device.
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:11.060]   When I finally opened the file with my colleagues watching
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:13.300]   and listening on Zoom, my hands were shaking.
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:15.860]   I hadn't, because of the lockdown
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:17.900]   she hadn't seen her parents in six months.
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:21.700]   Echo opened hereafter, she said,
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:25.180]   "Would you rather speak with Paul or with Jane?"
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:27.500]   I opted for, I know, creepy.
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:30.540]   I opted for my mom, a voice that was hers,
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.860]   but weirdly stiff and cold spoke.
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:35.940]   Hello, this is Jane Lee and I'm happy to tell you
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:37.380]   about my life, how are you today?
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.220]   I laughed nervously.
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:41.940]   Well, thanks mom, how are you?
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:43.020]   Good.
[01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:45.260]   At my end, I'm doing well.
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:48.220]   At my end, at my end, I'm doing well.
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:49.980]   You sound kind of unnatural.
[01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:52.180]   She ignored me and kept on speaking.
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:57.180]   Ah, there's a podcast, if you're curious.
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:59:00.180]   AI finds its voice, the podcast.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:02.180]   In machines we trust season four,
[01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:04.180]   episode 10 from the MIT technology review.
[01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:07.180]   If you wanna actually hear this conversation up,
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:10.180]   and it's not the only one, there are many companies
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:12.180]   now starting to do this, 'cause we can synthesize the voice.
[01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:13.180]   That's easy, right, Harry?
[01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:15.180]   I mean, that's the same thing.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:17.180]   Yeah, it's getting better and better.
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.180]   Also, the video part is also becoming increasingly doable.
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:21.180]   And presumably, there will be lots of people
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:23.180]   who do this where you can see.
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:24.180]   Oh, that gets me.
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:25.180]   And here.
[01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:29.180]   But I do feel that like, it's not creepy so much as stupid
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:31.180]   and manipulative on some level.
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:37.180]   I mean, it's basically, this is like a lysa,
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:39.180]   except with a fancier interface.
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:42.180]   You're not talking to your relatives.
[01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:45.180]   I imagine they're not, these conversations are not as
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:48.180]   sophisticated as they seem.
[01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:51.180]   If you have, I think it's wonderful to have four hours
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:53.180]   of your relatives telling you stories,
[01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:56.180]   but I don't know whether you need this AI interface
[01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:57.180]   to make that useful.
[01:59:57.180 --> 01:59:59.180]   Just listen to the recordings.
[01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:00.180]   Yeah.
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:02.180]   Oh, it's very strange.
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:06.180]   Speaking of passing on,
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:07.180]   D.D.
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:10.180]   Dietrich Mathischitz, Austria's richest man,
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:13.180]   the man who founded Red Bull,
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:17.180]   has passed away at the age of 78.
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:18.180]   He still got lots of energy though.
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.180]   I got to tell you, he's still,
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:24.180]   he founded Red Bull in 1984 with a Thai businessman
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:28.180]   after discovering the caffeinated beverage eased his jet lag
[02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:30.180]   during a trip to Asia.
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:35.180]   They started selling Red Bull in 1987.
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:40.180]   By 2020, Red Bull was selling tens of millions every day.
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:45.180]   In fact, Katie Perry, when I saw her on Friday,
[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:48.180]   she was wearing a beer can bra.
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:50.180]   I don't know how any other way to describe it.
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:52.180]   And pretended she was pouring beer,
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:54.180]   a beer came out of it except she admitted later it was Red Bull.
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:58.180]   So she was drinking diet Red Bull during her concert.
[02:00:58.180 --> 02:00:59.180]   It marks her,
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:02.180]   it makes markets a variety of Red Bull beverages from cola to
[02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:05.180]   tonics to cactus fruit infused flavors,
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:10.180]   a revenue of 6.3 billion euros in 2020.
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:14.180]   D.D. built a personal fortune estimated 15 billion
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:19.180]   dollars on Red Bull.
[02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:27.180]   So he has passed away the end of the Red Bull.
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:28.180]   And that's the end of the show.
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.180]   I like to end with a obituary.
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:32.180]   I don't know why.
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:34.180]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:36.180]   All three of you are wonderful.
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:39.180]   Lou will catch you every Thursday on this weekend
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:40.180]   Enterprise Tech.
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:41.180]   Yes?
[02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:42.180]   Friday, Friday, 1.30 p.m.
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:44.180]   Friday, Friday, 1.30 p.m.
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:47.180]   After I leave on Wednesday, I don't know what happens around here.
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.180]   So Friday, 1 p.m.
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:51.180]   You can watch it live or subscribe.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:53.180]   Best thing to do is subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:55.180]   So you get it automatically.
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:01:58.180]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:00.180]   Thanks for the good work you do.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:01.180]   We really appreciate you on the show.
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.180]   How we love doing it.
[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:03.180]   We love doing it.
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:04.180]   Thank you.
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:05.180]   You're great.
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:06.180]   Thanks to Louise Mazzakis too.
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:10.180]   It's great to see you again after all these months or years.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:14.180]   It's been a while, but I'm really glad to see that you're with Semaphore.
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:15.180]   This is exciting.
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:18.180]   I've now subscribed to all the newsletters, including yours.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:20.180]   Thank you so much, Leo.
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:21.180]   I really appreciate that.
[02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:22.180]   Yeah.
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:23.180]   And so much fun talking with you.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:24.180]   Yeah.
[02:02:24.180 --> 02:02:25.180]   And yep.
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:28.180]   Go to Semaphore.com and on the right side you will see the tech newsletter that I'm helping
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:29.180]   right.
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:30.180]   I would love your feedback and your thoughts.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:33.180]   We'll be in your inbox twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays.
[02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:36.180]   I like the global focus.
[02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:40.180]   In the US we do not get international coverage at all.
[02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:41.180]   Oh, it's a...
[02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:42.180]   Yeah.
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:45.180]   And there's so much going on around the world.
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:48.180]   This is great, especially Africa, which is really under-covered.
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:49.180]   Yeah, totally.
