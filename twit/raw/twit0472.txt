[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   It's time for "Twit!"
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.840]   Robert Scobel joins Clayton Morris and Tim Stevens.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.640]   Who won the earthquake news Olympics?
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.440]   I say Twitter.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.440]   Robert Scobel says, Facebook, find out
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.680]   why he thinks Facebook is the best and why I disagree.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.160]   We'll also talk about Google's autonomous vehicles.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000]   Apparently, they're allowed to go 10 miles over the speed limit
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.840]   and a whole lot more.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.480]   This week in tech, coming up next.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.280]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.960]   This is "Twit."

[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.320]   The show where we cover the week's tech news, such as it is this week.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.040]   You know, pretty much the dog days of August.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.800]   There's nothing to talk about.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.120]   But good news.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.400]   We've got some of the best technology analysts in the business
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.320]   here to not talk about it.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.400]   I'll start all the way over here to the right, Mr. Robert Scobull.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.640]   The Scobullizer is here.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.000]   He came stolen to my office on Friday, and we couldn't get rid of him.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.880]   So--
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.160]   Well, I had to wear your Mickey Mouse ears.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.520]   I saw that.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.960]   And I saw it on the ball, you know?
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.720]   And I-- and it-- now, did you only post that picture on Facebook?
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.320]   Did you put that anywhere else?
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.600]   Yeah, just on Facebook and Tanya took one as well.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.000]   So that's intriguing.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.880]   Are you a Facebook-only kind of guy now?
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.400]   I'm spending more and more time on Facebook, particularly
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.600]   for the funny little personal stuff like that.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.200]   Yeah, I hate Facebook with a passion that burns like the flames of hell.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.480]   But we'll talk about that.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.800]   Here's a picture of Robert invading my space.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.560]   Sitting on the ball, taking control, man.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.080]   Isn't that every geek's dream to be leo-appointed when he's in the empire?
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.000]   You can bet it's my dream.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.920]   Did we disinfect the ball?
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.320]   Also with us, Mr. Tim Stevens of CNET, their automotive editor.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.160]   You should be here.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.760]   We got the big races going on at the raceway over here.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.880]   I would love to be there.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.400]   But we'll be coming out, I think, soon maybe.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.920]   I don't know, early September or something like that.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.160]   I should probably be out there again.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.440]   Good.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.840]   We'll come up and visit us when you do.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.240]   I would love to.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.000]   We're just down the road from Infineon, not far at all.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.280]   It looks like you're in-- are you in Upper New York State?
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.640]   Where are you?
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.160]   Yes.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.880]   I'm at home up around Albany, New York.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.840]   Albany, New York.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.440]   Also New York State from beautiful Lake Tinky Winky.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.480]   Mr. Clayton Morris.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.960]   He's-- boy, that's a beautiful shot.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.920]   Oh, thank you.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.080]   You look great.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.560]   Tim, did you-- I didn't see you at the community center this afternoon.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.080]   I'll see you there later for shuffleboard.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.440]   I wasn't sure what time the co-op opened today,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.240]   so I wanted to get there.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   Bingo.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.760]   A little later.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.120]   Right, but tonight is pot luck, so you'll need to bring--
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.440]   are you going to bring some of your fabulous biscuits and--
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.960]   Absolutely.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.480]   And we've got some fresh honey today as well for the high.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.800]   And that is actually not all the way up.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.920]   That concludes the fire report on this edition.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.120]   Twig.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.760]   Now, I'm glad you guys are on vacation.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.200]   This is the time to be on vacation.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.080]   It's a slow time.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.080]   And, Tekken, we're about to head into a very busy time
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.640]   because September 4th, Motorola's going to make its announcement.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.320]   September 9th, of course, the Apple announcements.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.720]   So now is the slow period.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.240]   We all just kind of--
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.520]   let's be honest, you had to find three people who were not
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.720]   at Burning Man.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.800]   I don't know.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.920]   Burning Man is, I guess, now gentrified, some have said,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.680]   by all the tech executives who fly in via helicopter
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.520]   or drive in and customized buses and air streams.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.920]   I don't know.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.560]   I've never been to Burning Man.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.720]   Well, I shouldn't-- I take it back.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.960]   I haven't been to Burning Man since it happened
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.240]   on Ocean Beach in San Francisco, which is many, many years ago.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.320]   It's now in the desert.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.920]   So now you-- any hankering to go?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.880]   Tim, have you ever been to Burning Man?
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.000]   No, I've never been.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.960]   I've talked with the Miriam Jouar quite a few times
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   about her experiences there.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.360]   And it always sounds like a hell of a show.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.600]   But I don't know if it's exactly my cup of tea.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.920]   It'd be good to visit, I think, for a day.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.720]   But I don't know if I'd want to do a whole week right there.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.960]   They're going up-- actually, a lot of people--
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.000]   a lot of the day visitors go later.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's a Labor Day weekend.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.040]   The people who are going now are building stuff, right?
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.600]   There's some amazing buildings that they put up out there.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.960]   And I love watching the videos of all the sculptures
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.720]   and everything like that.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.080]   But yeah, that's a long time to be in the desert for me.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.400]   There's also many, many parties that are world-class.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.600]   A lot of creative people go there to experiment
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.560]   with a performance.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.400]   The orgy tent.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.080]   Well, there's that too.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.080]   Yeah, it was going to go to the orgy tent.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.600]   It was going to go to the orgy tent this year.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.360]   I think all the twins put it to the orgy tent.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.000]   We could have a--
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.360]   Well, that's the reason people go to Burning Man.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.960]   I know why.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.360]   I know why they go there to use drugs
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.000]   and have sexual relations.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.560]   Some people--
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.040]   No, I've read that go there.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.800]   Actually, there's the last thing you'd want to do.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.880]   It's full of alkaloid sand.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.480]   Chasing.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.200]   I misread the invitation, though.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.960]   It said orgy tent.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.760]   I thought it said ho-gee tent.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.760]   Now that I go to.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.680]   And I love a good ho-ge.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.680]   That's--
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.240]   Our mutual first trade red cliff invited me to go--
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.280]   Trade love photography.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.800]   And that aspect of it would have been appealing to me.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.000]   I don't know that I could justify telling Fox, though.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   No.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.200]   I'm going to go.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.480]   I think you'd lose your credentials if you went.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.400]   Although if you go, you should wear a nice suit,
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.480]   the British collar that you wear, the tie,
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.360]   real red tie, blue suit, white shirt.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.320]   You'd fit right in.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.160]   And no pants.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.640]   And no pants.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.560]   You know what?
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.440]   That might work.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.400]   That would work out there.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.960]   That might work.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.320]   And ride around on a giant ferris wheel or a unicycle.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.040]   So the results are in.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   And Twitter won the internet this week.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.880]   The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay Area at 3.21
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.280]   this morning woke up.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.160]   Apparently, every startup entrepreneur in the--
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.720]   every Twitter user in my--
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.120]   I tell you, the first thing I did after,
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.880]   I jumped out of bed shouting earthquake
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.640]   and ran around in circles as I pulled out the smartphone
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.000]   and looked at Twitter.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.040]   There was nothing on Google+, there was nothing on--
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.920]   well, Facebook, there was a lot of people doing the ALS ice
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.760]   bucket challenge three days ago.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.960]   And then Twitter was all about the earthquake.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.720]   I got the magnitude, the epicenter, almost instantly.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.160]   What you didn't see-- because I Facebooked first
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.120]   and then tweeted, and several people
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.840]   said I was the first one to tweet.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.360]   I was still writing when the house was shaking.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.640]   So on both.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.680]   Oh, bully for you.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.240]   Because that's what we do.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.680]   We don't care about saving our lives.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.360]   We care about getting the first tweet out.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.000]   So while the futon was shaking, you were tweeting.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.840]   Exactly.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.440]   Dude, what was your first tweet?
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.640]   I said big earthquake.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.360]   Big earthquake.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.000]   Big earthquake was my first one on Facebook.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.120]   And then big earthquake woke me up was my tweet.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.400]   And well, I just had a curiosity.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.840]   Within a minute, because I put both screens up,
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.080]   within a minute, my entire Facebook feed was the earthquake.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.320]   And my entire Twitter feed was the earthquake.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.000]   So it depends on who you followed, who you've
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.640]   lied to, you've taught the engine that you want to see.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.080]   And even what you've put into the engine--
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.760]   so I bet it saw that I'm interested in an earthquake
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.960]   because I posted something about earthquake.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.160]   And it brought me a whole bunch of stuff immediately.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.360]   It was pretty interesting.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.120]   Facebook's algorithm baffles me.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.080]   I cannot figure out-- and I've complained about before,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.760]   you said, I should come over and show you
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.040]   how to get Facebook working.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.440]   I have yet to-- in fact, I was trying
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.400]   to find the picture of you in my studio on Facebook.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.600]   I saw it immediately.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.360]   And then it disappeared.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.240]   And I never found it again.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.040]   I actually have to go to your page to find it now.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.160]   I can't figure out how it works at all.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.040]   It doesn't work.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.600]   You're supposed to read it and then click like.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.280]   And then it'll show you something else.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.560]   And as Matt Houghton showed, if you like everything,
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.640]   it's going to go haywire.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.400]   Or if you like nothing, right?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.000]   Maybe that's it.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.560]   So you think I don't like enough if I liked more stuff?
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.360]   It's what things you've liked, who your friends are,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.120]   who you put on close friends list,
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.440]   and who you put on acquaintance list.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.480]   Because if you put somebody in a close friends list,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.840]   you'll see more items from them.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.000]   So you're actually on my close friends list
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.800]   because I want to see every time you talk about Twitter
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.480]   or something, right?
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   Close friends list.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.000]   OK.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.040]   That doesn't mean that--
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.760]   I'm actually a little bit--
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.760]   I'm going to watch Facebook lately.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.800]   It has been getting better.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   The more I hide, I find the more focused my news feed gets.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.880]   There you go.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.080]   So it takes you really kind of cultivating it
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.760]   to get it to be any good.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.960]   But they do not expose how you do it.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.880]   I mean, they don't say, oh, this is what you should do.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.800]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.040]   Because it's trying to study your emotional attachment
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.440]   to things, to content, to places, to people.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.920]   And so I'm giving it a more signal than most human beings.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.280]   When you haven't given enough signal,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.440]   it doesn't really work that way.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.400]   So here's my question.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.440]   I see this post from Julio Ojeda Zapata.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.320]   Great journalist at the Minneapolis or Minnesota Twin
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.160]   Press.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.360]   And it's of salsa dancing.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.760]   Now, if I like this, what is the signal?
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.600]   Am I sending a signal that I like salsa dancing?
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.840]   Am I sending a signal I like Julio?
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.880]   You like Julio?
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.200]   You like salsa dancing?
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.640]   You like videos?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.120]   Every one of them is a little tiny vote for more of that.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.640]   How do I vote for less of this?
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.640]   Click hide.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.200]   So they're over on the right side.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.320]   There's a little button.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.440]   But this is my problem.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.560]   Am I hiding Julio?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.800]   No, you're hiding that specific post.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.160]   And you watch the signal.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.280]   Is it going to give me less Julio?
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.760]   You're going to see maybe less salsa dancing.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.960]   So it might-- you don't know how it works.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.720]   But you admit this, you are guessing.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.600]   I know that it's a signal that--
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.680]   Do you have to stand on the--
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.160]   Clue!
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.560]   They are watching the conference.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.640]   I know they're watching.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.480]   But do you have any clue what any of this is doing?
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.920]   Don't look behind the curtain, gentlemen.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.640]   Quite a bit.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.760]   Quite a bit.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.680]   Here's an example.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.160]   If I post a family photo, the first people to like it
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.760]   are almost always my family members.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.640]   And if I post something like I'm on Twitch, like I just did,
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.520]   it goes to a more general audience, and it goes further.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.000]   So it's keeping track of the kind of content
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.920]   that you click like on and hide, and it's
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.080]   trying to bring you more--
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.840]   I disagree.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.600]   I don't see how Facebook could possibly
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.160]   distinguish between a post about family members
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.240]   or a post family member to be interested in.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.000]   How does it know your family's not named Twitch?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.520]   Because they're all on my list.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.160]   I put them all on my family list.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.480]   What if you call a family member a Twitter?
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.920]   But here-- Robert, I don't want to steal your feed.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   I don't know.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.520]   No, there's a family list over here.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.120]   You clicked family, and there's 32 people on that.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.840]   So those--
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.600]   My Facebook knows that these people--
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.800]   Well, OK, now I never see her stuff,
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.040]   because she's on my family list, and I've taught my main feed
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.080]   not to show me her stuff, or my brother's--
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.720]   Tavern, right?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:46.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.280]   I don't see-- look, there's a cat photo.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.040]   I never see cat photos on my main feed.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.920]   You're drunk, Robert.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.200]   This makes no sense.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.400]   You're saying I don't see her because she's on my family list,
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.520]   but I see more family.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.720]   I don't understand.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.320]   Because it--
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.320]   Right, isn't that precisely what you want to see more on?
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   --to see more on.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.040]   It's building a contextual system that is studying
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.800]   how to get news to you, route news to you,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.160]   and it's trying to pick the best 30 things to show you
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.240]   right now, right?
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   Actually, I take it back here.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:13.800]   So look at my name.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.400]   You're not drunk.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.120]   Facebook is drunk.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.000]   Now, here, I don't want to see this kind of post,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.520]   so I hide that, right?
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.960]   Now I see a gig of own post.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.600]   I see Eric, who runs Pebble Watch.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.160]   I see Francisco, who does conferences for executives.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.560]   I see Steve Jurbitson, who's not only a neighbor.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.560]   Is this all stuff you want to see?
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.760]   Yes, this is all pretty high quality.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.840]   How do you know that other stuff you want to see
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.920]   is not on there?
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.160]   Because I can use a list to see all of it.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.800]   And when I click on my acquaintance list, for instance,
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.320]   I see all my acquaintances.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.840]   You know, you're the only person in the world
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.280]   who's done this much less--
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.120]   It worked.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.040]   That's why I know it's so great.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.720]   I mean, don't you think that that much curation--
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.560]   no way in the world, the average user of Facebook
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.560]   is doing this much curation like you do.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.040]   That's true.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.640]   You do this on Google+, you do this on Twitter.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.560]   My signals are helping the engine learn
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.000]   because the way Gmail's filters work,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.120]   the way the machine learning on Facebook works,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.880]   if I teach it how to create a good feed--
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   and there's a whole team working on this at Facebook,
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.360]   they're trying to pick the right thing for the right person
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.680]   at the right time.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.400]   If I help that engine by liking things,
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.320]   it brings more things into your view as well.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.000]   It feels to me like a pinball game.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.600]   You like something, then something else comes
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.960]   and you get too much of that.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.120]   It doesn't ever seem to really suit, as far as I know.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.400]   It does get better.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.040]   And my friends and I, when we compare and I pull out the feed,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.760]   it is running away with the game.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   Oh, no.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.280]   Facebook, when--
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.120]   Oh, not even close.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.280]   I guarantee you, in a year, you are going to come back to me
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.560]   and say I was wrong.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.760]   That Facebook is running away with the game,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.880]   particularly if you ship the search engine
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.000]   and if you ship the network thing.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.720]   It is running away with the game.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   Here's another way it's running away with the game.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.920]   I post a video done on my iPhone, on the Facebook app,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.640]   and it's up in two minutes, because it's compressing on the GPU
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.040]   of the iPhone, and then it's uploading
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.000]   while I'm typing the description.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.920]   So by the time I hit publish, it nearly goes live instantly.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.040]   Google+, I just did the same thing three days ago.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.080]   It took 10 hours for a video from my iPhone
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.600]   to get online live.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.520]   This is-- Facebook is running away with the game
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.360]   and all a lot of levels.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.200]   And if Twitter and Google+, don't
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.240]   fix what's going on.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.760]   They're going to notice that other people are going away from it.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   And I notice for most people--
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.320]   What game are we talking about?
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.800]   Are those videos searchable, for instance, if--
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.080]   Not yet.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.600]   Not yet.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.160]   That's the issue, right?
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.680]   So someone takes a video of themselves in their backyard
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.520]   doing an ice bucket challenge.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.800]   There's the first place I went after the other cook was Twitter.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.400]   I didn't even consider Facebook.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.320]   Facebook in one minute brought me 20 posts.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.520]   I posted a whole bunch of them right instantly off my iPhone
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.840]   that I would see on my iPhone.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.760]   What was the first place-- well, you weren't in the Bay Area.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.480]   And either of you were in the Bay Area.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   No, sir.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.480]   You probably didn't jump up and say--
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   I want to write a letter.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.800]   --at 3.21 for no reason at all.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.920]   Let me check Twitter.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.560]   It didn't even occur to me to go to Facebook.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.200]   I'll give you a more german example.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.760]   When you heard Robin Williams died, did you go to Twitter?
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.280]   I just--
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.560]   Yeah, I flipped it on-- well, I flipped it on television
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   because I want--
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.680]   Oh, you're a TV guy.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.400]   I'll tell you, my wife yelled, she saw it on Facebook.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.720]   I went to Twitter and Facebook instantly.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.840]   And I was still very early in the story.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.200]   Most people were-- when I said Robin Williams just died,
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.040]   the XYZ-- I forget whether it was ABC or somebody
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.520]   is reporting-- people were saying, dude, is that a hoax?
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:48.920]   Right.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.680]   Because they didn't believe that it was so early in the news.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.840]   I don't think you're calm.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.920]   You're typical, though, Robert.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.520]   I think most people would don't think of Facebook
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.040]   as a good source for breaking news.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.480]   Absolutely true.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.560]   I'm ahead.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.280]   And that's why I know in a year you're
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.680]   going to come back to me and say, are you were right?
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.480]   This thing is running away with the game.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.920]   The game game game game game game.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.400]   My feed is just filled with--
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.560]   Here is a topic--
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.400]   Social--
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:14.880]   Farmville.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.280]   That's the game it's winning.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:16.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.960]   Social-- no, I don't see any games on my feed.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.360]   I taught it in my show.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:20.760]   You know what?
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   I don't see any more games on my feed either, I have to say.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.640]   So Facebook--
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   But the topic game--
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.400]   But the game is like viral junk weird news articles are the ones--
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.880]   and maybe it's because I click like--
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.880]   I'm worthy.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.280]   Do you like up worthy?
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   I just--
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.200]   I don't see any up worthy.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.480]   No, I've taken up worthy out.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.200]   I liked one Robert Scoble post.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.400]   Now I can't help but see Robert Scoble every time
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.840]   I go to Facebook.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.200]   Yep, because it's studying your signal.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.440]   You give it a little bit of a--
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.520]   I just loaded this.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.400]   Look at-- this is my Facebook feed.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.360]   Here's a video that was posted four hours ago.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.160]   Here's-- I don't know when you liked Wix.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.600]   I don't-- I guess this is an ad.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.080]   So I'm not going to care about that.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.520]   That's an ad.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.200]   Russell posted this tweet about Twitter 11--
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.440]   about to the earthquake 11 hours ago, nine hours ago,
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.080]   two hours-- this is not current.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.360]   Does it mean you're blaming me for this?
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.560]   11 hours ago.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.920]   Hey, Petaluma friends, did you feel that quake?
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.160]   That's in my current feed just now.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.880]   Yes, it's your fault because you haven't been on Facebook.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.400]   It's your fault.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.480]   It's showing you interesting stuff from the past hours
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.080]   that you haven't been on Facebook.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.880]   I've been on Facebook all day, so--
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.440]   No, no, that's wrong, that's wrong, Robert.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.680]   I've been using Facebook a lot because I've been looking--
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.960]   Well, here's something 23 minutes ago on my feed.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.400]   Here's Business Week 24 minutes ago.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.960]   I admit, you're winning at Facebook.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.680]   But I just-- OK, get this.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.280]   I just refreshed-- wait a minute, Robert.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.320]   I just refreshed my feed.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.520]   What did I get?
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.920]   YouTube post from August 22nd, two days ago.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.440]   Let me ask you this, Robert, since you--
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.240]   I mean, I don't know that there's anybody better
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.880]   at this than you, but--
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.400]   It thinks Paul Therott's still in Barcelona.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.360]   According to Facebook, Paul Therott has been home for a week,
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.840]   is still in Barcelona.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.200]   This is useless.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.120]   Let me ask you this, Robert.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.040]   I know that pictures--
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   I'm going to put the time into it.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.600]   Go ahead, Clayton.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.520]   Robert, let me ask you this.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.680]   I mean, I know that pictures get such a huge reaction, right?
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.480]   So in my Facebook feed, I just posted--
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.600]   we were heading on vacation.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.240]   I was playing around with this one of these giant ass
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.360]   windows phones.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.240]   And I'm just shooting some photos while my wife was driving.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.320]   And so that post that I put up there,
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.240]   on the road for a little family vacation, it's public,
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:41.440]   that photo post got 245 likes in just like a matter of minutes.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.000]   I had linked to via Twitter this earthquakes course
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.600]   on iTunes University.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.160]   It was like an excellent iTunes U course from Cal Academy.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.280]   And said, hey, you know, if you hear something great,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.160]   I was fooling around on my iPad when
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.120]   Daddy asks when your child asks, what's an earthquake?
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.280]   And I linked to that almost no likes,
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.480]   because I pushed it from Twitter.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.520]   So literally one like compared to nearly 300 likes for a photo.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.800]   And that seems-- anytime I post a news piece on Facebook,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.120]   very rarely do I get any kind of interest on it.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   It's usually just casual junk that gets the most response.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.000]   You have not picked your friends very well.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.120]   See, it's always our fault, isn't it?
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   Your friends are connecting to like your photos.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.400]   Socks, Robert.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   You're so wrong.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.160]   Now, here's how the filter works.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.880]   Let's get some--
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.720]   Not that Twitter is a whole lot better,
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.160]   but at least when there's an earthquake,
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.800]   I know I can go to Twitter, and I will immediately see,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.560]   you know, confirmation and information about the earthquake.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   Here's how Facebook--
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.000]   Like today on the air, today on the air--
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.840]   It's still open for us.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.880]   Let me just say this was so--
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.440]   Go ahead, Tim, let me give you a chance
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.800]   since you haven't had it been able to get a word in it twice.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.480]   I was going to say that I think Robert
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.680]   needs to start up a school for how to use Facebook,
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.040]   and then we can send all of our friends to the school.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.200]   I'm guessing tuition will be affordable,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.680]   and maybe they'll be financial and how to use it.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   But how can you--
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.600]   But if we can send all of our friends,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.360]   then maybe Facebook will be a better experience.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.400]   That's the point is how can you say something is good
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.160]   if it requires this much energy?
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.120]   Even Mark Zuckerberg himself said no one makes lists.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.000]   Because it's like driving a Ferrari.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.920]   If you don't put the work into knowing how to drive a Ferrari,
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.200]   you're going to probably wreck the car and kill yourself
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.880]   like you did this.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.240]   The CEO of Eagle Computer did it on his first day of going
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:31.600]   public.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.520]   He bought a Ferrari and killed himself the first day.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.960]   And he killed himself the first day.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   I will say, let me say this about local advertising.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.000]   You're absolutely right.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.520]   And I see a lot of small businesses
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.120]   that I work with and help them with their Facebook advertising
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.560]   and talk with them about this.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.920]   And I've done some myself, and it's been tremendous.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.360]   The amount of granularity that you can get in a community--
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.240]   so let's say I use this example.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.120]   If you're a local pet store owner,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.840]   or you have a small little pet store
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.080]   in some small town in New Jersey,
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.040]   what better way to get people foot traffic into your store
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.400]   in addition to the general traffic that's walking by,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.280]   but then by taking out a Facebook ad locally
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.080]   that targets specifically with all of the information
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.440]   you can do now with the power editor inside of Facebook
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.600]   advertising to target those people who, A, have a pet in that town,
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.800]   might be over 33 years old, so they may have some more
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.520]   disposable income than the 18-year-old.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.120]   Maybe they own their own home.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.160]   You can target all of those people specifically
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.600]   within a specific zip code.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.040]   Then you can offer them a coupon of 20% off,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.640]   or even a free toy to come in and say,
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.520]   hello for the first week while we're opening at the grand opening
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.040]   store.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.800]   Nowhere else, I think, can you get that kind of granularity
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.920]   from advertising?
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.560]   But it pays, Robert, to your point,
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.840]   to learn how to use that system instead of just putting up
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.600]   one of those generic posts to try to drive traffic to a post.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.120]   Actually, how to use the power editor within Facebook
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.640]   can be tremendous for local businesses.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.160]   Yeah, but we're talking about Facebook as end users,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.080]   not as advertisers.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.240]   I mean, here's the problem for end users for normal people, not me.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.040]   They are going to open up Facebook and Twitter and Google
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.440]   Plus on their phone, probably an Android phone,
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.560]   and they're going to compare the three.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.200]   And the three, probably of the three,
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.280]   Facebook will have some more interesting things to them.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.640]   Their friends are on it, first of all.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.440]   Their coworkers are on it.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.520]   The brands that they care about are on it.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.760]   And they've friended enough.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.040]   They've done enough to get something interesting
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.640]   on that first feed.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.920]   For me, I see it as a platform that gives me news,
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.640]   because I have notifications coming to my phone.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.280]   So if I was somewhere else and there was an earthquake,
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.160]   I would see it on Twitter and Facebook in real time.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.880]   And I would know who's the most credible and authoritative
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.560]   person talking about that.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.880]   Normal people don't care about that.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.760]   They just want to see, do you have any baby photos on the feed?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.360]   You go over to Twitter and they follow the Kardashians,
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.440]   and that's all they see, right?
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.960]   I like audio in our chatroom.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.920]   He said, Facebook is a data mining tool
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.160]   that's trying to socially engineer
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.920]   and then monetize our relationships.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.520]   I feel socially engineered every time I use Facebook.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.720]   I absolutely feel manipulated.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.240]   We're always socially engineered.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.280]   Do you all not feel manipulated every time you use Facebook?
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.560]   Am I wrong?
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.920]   Don't you feel a little manipulated when you visit this book?
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.000]   I've gotten over that feeling.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.840]   The feeling I have.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.440]   By suppressing it.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.240]   Robert, you know you're being manipulated.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.840]   You just compartmentalize it.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.760]   I'm using it to make a news feed for myself,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.760]   which is the best news feed by far.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.840]   It has less noise than Twitter has,
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.400]   and it has certainly less noise than Google+.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.520]   And I can prove this if you come over here.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.080]   If you follow, wait a minute, Robert,
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.920]   what if you follow the right people on Twitter?
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.560]   Wouldn't you have a great news feed?
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.880]   I mean, it isn't a case that--
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   Let me show you, let me show you Twitter.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.280]   If you put that kind of effort in a Twitter,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.400]   you would also have,
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.880]   I have put that kind of effort in there.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.480]   The problem I have with Facebook is it's opaque.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.840]   I don't know what Facebook's doing.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.320]   With Twitter, if I follow somebody else,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.640]   I'll see there's stuff, all of it.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.680]   If I don't, I won't.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.200]   And I think that you can cultivate a Twitter feed
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.360]   in a way that you can't cultivate a Facebook feed
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.200]   because it's opaque.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.760]   You don't know what Facebook is doing with your signals.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.520]   Nope.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.600]   And that's where you have to get into
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.400]   just letting the engine do something for you.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.760]   Twitter, yes, will show you every post,
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.360]   but I'm sorry, there's a lot of news noise in this feed.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.520]   Right?
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.160]   Robert, Robert has drank the Kool-Aid, hasn't he?
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   I have told you, not some people named it.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.000]   How many times--
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.840]   You haven't studied this.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.680]   The last time you were with Zuck,
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.600]   did he give you anything to eat or drink?
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.960]   That's funny.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.160]   Mushrooms of any kind?
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.360]   Hey, Evan Williams bought me a whiskey at the Ritz one time, so--
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.040]   Yeah, Evan isn't even involved with Twitter anymore.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.440]   I think Tim Stevens is wisely staying out of this.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.160]   He says, I don't want to talk about this.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.680]   I think Clayton and I should maybe branch up
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.360]   and do a separate show at this point.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.640]   We'll do a Twitter show.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.200]   All right.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.920]   I do have a secret.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.640]   I do have a secret today on the year during the earthquake.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.680]   I mean, I--
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.800]   Four hour show.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.320]   I was on the air this morning at 6 AM Eastern time,
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.240]   so about 3 AM local time there in Petaluma.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.760]   And I went right to Twitter about 3 20
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.160]   after we were getting word that we had come out
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.400]   of a commercial break and we had a break in with breaking news
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.080]   that there was a 6.0 earthquake in California.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.520]   So immediately, I think about my in-laws
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.840]   that live right there, but also jumped on Twitter
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.920]   to see what the news was and if there were any images being
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.560]   shared at that hour, it's certainly dark.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.040]   So getting cameras into that area was going to be a problem.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.880]   But we were able to pull up images.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.320]   I was able to get great local reports from people
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.280]   who were right in downtown Napa, who
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.440]   were seeing people that were trapped, buildings that
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.280]   had collapsed, maybe 30 minutes before we
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.760]   were able to get actual cameras on the ground there.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.400]   But it was great to be able to supplement that reporting
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.240]   live on the air from credible sources.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.560]   And some of our reporters who weren't
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.520]   able to actually get boots on the ground in that area,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.080]   one of our reporters lives right in Napa.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.920]   He grew up there and we were able to see reports and photos
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.600]   that he was posting to Twitter and pull those up
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.680]   right on the show.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.920]   And using Stream Board, a great app that Robert, I think,
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.160]   told me about last year, to be able to watch
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.200]   all of the commentary you can follow specific hashtags
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.800]   and see what's being said.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.480]   You can then make it more granular
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   to follow just like verified accounts or people
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.960]   with a certain number of followers.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.720]   So it might be a news organization or something like that.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   But it was a great source of news on the air.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.560]   And I think I have a tendency to always
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.400]   go to Twitter when there's pieces of breaking news
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.320]   and information where you want to see the conversation.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.360]   I never really see it unfolding on Facebook.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:38.880]   No, I don't.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.840]   But maybe it's my fault.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.280]   Or I might say Google Plus.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.480]   And I love Google Plus for certain things.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.920]   But I went to Google Plus just to see
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.800]   if anybody was talking about the earthquake there.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.240]   And there really was.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.160]   You guys haven't built the structures that
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.080]   will bring you what you want.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.400]   I have a list of news of mainstream news here.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.640]   Let me show it to you.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.800]   Robert, I understand.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.520]   You don't need to belabor this.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.080]   If you put the energy in--
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.760]   You can see all the stuff.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.240]   Because here's why I don't do it.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.680]   It's not exactly clear what you're going to get.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   It is to me now.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.600]   I think it becomes very clear on the side.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.160]   And somebody asked me, what is the reason I'm doing this?
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.200]   I want the best of breed of the thieves.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.880]   Period.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.760]   Mark Cantor, by the way, who started Macromedia, which
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.440]   became Macromide and just commented
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.000]   that you guys aren't getting it because you don't use it.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.080]   And I use Facebook every day with revulsion.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.600]   Not with these lists.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.120]   Nausea in my mouth.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.280]   Look at this list.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.080]   Hold on a second.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.400]   I have a list that I built.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.720]   A 537 tech journalist in the world.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.760]   You can see Danny Sullivan's there, all the usual players.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.520]   And I can scroll through here.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.840]   And I just get tech news.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.160]   There's no cat photos here.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.440]   There's no personal memes.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.000]   It's everything happening in the tech industry right now.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.280]   And it's better than what I see on Twitter for the general part.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.200]   Now, breaking news and searching--
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.840]   Absolutely, Twitter is still there.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.240]   And I keep Twitter on my screen most of the time.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.520]   So it's not really a Twitter versus Facebook thing,
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.440]   but Google+ is falling way better.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.200]   How many of the 1 billion Facebook users are doing this?
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.800]   None.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.120]   OK, thank you.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.200]   But I am.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.880]   And first of all, if we had a show eight years ago,
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.640]   there was nobody on Facebook.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.120]   None of us use Facebook.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.400]   So I just think that already means a bullish argument.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.720]   Let's say I go to a news organization's Facebook page.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.320]   And right at the top, they've got the big cover art.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.000]   If I like that page, what the hell does that do?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.800]   If I follow that page, what the hell does that do?
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.240]   No one knows because it's opaque.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.040]   And Facebook is explicitly keeping you from knowing that.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.840]   I'll tell you, first of all, if you're
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.520]   a person, Robert Scobolio, the port,
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.920]   you have a personal profile.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.200]   And you can turn on a feature called follow.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.520]   So the foundation of Facebook is a friend.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.560]   That means I want to see some of your stuff,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.200]   and you want to see some of my stuff.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.800]   That's what a friend on Facebook means.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.160]   Not a friend in real life, but a friend on Facebook.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.480]   If I don't want to see your stuff, I don't friend you,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.960]   and I make you follow me.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.920]   Following me means you see some of my stuff,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.440]   and I don't see much, if any, of your stuff.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.240]   If you have a brand page and you click like on it,
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.360]   it adds that like to your like area on your profile.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.280]   So everybody can see that you like target
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.800]   or like Formula One racing or something like that, right?
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.040]   And you'll see a few of those posts on your main feed as well.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.720]   It also automatically adds them to this list over here
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:51.040]   called pages and public figures.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.680]   And this is everything that I've liked.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.240]   And you notice the quality is way lower than the main feed.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.920]   There's a lot of memes, there's a lot of cat photos on here,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.040]   there's a lot of personal photos.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.400]   At some point I would love to get you to do this.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.440]   The problem is you're scrolling,
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.200]   gross scrolls by so fast, we can't see the result.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.440]   And it does seem like this is a technique
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.200]   that requires a PhD in Facebook.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.080]   So I'm not kidding, I want you to come over
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.120]   and spend some time, we'll do a special,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.720]   and how to scobilize your feed.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.200]   And I'd be very curious, I'd be willing to try it.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   We have somebody in the chatroom, KB Shriram,
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.600]   who is actually interesting.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   He's written a script to use Facebook's knowledge graph API,
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.400]   or Facebook graph API, using some Java code.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.720]   He downloads just what he wants from Facebook.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.160]   He actually doesn't ever go to Facebook.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.320]   This is how I want to use Facebook.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.840]   So I'm going to download his code and see if he can.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.760]   There's a lot of ways to use all these tools.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.320]   It's interesting that Facebook's--
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.200]   it's pretty clear, and we're going to move on,
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.400]   because this is incredibly boring to most people.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.000]   The chatroom's having fun with it.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   It's very clear--
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.800]   Because we're all nerds in the chatroom.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.720]   Thank you, chatroom.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.280]   And by the way, a number of people pointed out,
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.240]   Linda.com has a tutorial on getting Facebook running.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.280]   My guess is it's not anywhere near as bizarre and sophisticated
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.800]   as what Robert is doing.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.520]   And as you say, Robert, I doubt many people, if any,
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.240]   are doing this on Facebook.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.360]   I've put thousands of hours in the Facebook.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.000]   See, that's just the last thing in the world
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.080]   I'd ever want to do.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.480]   It's like getting an apple, too.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   It's interesting.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.000]   It's interesting.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.800]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.880]   You're creating.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.560]   If at a Ferrari, you're going to need to go to a race track
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.520]   and learn how to talk.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.480]   Yeah, but Ferrari doesn't keep moving the brake pedal.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.600]   And the problem with spending this kind of energy
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.680]   in Facebook is tomorrow they could change it all.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.920]   And everything you've done will stop working.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.200]   Absolutely, because they've done that before.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.800]   But you also write about Google+ could do the same thing.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.360]   Google+ could do.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.080]   Anybody could.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.560]   That's why.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.640]   But I'm not going to put 1,000 hours into any of these,
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.880]   because that could be tomorrow completely wasted energy.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:13.560]   Well, I find them to be where the people are,
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.000]   and therefore where the information is.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.440]   No, I know that.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.360]   What about their strategy, which it looks to be clear now
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.400]   that Facebook-- and I think this is brilliant--
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.280]   has the strategy.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.640]   They don't really care if you spend most of your time
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.560]   at the blue page.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.000]   In fact, I noticed my daughter--
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.920]   I'm watching her.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.440]   She's 22 using her smartphone.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.360]   She goes to Facebook because she's got groups there,
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.800]   her dorm group, and her friends from one school
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.520]   and another school.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.560]   And she'll check up on that.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.840]   And then she goes to Instagram to see what the picture is there.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.040]   She probably isn't fully aware of the fact
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.080]   that she's never left Facebook by going to Instagram.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.400]   It's just another branch.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.600]   Mike Elgin, our news director, is positive.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.640]   And I think he's right that in a few years,
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.080]   Facebook may have 100 apps.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.560]   And they don't care because what's very interesting
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.480]   is to watch my daughter not really ever leave Facebook,
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.600]   but in fact use Messenger, use Facebook,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.480]   and Messenger being extracted from Facebook
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.800]   now as a separate app.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.720]   Use WhatsApp.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.440]   She said in Mexico she used WhatsApp.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.120]   Everybody there used WhatsApp.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.840]   She never left a Facebook ecosystem.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.040]   And yet it seemed like she was.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.560]   I think that to me is a very smart move on Facebook.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:29.080]   I predict that they're working on a work version of Facebook.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.360]   I don't know if they'll call it Facebook.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.760]   They might call it something like Workbook or something.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.360]   But Zuckerberg is running Facebook
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.880]   on a version of Facebook that we can't see.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.040]   And I find that's interesting.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.240]   And I'm sure he's working on the search feature
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.040]   that Twitter has.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.960]   And my former boss is at Twitter.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.120]   So he's working hard to make sure that people
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.560]   stay addicted to Twitter and don't go to Facebook.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.400]   Twitter has its own structural issues.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.600]   There's the troll issue because it's so easy at Twitter
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.560]   to create a phony account.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.000]   It's whack-a-mole to stop trolls.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.360]   And we've seen a lot of people of late
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.320]   really complain about that on Twitter.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.800]   The one thing you did say that was very astute.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.720]   They are changing the rules every week.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.800]   Every week I notice something changes about the news feed.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.200]   It generally gets better.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.480]   But sometimes it gets worse in a little bit in a little way.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.640]   But the trend line is clear.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.520]   It's going like this and it's getting better.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.840]   It's dramatically better than it was a year ago.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.800]   Partly because I put in more work on it
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.160]   and given it more signal.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.360]   Also because the feed is changing
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.920]   and what they want through the feed is changing.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.800]   And they do have the ability to turn you off.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.440]   They do have the ability to turn up the knob on you
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.960]   and get you more distribution.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.480]   Or post happy thoughts so you'll have happy posts.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.960]   And that's why they might turn you up.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.160]   They might say, you know, everybody's feed
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.000]   doesn't have enough happiness right now.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.760]   Everybody's talking about a tragedy
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.160]   while they might look for somebody who has happiness.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.960]   How come you're sitting there in Fox and Friends
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.600]   you don't pull up a Facebook feed?
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.080]   That's a great question.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.560]   So I do, when we ask a question of the day of a story
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.160]   that might be controversial and we want to see
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   where 50/50 response, half the people torn by this story
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.440]   or this story.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.280]   And I like to see the responses from people.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.840]   And we post a story on our Facebook page.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.120]   You know, we'll get thousands of responses during the show.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.160]   And it's great to see all those responses.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.040]   But I don't go there for news, typically breaking news
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.680]   during the show.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.040]   It just doesn't seem--
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:40.560]   You don't know.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.040]   I don't ever see it in my feed.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.880]   So I guess I don't-- because I don't see it in my feed,
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.680]   I don't think to go there.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.760]   When I go on Facebook, the stuff that I end up seeing
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.400]   is old, you know, not old information,
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.200]   but it certainly doesn't feel like it's breaking.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.320]   Robert would say that's your fault.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.960]   Well, no, all you have to do is follow my tech news list.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.440]   I've done that right, right?
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.400]   So you don't have to do the work.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.160]   Tim, what's on my tech news list?
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.280]   So for instance, Robert, if I post something--
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.080]   I don't know if I'm in your tech news list.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.720]   You sure are.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.520]   But if I post something in there, for instance,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.040]   I posted this Kickstarter project on this awesome butter
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.040]   knife that I want, and I want it right now.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.240]   And I flipped it from Flipboard,
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.640]   because I added it to my technology magazine on Flipboard.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.800]   And it's awesome.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.880]   So will that because it's--
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.320]   I mean, how does it-- you say your technology feed
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.560]   is fantastic, but how does your technology feed
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.720]   no to remove pictures of my kids and just put my butter knife?
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.960]   It does.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.240]   Somehow, it's magic.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.000]   Look, do you see kids photos?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.120]   I mean, there's Dennis--
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.120]   I've seen no kids photos.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.120]   There's no--
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.120]   There's no--
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.000]   I'm just fascinated by why that does it now.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.080]   It knows when you talk about tech
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.360]   versus when you tag your kids in the photo.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.280]   It's exactly how it works.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.080]   I feel like no social media right now.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.400]   I mean, look at my tech feed just right now.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400]   Seen that?
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   Hackers.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.600]   What are the dates and times of them?
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.000]   Some calendar.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.880]   Are those all--
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.080]   24 minutes away.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:04.600]   13 minutes.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.840]   Those are all pretty current.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.680]   Technology blogs on the news.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.080]   Are you sorting that by recent?
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.200]   Or are you sorting it by--
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.240]   No, no, I am just clicking on the list.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.080]   When it's a list, it's everything.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.000]   It's not filtering.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.440]   It's unfiltered, so it would be chronological.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.520]   It's a code design.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.280]   So it's chronological.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.000]   Here's Moto.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.480]   OK.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.520]   Facebook Newswire.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.040]   Well, I started this by saying Twitter won the earthquake.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.560]   But--
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.600]   Here's the first thing that Jeremiah, who's an analyst--
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.080]   That's only how she did it wrong.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.400]   --has a wedding photo.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.160]   See what I've done?
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   It's a wedding photo.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.200]   That's exciting.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.360]   You're holding Facebook wrong.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120]   It's an engine.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.520]   Somebody actually had an interesting call
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.440]   on the radio show today because a guy said,
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.960]   all of a sudden, I have a very limited bandwidth
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.920]   because I'm using a MIFI.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.360]   And all of a sudden, my way over the cap--
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.000]   and I realized it was because of the auto play
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.440]   videos on my Facebook stream.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.120]   How do I turn that off?
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.120]   There is a way I found the setting.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.160]   But that's interesting.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.240]   I never think of that.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.520]   But that is probably a significant increase in bandwidth use.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.960]   Yeah, they said that they would basically
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.400]   do some caching on mobile devices when you're on Wi-Fi.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.720]   But if you're using a MIFI, then it
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.760]   really has no idea whether or not you're actually
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.680]   on a local Wi-Fi connection or a remote one.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.320]   So yeah, that's very unfortunate.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.560]   The chat room is getting bored now.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.760]   Oh, they've been bored since day one.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.720]   That's a congenital condition.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.560]   They're all nerds.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.720]   They want to talk about real--
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.200]   We're all ADD.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.160]   The truth is, I don't mind going on a little bit on this.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.960]   A, because you and I have been offline talking about this.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.160]   And I'm sincere in saying I would like you to come up,
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.080]   and we'll do a special on how to scobilize your Facebook.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.600]   And you can tell-- you can coach me.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.920]   And I would love to see this.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.200]   At Rackspace, I'm having these arguments with my boss.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.240]   He's really studying LinkedIn.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.200]   And he sees a lot of value in LinkedIn.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:52.800]   And--
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.240]   I think what I might come away with
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.040]   is that, look, no social network is perfect for any one
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.280]   purpose.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.840]   But each of us has--
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.720]   I think most people now use all as many as possible
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.600]   in different ways and are satisfied in different ways,
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.280]   right?
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.200]   Three or four.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.120]   I don't think so.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.040]   Most people have Snapchat and Facebook and LinkedIn,
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.160]   maybe Google+, but--
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.720]   I actually re-upped at LinkedIn.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.120]   I had deleted my LinkedIn at cats.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.520]   I thought--
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.000]   I think people aren't on a lot of social networks are weird.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Well, they think you're weird, Robert.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Exactly.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.400]   It's pretty much mutual.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.240]   We're going to take a break.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.280]   Robert Scoville is here.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.880]   Tim Stevens is here.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.080]   We got Clayton Morris out at Lake Tinky Wink.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.520]   How's the Read Quick app doing?
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.320]   Doing well?
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.240]   It was doing well.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.600]   It was actually chosen as the app of the week a few weeks
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.400]   ago for a week.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.680]   So that was insane.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.160]   Do you get paid even though they're giving it away
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.440]   when they do that?
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.360]   No, no.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.720]   But to have many, many millions of people
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.040]   download the app and people all over the world
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.520]   write in just wonderful things.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.520]   I mean, I was blown away by the response from people, really,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:06.880]   really.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.520]   It was just such a special week in seeing people who maybe
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.960]   couldn't afford the app before saying,
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.880]   I couldn't afford it before, but this really
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.400]   has changed the way that I read the papers for school now.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.200]   And it was really, really touching,
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.320]   because I built it as, as you know, just as a scratch your own itch
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.160]   thing for myself.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.960]   And it just to see, like, millions of responses from people
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.400]   was just so--
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.280]   Are you going to pull up Kevin Rose?
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.160]   Are you going to drop out of the television business
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.400]   and go whole hog on apps?
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.360]   No, no, no.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:38.880]   Do you see Kevin?
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.200]   Did that?
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.040]   He's kind of stepped back at Google Ventures.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.680]   He's building an app.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.480]   He just post pictures last night of them staying up late,
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.360]   writing something.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.040]   We don't know what.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.160]   No, I loved television since I was a little kid sneaking
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.680]   downstairs and watching Carson and Letterman.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.280]   So it's in my blood to be intelligent.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.480]   I built Read Quick as a way to supplement and read news
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.600]   fast for my job.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.640]   So it's really a supplement for that.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.000]   But it's doing really well.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.400]   I'm really curious.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.840]   And we can talk about this later, just
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.880]   with the different size iPhones, how this--
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.760]   I was thinking about this this week, really,
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.240]   what is the definition of the universal app anymore
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:19.040]   with the different phone sizes, 5.5 inch screen, 4.7 inch
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.440]   iPad mini, iPad Air.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.720]   So what does that mean anymore?
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.400]   What features do you not enable for a larger screen, smaller
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.360]   screen, so kind of going through that right now?
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.520]   That's a good topic for when we come back.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.440]   We are getting close to--
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.880]   we think, to an iPhone launch.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.800]   We wonder what September 9th will bring.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.040]   Let's talk about it.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.080]   But first a word from Gazelle.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.520]   If you've got an iPhone, I got a tip for you.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.640]   It is likely we're going to see new phones from Motorola
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.400]   next week, a new iPhone in two weeks, perhaps new phones,
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.000]   the Galaxy Note 4 in the next couple of weeks.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.840]   EFA is coming up, and Berlin will probably see new stuff there.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.560]   And I could tell you one thing for sure.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.080]   The minute they announce a new iPhone,
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.520]   your current iPhone is going to drop in value.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.800]   It's dropping right now.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.280]   Go to Gazelle and lock that value in.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.880]   This is your chance to get some money for your old stuff
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.640]   to help pay for the new stuff, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.360]   You very likely have a few other gadgets in your gadget
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.040]   drawer that you're not using.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.760]   Think of it as bundles of greenbacks in that drawer,
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.800]   just sitting there collecting dust.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.920]   This could be money.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.600]   Right now, by the way, when you lock in the price
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.720]   for your iPhone, they're going to extend it.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   Normally, it's 30 days.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   They're going to extend it all the way to October 10th,
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.080]   giving you time no matter when the ship date is
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.680]   on the new iPhone, no matter how long the lines are,
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.920]   to get that new iPhone, get your data transferred over,
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.800]   and then ship the iPhone back.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.560]   But that price will be the price from today.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.960]   And that's the beauty part.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.040]   Go to G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com and sell your cell phone,
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.920]   your tablet, your iPad, your Surface, your Apple computer,
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.080]   your Samsung, your Galaxy.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.800]   All of that, they'll buy it.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.280]   And there's three ways you can get paid.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.840]   You can get a check.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.200]   If you just want, you know, the standard just
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.640]   will send you a check.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.400]   You can get a PayPal credit.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   That's a little more quick.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   And if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon,
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.520]   I'd get the Amazon gift card,
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.360]   because they bumped that up by 5%.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.360]   Let's see, but let's just see what an old iPad mini
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.040]   is worth today.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.800]   My 5 iPad mini, $16, $110.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.160]   That's like just sitting in the drawer.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.120]   Wouldn't you, you know, get this,
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.200]   and you're locking it in for 30 days.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.800]   Actually, you're locking it in if it's an iPhone
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.160]   until October 10th.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.480]   Now, when you get the new phone
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.200]   and you're ready to ship the old phone in,
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.800]   check out, and they'll send you a box prepaid postage.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.440]   If you forget to wipe the data, don't worry.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.200]   They'll do it for you, then they'll send you the money.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.480]   It's a really great way to sell your gadgets.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.320]   The fast and simple way.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.480]   If you're upgrading to a new iPad, new MacBook,
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.600]   do it with Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.880]   But again, do not delay,
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.520]   'cause those gadgets are not gaining in value.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.760]   And the minute the announcement happens,
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.160]   they're gonna plummet.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.760]   What?
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.200]   5S with worth how much unlocked?
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.560]   300 bucks.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.860]   I'm gonna make money.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.480]   I'm gonna make money.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.560]   A new iPhone, we're gonna see,
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.760]   you know, I'm thinking the rumors are congealing.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.560]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.600]   It's probably not a very auspicious image in your mind,
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.480]   but the rumors feel like they're kind of
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.280]   converging maybe a better word on two iPhones,
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.880]   a 4.7 inch iPhone and a 5.5.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.000]   You think we'll see both Tim on September 9th?
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.760]   Yeah, I'm inclined to think that we will see
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.680]   both devices on that date.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.760]   I don't know whether they'll launch simultaneously.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.200]   There's definitely a chance that Apple will say
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.280]   one's gonna be out next week
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.320]   and the other one maybe will be a month later.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.120]   Certainly we've heard issues of low yields
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.920]   on some of their display componentry
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.200]   that might be causing some shortages
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.960]   when it comes to supply.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.640]   But short of that, I think they would probably like
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.800]   to have both launched simultaneously.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.360]   And it'll be interesting to see how that goes,
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   how they message the two, how they differentiate the two,
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.000]   because they did launch, of course, the 5C,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.840]   not that long ago.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.360]   And the messaging there was very much,
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.600]   you know, this is not a cheaper phone.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.160]   This is just a different type of phone.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.480]   But I think that these are gonna have to be
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.760]   a little bit more focused devices
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.200]   when it comes to the messaging,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.040]   a little bit more focused in terms of usage
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.400]   and maybe aiming to a professional
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.960]   versus just casual users and that kind of thing.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.480]   So I think we'll see some interesting marketing
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.680]   and some interesting advertising.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.360]   And I'm curious to see what the message is
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.720]   on September 9th.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.600]   Reuters says because of the new display,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.400]   the new in-cell touch screens they're using,
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.120]   they're having a hard time getting those from LG and Sharp.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:40.800]   And that's one concern that might hold up either
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.120]   or both of the phones.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.800]   This makes it a little bit thinner
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.860]   because the in-cell touch panel eliminates some layers.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:53.600]   - Every year, talk about how the newest device
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.440]   will be delayed from Apple and they're never right.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.280]   (laughs)
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.000]   - Yeah, I mean, I understand these rumors
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.440]   are complete speculation in most cases.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.080]   Although I do trust the supply rumors a little bit more
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   because frankly it's hard to keep a lid on the suppliers.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.480]   Even Foxconn is starting to leak
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.840]   a little bit about this stuff.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.680]   So.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.960]   - Are you gonna go with, I mean, my sources are telling me
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.520]   we're gonna see two phones for sure.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.360]   - You've had some very good sources in the past, Lee.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.200]   - Right.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.800]   - Are you still in touch with those folks?
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.880]   - Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.520]   And I really think we're gonna see two new phones.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.160]   The question for me is whether or not,
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.600]   I don't know, I mean, walk around with the,
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.000]   just to test obviously the larger--
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.640]   - That's the 1520, the Nokia 1520 there.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:50.120]   And, you know, to me it's just too big.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.560]   But I'm not a senior citizen yet,
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.400]   so maybe I would enjoy--
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.240]   - I am.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.080]   - Much larger.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.560]   - And I like it, but you like the note.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.760]   You like the note, right?
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.400]   - I have that 1520, I loved it until I bricked it.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.880]   - I'm hearing that obviously the screen resolution
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.040]   on the larger phone is gonna be much better.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.240]   - Well, actually that's a good question.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.080]   What is the resolution gonna be on the 47 and the 55?
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.680]   Do we know-- - What I'm hearing,
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.000]   what I'm hearing from a couple of sources
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.360]   is three times retina on the larger screen.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.200]   - That's not, that's the pixels per inch.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.520]   - Right.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.240]   - You're saying three times that would be like 600?
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.880]   - And Gruber actually had a great post about it
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.720]   the other day too, where he broke it down.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.840]   And this is jiving with what I've been hearing
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:42.840]   as well, 461 PPI, so on the 5.5 inch.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:47.760]   So like, what did he say, 2208?
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.600]   Is that right?
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.920]   2208 times 1248 on the 5.5 inch screen.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.760]   - And he did a little bit of that one.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.360]   - The 5.5 is 2208 by 1242.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.200]   - Yeah.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.920]   - And that would be four to 61 pixels per inch.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.160]   Ironically, more than the smaller iPhones,
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.360]   you'd think those would have a higher density.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.760]   The 4.7 would be 1334 by 750.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   Is this because it's doubled and tripled?
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.640]   Is that why they come up with this?
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.960]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.400]   I'm terrible with math, I have to get out my abacus,
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.280]   but the amount of time that John's been going through
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.680]   all of the different variables, but it's jiving in--
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.320]   - John used to get ready for this,
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.720]   the Pythagorean theorem.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.560]   - Right.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.680]   - I remember the name, I have no idea.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.800]   Is that A squared plus B squared equals C squared?
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.640]   - What is that?
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.480]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.320]   - Okay.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.160]   Well, that sure helps me.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.000]   - Right.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.960]   - Did Gruber have to go back and get his eighth grade math book
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.800]   or what?
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.640]   - He must have.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.800]   - Wow.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.640]   That's impressive.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.280]   - But it makes a serious questions though, I think too,
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.600]   when I'm thinking about some of the different apps
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.280]   that when I think about Readquick for instance,
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.000]   about well, there's a difference,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.200]   we made it a universal app for a reason, right?
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.800]   But there's different versions of it.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.560]   So what does it mean to have the app running on an iPad,
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.640]   an iPad Air, an iPad Mini?
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.520]   Then what does it mean to have it on such a small device
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.840]   when you're in line at a Starbucks?
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.840]   Well, then what does it now mean to have
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.520]   on a 5.5 inch screen?
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.880]   What sorts of buttons can we employ there?
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.400]   What sorts of things will pop up?
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.720]   What sorts of tools will pop up on that screen?
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:30.000]   And I know that obviously Apple seems to be pushing
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.200]   developers in that direction to really consider
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.440]   these different screen sizes when they're building
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.600]   their apps tall.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:40.840]   And I know there's a bit of rumors out there about.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.360]   - Go ahead.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.120]   - Oh, I was gonna say with split screen apps now,
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.200]   let me see what the surface is.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.400]   - Well, we know iOS 8 will have that.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.240]   - Right.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:56.080]   So a lot of developer questions I'm having
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.800]   just a couple of weeks.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.280]   - His point is that if you make the 4.7 inch,
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.000]   1334 by 750, that's double the pixel density.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.400]   Doubles easy to do for a developer.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.320]   You wanna do multiples.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.960]   You don't wanna do it by 1.68 times because then that's tough.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.940]   The 5.5 inch he's thinking will be three times the density.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.680]   And I'll read you his reasoning.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.080]   First, I'm assuming that both the 4.7 and 5.5 inch rumors
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:26.920]   are true.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.520]   Second, I'm assuming a 69 aspect ratio for both displays.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.360]   Given these assumptions and the Pythagorean theorem,
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.080]   it's easy to create a spreadsheet model
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.040]   that gives you the pixels per inch resolution
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.520]   for a given pixel count.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.320]   Given the height and width and pixels we could solve
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.360]   for the diagonal and pixels, A squared plus B squared
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.520]   equals C squared, starting with value.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.440]   Oh, forget it.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.960]   He's just showing off now.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.120]   Anyway, but that makes sense
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.080]   because you wanna make it easy for developers.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:59.080]   And did you see the Android fragmentation graphic
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.160]   that came out this week?
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.600]   And it shows you why, what Apple's trying to avoid.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.120]   There are so many different Android devices
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:14.560]   and so many different, this is the graphic for Android users.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.080]   This is from OpenSignal.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.320]   This looks like my hard drive.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.120]   - Defragging. - Defragging.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.560]   Each rectangle represents a unique Android device.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.520]   According to OpenSignal,
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.200]   which makes software for mobile devices
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.240]   that track cell phone towers and Wi-Fi signals.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.840]   So they're getting this data from the field.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.840]   There are, get this, 18,796 different unique Android devices.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:44.680]   Imagine, do you do read quick for Android?
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.520]   - No.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.360]   (laughs)
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.520]   - You know why? - Now you know why.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.760]   - I've been talking back and forth with it for months.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:52.040]   I mean, people ask for it, but I just--
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:56.000]   - Look at this, this is the various Android screen sizes
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.480]   that you have to deal with.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.200]   They're all over the place.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.920]   Now iPad and iPhone, it's very linear.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.240]   And this is the key.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.360]   If you add the new iPhone, it goes right in here in the box.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:14.360]   It's not nearly so crazy.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.920]   Android versions over time, these graphs are just bizarre.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.680]   91% of iOS devices run the latest version.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.880]   So that's also a simplification for you.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.040]   - There's a graph missing there
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.480]   and that is Android sales versus iOS.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.320]   (laughs)
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.760]   That would tell a very different story, wouldn't it?
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.160]   - Yeah.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.440]   Android has 80% market share globally.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.600]   80%.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.680]   And frankly, I use, I'm using this OnePlus One, I love it.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.800]   And this is a five, I don't know what,
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.000]   this is five, five and a half.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.240]   Can't remember.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.080]   It's big.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:48.320]   - What is that one?
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.600]   - This is the crazy one where they wanted women
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.160]   to put tattoos on their butt.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.240]   You know what, the OnePlus One?
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.680]   (laughs)
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:59.840]   - Did that marketing campaign work for them?
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.200]   - Did not work for them, no.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.920]   (laughs)
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.680]   However, this is the irony of it.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.320]   If it's $350 for 64 gig and it's a really great phone.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.520]   I don't know.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.560]   I am very intrigued by the new iPhone
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.480]   and I probably, I know I will get one.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.320]   I'm actually, there are things that have been keeping me
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.800]   from, that got me off the iPhone
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.320]   over the last couple of years or screen size
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.240]   and the God awful keyboard
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.360]   and both of these are gonna be solved in the new iPhone.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.200]   You'll be able to put it forward.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.040]   - A couple of questions I have too,
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.520]   is will there be any difference between the two devices
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.640]   for features?
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.840]   Because they're both being released at the same time,
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   will there be a wow feature in the larger iPhone?
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.320]   I'm hearing better battery,
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.640]   but that's to be expected with a larger phone.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.600]   But you know what I'm saying?
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.840]   Like the 4S had Siri, the 4 did not,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.880]   but because they're being released at the same time,
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.400]   probably the same camera,
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.040]   everything else will be the same.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.600]   My question though,
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.640]   will one of them have larger storage?
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:04.680]   Will that be an incentive to get the larger iPhone
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.840]   because it has an increased storage capacity
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.920]   for business or something?
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   If you're on the road and you need that extra storage,
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.760]   I don't know,
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.920]   but everything else probably will be the same.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.400]   - Thoughts, Tim Stevens?
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.520]   You covered this for years, I think gadget.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.600]   - Yeah, yeah, we've been waiting for 128 gig phones
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.440]   for a long time now
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.360]   and this will certainly be a good time for them to do that.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.400]   - Battery life, absolutely.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.800]   I would definitely expect a much bigger battery life
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.400]   from the larger device.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.840]   I'm curious what the advertiser does.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.440]   You know, they've always pretty much advertised
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.840]   the same battery life for each new generation of iPhone.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.720]   It'll be interesting, I think, good for them
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.080]   to maybe finally step away from that
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.320]   and show something a little bit different
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   with these new larger devices.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.160]   And Pixel Density does play a role in that too.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   The R Pixel Density usually need a more powerful backlight
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.040]   which then decreases your battery life.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.080]   So that's probably another issue
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.240]   that they're trying to deal with.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.360]   If indeed those display yields are indeed lower
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.240]   than they are supposed to be.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.800]   But I think better life should be better.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.000]   Pixel Density higher is great, of course.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.200]   In terms of features, I mean,
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.800]   there's been a lot of talk about NFC now,
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.800]   which is interesting, of course, you know, that's something
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:05.640]   that-- - That surprised me.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:09.560]   We saw a schematic that showed more RAM and NFC.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.040]   Now, whether, again, we don't know if it's true or not.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.440]   But that would be a bit of a turnaround for Apple.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.840]   - It definitely would be, but that could be something
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.480]   that maybe we'd only see on the larger phone.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:24.000]   But then we saw a bit of a turnaround on USB 3.0 as well.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.520]   So maybe this is sort of thing here.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.360]   - Yeah, I'm hearing NFC as well.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:33.400]   And I had heard that Apple wanted to do,
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.080]   you know, a significant move for past book last year.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.280]   But really wasn't ready for prime time
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.440]   with what they wanted to do with NFC.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.120]   So it'll be interesting to see, you know,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.040]   perhaps who takes the stage with Apple
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.720]   or at least who's featured with Apple.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.200]   Because, you know, I think about NFC
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.520]   and I think about the stores that I would like to see
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.240]   involved with an NFC play.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.520]   I hate carrying my wallet.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.520]   You know, I've got that giant, you know,
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.600]   like a stands-asized wallet.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.800]   And, you know, now when I go into the city,
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.840]   I just take my phone and I can buy my train ticket
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.860]   using my phone.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:13.240]   I, you know, if I wanna get Starbucks, I use my phone.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.240]   - Robert, you're an I-beacon fan.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:18.640]   Is there anything I-beacon can do
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.680]   that NFC can or vice versa?
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.480]   - Yeah, NFC needs to be close.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.840]   I-beacon can be seen 100 meters away if I remember.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.800]   - Apple's clearly been on I-beacon.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.560]   Why would they do NFC?
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:35.440]   - For, because it's cheap and it's deployed
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.800]   in a lot of places and they're wanting
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.080]   to get into the payments business.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.920]   They want to get into Square's business.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.560]   So you're gonna take your iPhone into some places.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.520]   - It's funny 'cause Square's getting out of that business
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.360]   by the way, Square.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.200]   - Right.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.880]   Losing 100 million dollars.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.160]   I don't know how to lose it.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.320]   - They've already got your credit card.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.480]   So that's the thing with Apple.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.840]   I mean, think about how many purchase you have.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.240]   - Apple has everybody's credit card.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.080]   - Right.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.320]   - Yeah, we should tell people what I-beacon is.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.680]   It's a little radio that costs less than $10.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.920]   It spits three numbers into the air every second
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.560]   and your phone, whether it be Android or iPhone,
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.040]   can see how close it is.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.680]   Your iPhone, if you have an iPhone,
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.240]   it has one of these radios in it.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:17.240]   It's not on, but the I-beacon software can turn it on.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:22.800]   So if you get a new app from Target or Macy's,
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.560]   or if you go to Coachella next year,
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.400]   they had beacons on the field there.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.160]   So as you walk around the field,
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.040]   stuff can happen on your iPhone
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.360]   that can show you where you are.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   - It feels to me like Apple could do everything
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.800]   that you can do with an AFC.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.360]   They could do with I-beacon ranging and so forth.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.040]   You can turn it on your iPhone.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.240]   You can turn it on I-beacon.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.000]   They kind of own I-beacon.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.400]   Why would they even consider NFC?
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:51.000]   - Security, I mean, I have to think something with touch ID
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.360]   and security and being able to hold that information.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.960]   - But you can do the same thing with I-beacon.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.160]   You can say, no, I have to be within a centimeter.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.880]   I'm not gonna do it.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.920]   You can do that, right, Robert?
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.520]   - I-beacon knows how close you are.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.440]   - Yeah, but there's a latency.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.800]   So it takes a few seconds holding it there.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:06.640]   - Okay.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.080]   - NFC, you can just tap in.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.240]   - It's right away.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.080]   - And it's very-
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.360]   - We are woefully behind the times when you look at people.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.120]   I know our mutual friend Renee Richie talks about,
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.880]   I mean, just it's crazy to think in Canada,
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.120]   how far advanced they are for payments with NFC,
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.520]   up there, everything from train tickets to gas payments,
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.960]   to food purchases, all NFC enabled,
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.320]   but they come to the United States
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.840]   and we're woefully behind the times.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.400]   I think if some of the partners like with Google,
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.880]   I go to Home Depot quite a bit.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.160]   And at the checkout at Home Depot,
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.920]   I believe they have the Google wallet.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.480]   And PayPal.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.120]   But this is one of the rare occasions
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.320]   where I see like Google wallet payment,
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.400]   out in the wild.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.440]   So I think it'll be important to have,
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.320]   who appears on stage with Apple
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.680]   for an NFC announcement in a few weeks.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.240]   - One of the things people are using NFC for a lot now,
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.240]   it's not payments, but is tap to pair
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.480]   where the NFC does the Bluetooth pairing
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.440]   kind of automatically.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.200]   And I see devices in the store all over the place
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.720]   where you just tap your phone to it
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.480]   and it'll handle all the ugly details
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.680]   of a Bluetooth pairing.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.680]   You can't do it on an iPhone.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.400]   That might alone, that might be a reason,
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.400]   even iHome, which makes all those iPhone gadgets
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.140]   has NFC tap to pair.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.160]   That might be a reason too, not just payments,
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.560]   but you're right, the money is in payments.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.280]   So, so many of the chat rooms said,
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.200]   here we go again, the annual iPhone will have NFC fantasy.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.200]   - This year, this year, I would be really surprised
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.600]   if it doesn't this year.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.000]   But I'd be willing to--
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:49.840]   - Boy, you touched.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.160]   - You should drink on it.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   - Wow.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.880]   You pair-- - It's a stretch.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.800]   - You pair NFC, he'll drink on anything, folks, don't die.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.040]   You pair NFC with Touch ID,
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.240]   the fingerprint reader in the iPhone.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.320]   And now you have something very interesting
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.000]   because you have additional layer of security.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.680]   I'm gonna trust something with a Touch ID
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.320]   and NFC much more than I am a credit card with an NFC in it.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.200]   - Right, like coin.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.880]   I mean, I would love to be able,
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.280]   I mean, in partnering with a lot of the major credit card
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.760]   companies and payment structure that way,
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.200]   so I could just put my credit card information
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.280]   right inside my iPhone,
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.720]   type it in the way that you would keep on,
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.480]   with inside of, help me the name of it,
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.360]   inside the, oh, inside now, you can keep that with,
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.160]   what's the name of Apple's one password structure?
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.200]   - Keychain.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.320]   - Credit cards, keychain, right, exactly.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.920]   You can already keep your credit cards on file
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.520]   within Keychain, so enabling Keychain support through NFC
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.120]   and being able to pay with the credit card of choice
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.560]   upon checkout without having to carry your wallet,
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.480]   your MetroCard and all these other things would be fantastic.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.320]   - I totally buy into this and the idea that Apple
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.240]   can have this ecosystem, they've got the credit cards,
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.640]   they have the whole thing,
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.720]   but so many times we've seen Apple poised,
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.120]   really ready to do something like this
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.080]   and just unable to pull the trigger, for whatever reason.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.920]   Passbooks are a good example where they've had that
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.280]   for how many years and they've really done nothing with it.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.000]   It's got my target card in an airplane boarding pass.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.120]   - Yeah, I was really disappointed after a long,
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.240]   I was super excited about it, you know,
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.440]   think of Amtrak and mobile boarding passes
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.120]   and all of those things and after launch,
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.280]   it was impossible to even figure out how to get it
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.120]   from the app into Passbook to be able to use
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.520]   the little certificate, the little share sheet certificate.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.400]   - Who's faulted that? - You take with you.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:49.840]   Well, I mean, it seemed like, and it was using some weird,
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.840]   before iOS 8, it was using some weird URL scheme, right?
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.760]   - That was the only way you could do a handoff
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.320]   before extensions.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.400]   So now with extensions, I think you're gonna see a whole new,
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.520]   you know, a whole new life for Passbook using extensions.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.960]   But yeah, before it was some really janky URL handoff
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.400]   and most of the apps, you would wonder why Delta,
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.160]   or Delta could do it, but Southwest didn't know how to do it.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.360]   Or, you know, United have the real-
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.320]   - I have to blame Apple. - Which means
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.160]   there's Apple. - I couldn't do it.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.080]   - 'Cause it's Apple's job then to go to all those people
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.520]   and say, here's how you do it, we'll help you,
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.320]   we'll do it with you while a sign in engineer to you,
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.400]   we'll make sure it happens.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   Apple just seems to, whether they lack the resources,
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.680]   they lack the commitment, they don't have the leadership
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.560]   from the top, something's missing,
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.040]   that's keeping them from capitalizing on Ibekin, right, Robert?
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.960]   I mean, Ibekin's been around for two years now.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.880]   - No, no, no, Ibekin came out after my book ship,
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.320]   so it last September.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.960]   - Okay, well, it's not that long, then, a year.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.120]   - And it's really, it's really, it's really,
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.200]   and the whole the hands of developers like that,
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.560]   and really try to bring corporate partners on board,
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.040]   you know, I think that they've just expected everybody
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.640]   who's going to want to be on board,
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.520]   and who want to be a part of it.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.240]   And so I think that probably plays a part
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.600]   of the reason for lack of success,
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.400]   and I also wonder how much, you know,
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.680]   talking about NFC and why we had to wait so long for,
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.120]   how much they really expected Bluetooth LED to take off,
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.680]   and maybe they're making some movements behind the scenes
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.800]   to try to get that rolled out into point-and-sale terminals,
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.240]   and ultimately just got no traction whatsoever,
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.880]   and they're fine, you know, throwing in the bag
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.720]   and going with NFC now.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.440]   - I agree with that, and I heard,
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.400]   I heard rumblings of that a few years ago
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.720]   that Apple seemed to be all in with Bluetooth LED,
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.560]   and I don't know what that is.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.880]   - See, that's the risk, though, of doing NFC,
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.200]   you're flip-flopping.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.360]   And as you know, Clayton Moore's working at Fox and Friends,
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.800]   flip-flopping is bad.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.800]   - I'm wearing sneakers right now.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.280]   - Good not resist.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.440]   He's taking his suit off, folks.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.840]   - That's a different, it's a different person entirely.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.480]   - I just feel like Apple, for some reason,
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.920]   cannot pull the trigger on these.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.480]   They get these great technologies,
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.720]   they get these great ideas.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.920]   You sit there, you watch the WWDC speech at iOS 8,
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.320]   and you go, "Yeah, when they integrate that all together,
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.160]   "it's of a whole brave new world."
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.000]   And then...
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.720]   - Well, the proof will be in the pudding, right,
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.520]   when we saw the announcement of HomeKit
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.840]   and the health initiative from Apple, right?
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.680]   We have, we're all pontificating about how great this is
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.440]   gonna be for blood pressure being sent right to your doctor,
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.480]   and, you know, if you live in rural West Virginia,
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.720]   a place that I know well, and I was a reporter years ago,
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.240]   I mean, it was like 45 minutes to an hour
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.560]   to get to a heart center.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.400]   And that's a real concern for people
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   that live in those areas.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.800]   And certainly, I talk to, I let a panel on healthcare at CES,
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.240]   and we're talking about the inefficiency
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.520]   of getting information to, you know,
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.000]   certain parts of the world,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.840]   being able to have smartphones in those areas
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.520]   with heart rate monitors on the back
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.000]   to be able to put your thumbprint on there
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   to read that information.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.720]   So, can HomeKit carry the torch,
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.280]   exactly what you're saying, Leo,
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.400]   and HomeKit and also the health initiative.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.160]   Here it is, here's our HomeKit.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.640]   Now, are we gonna work with a few big partners
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.120]   to make sure are we gonna work with you,
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.640]   are we gonna work with,
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.960]   are we gonna work with Nest owned by Google
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.000]   (laughing)
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.600]   to make some of these big things happen,
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.680]   or are we just gonna wait and let it die on the vine again?
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.760]   - Isn't that part of the problem
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.720]   is that Apple wants to keep it all to itself,
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.680]   and it doesn't work that way?
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.840]   Although, as Jeff Nino points out,
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.560]   this is endemic in the tech industry.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.160]   Google has an issue,
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.680]   how many initiatives is Google announced
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   and then just forgotten about?
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.480]   - I think there's a lack of follow through in general.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.400]   All these companies are ADD,
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.080]   and they just go, what?
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.480]   Oh, squirrel.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.920]   And then they're off doing something else.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.120]   - It's hard, these technologies need time
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.560]   to get rolled out and get people to understand their value.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.720]   Most, I've given several speeches in the last couple months,
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.520]   some to computer science people,
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.760]   and they have no idea what beacons are.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.880]   And so, it's an education process.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.400]   It takes time.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.520]   This is why Doug Engelbart got kicked out
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.320]   of his own research lab in the 1970s.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.520]   - He's better than the mouse in the window.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.080]   - Yeah, 'cause his ideas were too ahead
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.480]   of even his friends at the research lab.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.040]   - Well, even though the companies like Delta United
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.920]   and those would roll out these apps,
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.600]   so you could have mobile boarding passes
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.560]   that weren't pass booked necessarily enabled,
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.240]   but even when they integrated with pass booked later,
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.560]   and you would go up to the attendance,
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.480]   I don't know if you would notice that
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.720]   when you go to the different gates,
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.480]   and they would look at you like you were an idiot.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.320]   - What do you mean, you have a boarding pass?
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.160]   No?
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.520]   - Right, you have a boarding pass on your phone.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.360]   What is that?
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.400]   You gotta go back to the counter-making.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.880]   - Now I do it on my watch,
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.760]   and they ignore me there.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.800]   - Yeah, I guess it looks when I do that too.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.640]   Especially when it doesn't,
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.720]   when it's the wrong boarding pass,
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.560]   when you're watching, you have no words.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.400]   - You have no words.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.240]   - You have no words.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.480]   - I get stuck at a TSA kiosk,
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.040]   because it wouldn't work.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.080]   And they said, "Well, and you have the email that came in,
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.800]   "I'm going like this on my phone.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.880]   "Everybody's going by me, I know."
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   Well, Nien, yeah.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.960]   It was like, "Oh, I finally got in though."
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.080]   I did.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.100]   It's not, it's flaky.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.280]   Speaking of, you mentioned coin,
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:09.480]   how many of you bought the $55 one card to rule them all?
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:12.080]   Robert, of course you love every new technology.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.200]   - Yeah, anything new is really great.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.240]   - Yeah, I love it.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.760]   Clayton, you didn't buy it, but you reported on it.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.440]   - Yeah, I didn't buy it yet, but I--
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440]   - Yeah, it's a very important word,
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.840]   and you want to keep that yet going.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.520]   Tim, did you fall for coin?
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.360]   - I have not invested yet.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.400]   No, I'm fascinated by the concept,
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.080]   but I'm still optimistic that credit cards in general
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.360]   are going to be retired in the not-to-distant future.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.640]   So I'm holding out on for them.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.240]   - So they took $55 from lots of people.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.120]   We don't know how many total, but lots of people.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.040]   And they charged them.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.240]   Coin is delayed now, at least until spring 2015.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.800]   So--
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.520]   - By the way, there's a couple companies.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.240]   Tappingo is one of them.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.160]   - I think it's Tappingo.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.360]   - The guy who invented it says it's Tappingo, so--
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.200]   - What?
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.520]   (laughs)
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.160]   - It's Tappingo?
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.960]   Tappingo is how he says it.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.320]   - Oh, Lord.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.600]   'Cause I called it Tappingo.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.200]   - It's Tappingo. - It's Tappingo.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.120]   You tap it and you go.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.160]   - He said no, it's Tappingo.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.080]   - It's Tappingo.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.920]   - Ralph LaRuella School.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.760]   - It's Tappingo.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.240]   - Is it Jeff or is it--
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.440]   - It's gift. - Jeff, everybody knows it's gift.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.720]   It doesn't matter what Tappingo says.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.520]   - I know, it's the same argument, right?
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.800]   - Tappingo. - We're on this argument
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.000]   for 20 years.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.880]   They, if you're a college kid at Santa Clara University,
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.280]   you use it to buy everything.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.760]   Your sandwich, your coffee in the morning, your books.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.320]   And there's a machine in the sandwich shop.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.080]   So when you say I want a sandwich,
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.480]   it sends the order to the machine.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.600]   It lights up, it beeps and it spits out a receipt.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.280]   The receipt goes into the workflow of the restaurant.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.560]   And you walk in and pick up your sandwich and you leave.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.560]   You don't hand them a credit card.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.760]   And already 70% of all the transactions
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:56.000]   at Santa Clara University are going through Tappingo.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.760]   - And is that an NFC technology?
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.560]   What is the technology?
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.160]   - No, it's, you don't even need that
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.440]   because you know you're there at the store, right?
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.000]   - It's geofencing.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.520]   - Geofencing, right?
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.360]   - And see, that's what's shared--
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.240]   - I thought was the problem with sandwich.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.000]   - I thought that was the problem with square wallet.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.440]   And was that the geofencing was so inaccurate
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.280]   that you couldn't have two stores next to each other use it.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.200]   - Yeah.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.040]   - Yeah.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.640]   This works and it's working at scale
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.160]   for Santa Clara University in 25 other campuses.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.880]   I think 75 campuses are getting it this fall.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.840]   So he's growing like a weed, like a virus.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.400]   And in six years, I bet we're all gonna be using it
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.240]   for everything.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.240]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.280]   - And he's gonna own a cut of every transaction
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.280]   on the internet.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.800]   So he could be a trillionaire if he is successful.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.920]   - You know what's amazing is that he came out of nowhere.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.760]   - Yeah.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.600]   - I mean, his career is going out of this business.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.480]   - His dad's a famous entrepreneur,
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.200]   his dad started Zorran, and his family has a lot of--
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.120]   - I think that's pronounced sharday.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.080]   I'm just joking.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.400]   That's boy, that's an old joke.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.080]   - I got it, Leo.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:09.920]   - Thank you.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.520]   - Anyways, he's a smart kid.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.360]   - Yeah.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.200]   - He's a smart guy.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.560]   - Tap and go, AKA Topingo.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.640]   - Topingo!
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.120]   - Topingo!
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.600]   - And you can't use it if you're not a college kid.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.800]   I remember some other company doing the same thing.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.360]   - Yeah.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.560]   So it's iPhone and Android, and then it's an app.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.400]   - Yeah.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.000]   - And so it just knows you're in line.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:32.840]   Never wait in line.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.400]   You place an order delivery orders appear at your door.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.840]   So is it just ordering remotely?
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.560]   - Well, it's remote ordering, you pick it up.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.760]   It's also a contextualizer, and that's why I got interested
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.000]   because after buying ice lattes at 9 a.m. every morning,
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.080]   it'll say, "Would you just like your normal ice
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.280]   "lottie today?"
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.440]   - Oh, wow.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.160]   - And it saves you on scrolling.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.880]   - If Google did that, there'd be protests.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.560]   - Oh, there'll be protests for this company as well.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.040]   It's just nobody knows about it yet.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.200]   - Yeah.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.960]   - That's 'cause they're pronouncing their name wrong.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.480]   - Tapingo.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.680]   - Tap, it looks like Tapingo.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:12.520]   To be fair.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.720]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.360]   - Scobles here, the scobolizer.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.120]   Will you do that?
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:20.960]   Will you come up here?
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.560]   Can I book you and have you come up for an hour?
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.680]   - I'm up in a little--
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.200]   - And we can trade.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.600]   You can teach me about other things.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.960]   - I don't know anything.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.800]   - I want to--
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.720]   - Actually, for people who don't know
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.880]   why you're Leo LaPort, I am Leo LaPort.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.120]   - Why are you famous and a big deal
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.160]   because you would help people on the radio
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.280]   and you would know the most bizarre fish
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.800]   about OS2 and Windows and the Macintosh.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.640]   - I still do.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.120]   - But it's not really much use anymore.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:47.960]   That's the sad thing.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:51.160]   - That's true, but that's why you're sitting on the ball.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.840]   - But when I get questions about OS2,
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.480]   I can really get in there and leap in there.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.280]   - You know, for the 15 people who are still holding out.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.600]   - Loop pay, is that something you used at Boston University?
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.880]   Or Northeastern, wherever the hell you went to school?
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.680]   Everywhere, loop pay.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.000]   That's the similar idea is to--
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.400]   It's a fob.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.760]   NFC, probably then.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:14.600]   No?
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.920]   It sends a magnetic pulse.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.680]   - The problem is the thing that Topingo actually solves
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.640]   is integrating into the restaurant
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   and having the restaurant pay attention to your order
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.680]   so that it's ready when you come in.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.960]   - Yeah, but it also solves Costanza Waliditis.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.320]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.120]   - I think that's really--
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.920]   - Where do I come up with these?
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.360]   It's my job to feed the startup.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.720]   - That's what he does for Rex, please.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.520]   - I go around the world and study the future.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.320]   I'm just seeing stuff before most other people.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.320]   - Robert Scobel never met a technology he didn't like.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.480]   - I wanna see it all.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.120]   - Tim Stevens is also here.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.000]   He is, among other things at SCN,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.960]   doing a lot of automotive stuff, which is cool.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.800]   - It is cool.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.960]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.520]   - Anything you knew and exciting you want to plug or promote or?
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.480]   - Well, we just had Pebble Beach last weekend,
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.160]   which I said we didn't get to go out to,
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.400]   but we did have our X-Car team was there
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.240]   and they did some amazing videos.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.760]   - That new Mercedes concept car, that's what I want.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.440]   - Yes, yeah, and there's the new Aston Martin concept car
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.440]   which there's, well, I think the DP100 is called.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.040]   So a lot of great video footage out of there,
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.800]   some great galleries as well.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.000]   And I'm on a ray, hopefully we'll be able to go next year,
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.640]   but then we're not too far away from the Paris Auto Show.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:32.400]   That's early October, which is always amazing,
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.800]   beautiful concept cars out of Paris.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.840]   So I'm looking forward to that as well.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:38.840]   - I don't remember the Carmel car show used to be
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.360]   the, what the Concord De Le Gons.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.320]   It used to be all about, you know,
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.600]   beautifully fixed up cars and Lamborghinis.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.240]   I know this new concept,
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.080]   this was always at the auto shows you
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.120]   to get the concept cars.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.680]   They're now, I guess, 'cause they didn't want to drive them around.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.840]   - But they still do the, the Concord is still there.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.640]   That's still the highlight of the week.
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.880]   But now it's become, you know,
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.920]   it's much more a commercial thing these days.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.240]   So a lot of manufacturers,
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.520]   they know that a lot of the car journalists
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520]   are going to be there.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.960]   So they've kind of used the account audience
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.760]   to start to launch concept cars
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:12.840]   and that kind of thing as well.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.440]   So that's part of the reason why that's happening.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.160]   But still, you know, the focus is by and large still
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.720]   on the Concord and the beautiful old cars.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.840]   I think it was a Ferrari, a post-war Ferrari,
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.960]   the first post-war Ferrari to win,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.480]   I think in a very long time.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.160]   - This to me, the numerous cities looks very much like
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.520]   the Naboo Starship.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.920]   (laughs)
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.520]   - Episode one, does it not?
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.600]   Am I wrong? - Does?
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.440]   Yeah. - You can drive it
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.160]   and grant you a 6.2 if you want to take it
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.840]   for a spin. - Can you?
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.120]   - Yeah, I was actually there at the launch of that car
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.200]   and it was kind of funny, there was a guy standing off
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.840]   on the side of the stage that they drove it out on
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.080]   with an RC car controller.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.160]   And that was how he controlled this concept car
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.520]   with a giant RC car controller.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.520]   There's actually nobody in the car.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.360]   It was him driving off the side of the stage.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.680]   - Is this chrome?
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.200]   - It is chrome, yeah, okay.
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.040]   So it's gonna look like a DeLorean in a few years.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:08.200]   You have to have a full-time shiner.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.560]   - I don't know if it's raw aluminum or not.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.000]   - And it doesn't look like it has wheels.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.320]   I mean, it has wheels, doesn't look like it has tires.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.160]   - Yeah, it's a car from the future for sure.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.920]   But that will never go into production,
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.920]   but there is a-- - Is the future
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.600]   they'll have no tires?
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.960]   - Absolutely, well, very skinny tires.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.360]   They're working on a-- - Is that the Chamfer
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.920]   11 competitor? - It's a Chamfer
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.280]   that's right there.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.960]   You're seeing it in person.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   - Thank you, Johnny Eyed.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.360]   - Johnny Eyed would love.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.960]   This is the best Mercedes we've ever made.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.880]   - Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.360]   who do go to meeting.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.760]   I've told you so many times how important go to meeting is.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.400]   It's fact the only way we meet at the Twit Brick House
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.920]   because nowadays, many of the people we meet with
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.320]   are not here, just like this show.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.960]   They're spread out all over the world.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]   That shouldn't stop you. Thanks to the internet.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.520]   We can meet practically face-to-face with people.
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.960]   You should go to meeting their HD video conferencing.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.640]   Crystal clear, everybody's got a camera now.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.160]   You see people just like you're in the same room with them.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.440]   And because you're using go to meeting,
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.600]   you also see their screens or they see your screens.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.240]   It's as if you're showing them your PowerPoint presentation
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.400]   or collaborating together on a document,
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.920]   eliminate the expensive and time consuming travel.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:21.160]   It makes those meetings more effective.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.960]   Everybody knows meetings are kind of the backbone of business,
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.520]   but you don't want to spend more time
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.520]   than you have to. Citrix go to meeting makes it easy.

[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.440]   it is a fabulous system.

[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.760]   It is definitely the way to meet in modern times.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.320]   It is in effect the Mercedes concept car of online meeting.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.920]   It's funny. This is this is just I just saw this and I said,
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.080]   I'm not even a car guy and I said, I want that.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.640]   Vic Condortre was there.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.240]   We now know what Vic is doing since he left Google and Google
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.600]   plus he's going to car shows.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.480]   Pretty much whatever he wants to, I think. Yeah, he's retired.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:33.000]   What else?
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.560]   It's been such a week week for news for tech news.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.760]   You know what I found interesting?
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.000]   Well, not that you care, but I care.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.080]   No, Clayton, please. I beg of you.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.360]   I care deeply. I was I was struck.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:48.680]   No, I find interesting Natalie's new profile picture on Facebook.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.600]   Oh, I just saw that. Yeah, just popped up.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.600]   You know, I took that of her in Portugal.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.800]   We were in Portugal for a week last last fall right around the
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.720]   time he's getting more and more beautiful.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.560]   If you don't mind me saying, she's like a fine wine.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.680]   She just gets better with a better and better or or a fine cheese.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.960]   Like an like an age.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.000]   OK, just a little tip.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.440]   Never compare your wife to a fine cheese.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.400]   She likes an aged good at two.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.600]   Anyway, what do you find interesting?
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.840]   I'm sorry. No, this Microsoft story.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.120]   And I, you know, I'd love scobles take on it too, which is that,
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:29.840]   you know, Microsoft really ought to release Windows 9 sooner rather than later because
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:36.440]   and I, you know, many large enterprise organizations have simply not updated to
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.720]   Windows 8. I don't know how to get any sooner.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.480]   I think September 30th, the beta comes out and it'll be
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.920]   spring which for the next version of Windows.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.440]   Well, and I thought the piece was an interesting article at this afternoon.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.640]   I forget who wrote it, but it struck me because really the point of the piece was
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.800]   around Windows 7 being the issue that you're going to have to pry Windows 7
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.120]   from my cold dead hand.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.880]   You know, Windows 2000 was like that.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.520]   Exactly.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.720]   For a long time, I just.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.560]   Yeah, I wouldn't upgrade.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.480]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.280]   And I mean, you look around at all the computers at, you know, a news
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:13.640]   court building and other, you know, I pop into different offices, you know, across
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:18.120]   the city, Windows 7 or earlier, none of them are upgrading to Windows 8.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:23.640]   So I, you know, it's, um, Robert, you worked at Scoble.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.160]   You were their kind of their blogger and Microsoft.
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.520]   I mean, what did I say?
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.440]   Scoble.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.520]   You worked at Scoble.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.440]   Scoble enterprises.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.960]   OK, I really am officially now too old to do this show.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.360]   I'm going to retire.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.920]   Robert, you worked at Microsoft.
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.800]   What would you do now?
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:46.880]   I mean, uh, this, you know, Windows 8 clearly was a time bomb.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.400]   Uh, Steven Sonofsky, the man who designed it gone.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:56.360]   Steven, uh, bomber, the guy who was running the company at the time gone, not only gone as CEO,
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.480]   but bomber is now out at the on the board.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.720]   He's going to go down and run a basketball team.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:08.800]   Uh, I don't know because, uh, uh, Windows is not where my interests are anymore.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:09.600]   Well, guess what?
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.520]   You're not alone.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.600]   And that's the problem.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.880]   You know, the world has moved to mobile phone and my
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:19.000]   Microsofts and cloud and a whole range of other things.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.560]   And soon it'll be wearable computing.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:28.960]   Um, as soon being this fall, maybe with an Apple Watch or over the next five years, you're
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:37.920]   going to see a lot of things that you're going to put on your body to study whether you're having a heart attack or having cancer or, or, uh, on and on, right?
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.360]   Um,
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:48.120]   uh, you know, their problem is, uh, they're being ripped apart from the low end by chrome, the Chromebook.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.680]   And that's why Microsoft now offers windows free to anything sub nine.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:58.200]   The school teachers are telling me they're going Chromebooks at, as they can buy one for $200.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.120]   That's really nice.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:03.320]   And it has no maintenance costs because there's nothing to it other than a web.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.400]   Well, and it's not just that.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.880]   Uh, you know, the documents, the documents are in the cloud.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:10.320]   If a student loses one, he hasn't lost anything.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:16.040]   Google now has this new classroom that is essentially going to replace moodle and
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.200]   blackboard in schools and it's free.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.560]   Uh, Google is being very strategic with education.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.720]   And I think smart.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.080]   So, so they're eating, they're eating the business from the low end.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:35.520]   Business has really enterprises roundly ignored windows eight because they don't want to go there.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.440]   Yeah, because it's a very different UI and a training cost.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:44.280]   Although let's be fair, this happens every other windows with true to, right?
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.480]   There's still people running XP on.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:46.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.800]   Twenty five percent of all windows users are still running XP.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.320]   Well, that's enterprise because they just don't want to retrain.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.680]   And Windows seven was fine.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.720]   Well, there's no real compelling reason to go to a new version of Windows.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:04.120]   If I was at Microsoft working for Satya, I would be focusing all my effort on mobile
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:09.240]   and just letting windows rot and, and, you know, you know, you got bad news, though,
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.800]   because Microsoft has lost mobile already.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.840]   I know that you know that, but that's where I would be focusing all of my effort,
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.800]   because if if they don't get involved with mobile, everything falls apart.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.720]   And does this new strategy work for Microsoft being able to piggyback on Android devices
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.800]   and I made a deal.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.880]   They made a deal with Apple to get rid of Google.
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:36.200]   So Bing is going to be the search engine, the default search engine, the iPhone this fall
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:44.520]   in iOS eight and, and in return for that, they give Apple office on iPad and iPhone.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.320]   And a lot of people are praising those two things.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.640]   A lot of people are pissed off, especially Windows mobile users who are not getting
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:52.400]   touched first.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:57.040]   Anybody who bought Windows mobile users does not listen to this show because every
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.560]   time I listen this show, it's there's no apps.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.360]   There's no support.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.640]   There's no venture capitalists who's investing in it.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.520]   There's no entrepreneur who's carrying it around.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.560]   When you go to a hackathon, you don't see them.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.840]   There's no love for it.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:08.960]   It's done.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:10.960]   So you have no idea.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.920]   Did you see Superman?
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.560]   Did you see Man of Steel?
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.120]   Every reporter Lois Lane uses those fun.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.920]   That's true.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.680]   OK, so they bought and they bought their way onto a movie, but nobody loves it.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680]   Right.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.320]   You know, nobody in the app loves it.
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.520]   I mean, those reporters had to be on the cutting edge, right?
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.280]   They're breaking news.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.040]   Lois Lane, Pulitzer Prize winning reporter and the phone that she's using is the one
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.080]   that gets the least amount of updates and is the slowest to respond.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.120]   Very, very briefly, I think, what was it?
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.400]   Was it Ray Donovan?
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.240]   For one season they were using Windows Phone and then they quickly, I guess the
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.640]   Microsoft money dropped a dried up.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.480]   You spoke at the Grow Conference up in Whistler this week.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.800]   And I'm not drunk.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.840]   I am sad about it.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.800]   Somebody just said his scowball drunk.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.600]   I'm sad about my friend who is in pain and napkin.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.840]   I just saw that.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:03.760]   I'm so sorry.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:04.560]   What's the matter?
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.480]   Do you want to go?
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.280]   No, no, I can't do anything because they're not allowed to get anybody that's not
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.960]   professional into the sellers, but there's a lot of people who are digging out
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.440]   and their their lines and in real time in front of me.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.560]   Oh, because of the earthquake bad news.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:25.520]   I know we have friends who own Silver Oak and I saw the free one of the first
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.080]   pictures I saw was just a trash.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.200]   Wine room.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.400]   Oh, terrible.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.600]   So where do I go with this?
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.920]   When I spoke to grow at Grow this week, we asked the audience who has an iPhone
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:41.960]   and who has an Android phone.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.480]   It was 80% iPhone or 70% some of us grow.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:50.000]   Grow is Debbie Lambda's conference for startup entrepreneurs.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.680]   So these are all startup people.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.480]   Startup people.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.000]   But when I did the same question at South by Southwest, same answer.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.120]   When I go to Web Summit, I asked the same question last year.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.000]   Same answer.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.600]   When I asked the same question at the web, same answer.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.440]   Well, I think what's clear is iPhones are being purchased by high-end upscale
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:15.240]   technophiles in great numbers, much greater numbers, androids being purchased by
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.800]   the rank and file by normal people, people who have less money because they're less
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.600]   expensive worldwide.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.760]   But there's no room for Windows Phone at all.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.960]   I never see a Windows phone.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:32.560]   I mean, I'm in a pretty somewhat populated area, a city, New York City,
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:37.840]   and I'm on trains subway, Times Square, walking through the city.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.000]   Oh, and that's another thing.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.280]   Techno elites, rich people, and everybody in Manhattan.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.880]   Right, right.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:44.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.400]   Let's get the Ritz, by the way.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.240]   Everybody in Manhattan has an iPhone.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.120]   Which is the Ritz.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.960]   I don't think that's why I don't think mobile is the answer for Microsoft.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.320]   I think the cloud is the answer.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.720]   Microsoft has always been successful in the cloud.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.920]   They have a strong cloud.
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:00.800]   But this deal with Apple gives me hope.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:07.240]   And if Satya continues to making deals with Apple, then Microsoft might align
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.040]   with the iPhone and start being building pieces of it and start building
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.120]   thing, you know, wearables and things that'll work with it.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:17.120]   I would love to see no kid with iOS on it.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.680]   That's never if you're a space alien and you come down to Earth and you.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.200]   No one told you ahead of time, who was the winner right now?
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:23.800]   Who was the leader?
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.360]   Who was the market share leader and you have?
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.520]   Android device is a space alien.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.920]   My goodness.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:32.040]   Robert is built into refrigerators.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.720]   If you were a space alien and you came down and someone said, OK, hey, can you name
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:40.560]   the most popular smartphone platform right now and you laid out Windows
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.920]   phone Android and iOS in front of them?
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.480]   I you might be inclined to pick up the Windows phone.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.280]   It's beautiful.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.360]   Pretty darn snazzy.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.920]   Yeah, especially this new HTC one with Windows phone.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:54.840]   I used to help run a consumer like Trangstore in the 80s.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.720]   And I learned one thing about how people buy things.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.960]   They don't want to appear stupid.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.800]   And if all of their friends who are are the people in this chat room.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.880]   Say, you know, there's no apps on this thing or look, I have both of them.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:13.120]   Like Marcus Brownlee carries both of them and all three of them, right?
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.800]   And he's not an example because he's a review.
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.960]   No, but people like that influence us.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.360]   And if you have a teacher who's really into tech or a friend who's really
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.240]   in attack, you ask him, what should I buy?
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.840]   And he's going to say, well, the iPhone has the best apps.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.840]   The Windows, the Android phones have the best choice and it's cheaper.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.480]   And the Windows phone has no support at all.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.440]   None of us use it.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.960]   So which one are you going to buy?
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.120]   You're going to buy the one that your friends have.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.760]   And that's the real problem.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.800]   It's a real problem for Microsoft.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:50.160]   And that's why if I was at Microsoft, that's the most interesting problem to work on.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.880]   And I'd like to work on interesting problems.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.640]   I don't like to just.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.520]   But what about the cloud?
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.840]   You know, what about the cloud?
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:57.640]   Look, it just has in here's my position on this.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.600]   Just as in the 90s, Microsoft by creating a solid platform for developers and a
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.960]   universe as close to a universal platform as you can get for PCs,
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:08.840]   establish the tech, the PC revolution.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.320]   There was no question that without Microsoft, there is no PC revolution
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.600]   because they built a platform everybody else could build on.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.280]   Well, it's clear the PC is not the platform.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.920]   It's clear there is fragmentation in the mobile space.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.440]   What is the platform for the 2010s?
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:27.160]   It's the cloud because the cloud is cross platform.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.200]   And that's where apps should be built.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:30.560]   That's where apps are being built.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.400]   And that's where the future is.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.480]   And Microsoft has a strong play there.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.960]   And Nadella knows that he came from the Azure Services Division.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.160]   The question knows how to monetize that.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.520]   That's a very different sort of thing.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.240]   If you're charging somebody, you know, $100 for each new version of Windows or 200
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:49.120]   or a lot more for each new version of office, you know, they can't charge for
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.280]   office anymore because of Google Drive and everything we've been speaking about.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:55.520]   The cloud is great, but they're basically giving away one drive at this point.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.080]   I don't know how many gigs of OneDrive's
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.720]   doors that I have that have been shoveled at me over the years.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.960]   And I have no interest in paying for it.
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.880]   And, you know, even if they do build out OneDrive to be the ultimate solution
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.160]   for consumers and they do build out a lot of great services around that,
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:13.920]   is there any possible way of monetizing the cloud that will bring them anywhere
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.960]   near where they used to be when everyone was buying Windows and everybody was buying
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:17.360]   office?
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.440]   And I don't think that's very interesting.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.440]   In fact, there is even the rumor and it's apparently credible, according to
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.920]   Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therat, that the next version of Windows will be free.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.160]   So that really does put them in a very difficult position.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.600]   If you can't sell the license, you can't sell software.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.360]   They still loaded up with a whole bunch of crap, right?
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:37.520]   Because most of, you know, most of the PCs you buy, you know, you don't get a pure
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.720]   Windows 8 experience.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:44.240]   You get loaded up with eBay and other random apps that come still built on right
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.080]   there when you launched it.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.560]   Microsoft doesn't get that money.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.680]   What do the OEMs do?
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.600]   Dell does.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.200]   Well, true.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:56.160]   So I think you're, I think your point is well taken, Tim, how do you monetize?
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:01.360]   How do you keep a company that's based on these incredibly high margin products
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.520]   like Windows and Office?
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.600]   Uh, how do you get that transition?
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.280]   That company is something that's so much more low margin or no margin.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.400]   That's actually a very good point.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:15.320]   And yet the cloud from the point of view of the enterprise, uh, is, is, is
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.000]   exactly what you need to be doing.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:22.160]   And I think there is an opportunity to sell licenses to cloud services, SaaS.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.840]   Software as a service.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.840]   Isn't that the future?
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:25.920]   Absolutely.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.440]   And you can make a lot of money on the back.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.320]   And I mean, ultimately there are going to need to be a lot of servers running this
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:33.080]   stuff and they'll need to be a lot of integration, especially in corporations
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:33.720]   and that kind of thing.
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.960]   There's certainly a lot of money to be made on that side.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:40.480]   But, you know, if, if your soul revenue stream is coming from enterprises, really,
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.200]   and, you know, if you're having to chase after advertising or something, sort of
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.240]   minor incremental revenue stream from consumers, you know, that's nowhere near.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.400]   If you can get the, you know, the windows and T set of things on the business side
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.760]   and have all of your enterprise customers and also have all the consumer
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.000]   customers that they had, you know, 10, 15 years ago.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.960]   And maybe you just have to see how they can sustain it.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.000]   Maybe you just have to accept that.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.520]   Maybe that maybe that's what I often feel like these companies are fighting
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.200]   against a normal business cycle.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:10.760]   A technology that business cycle is highly sped up, but, uh, that, you know,
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:14.360]   you got 10 years and then, you know, somebody else's turn.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.640]   Well, that's what everybody is.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.120]   Off-hold your snack.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:21.560]   You know what?
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.960]   I sense low blood sugar.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.760]   Robert's worried about his wine cellar friends.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:31.920]   Uh, Tim is just enjoying the countryside and Lake Tinky Wink is calling to Mr.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.760]   Clayton Morris.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.360]   I think you should have some maple habanero pretzel pops.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.080]   That's what I think.
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.880]   Maple habanero.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.240]   Do you want to wrap your mind around that?
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.200]   It's got the sweetness of maple.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.160]   And your own pretzel maple, not maple.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.760]   Mabel's not in this maples in it.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:52.400]   And then it's got the tang, the high capacens capacen of habanero.
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:52.800]   Capsation.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.360]   Cap-set.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:53.880]   What is it?
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.040]   Cap-sation.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:55.520]   Cap-sation.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.320]   I know this from my Latina wife.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:57.840]   Yes.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:58.960]   Uh, capsation.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.440]   Cap-sation.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:32:59.960]   Cap-sation.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.800]   That's the, uh, that's what gives it all the spice.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:06.080]   You know that the, the, uh, the spiciness of a, of a chili pepper is rated by the
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:06.880]   scoble number.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.760]   Isn't it?
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.400]   And then it's a pretzel.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.200]   So wait a minute.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:17.920]   No, so we have sweet maple spicy habanero, the fabulous salty taste and the crunch of
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.520]   a pretzel.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.160]   I don't know what the pop does, but it's what, it's what my mind's doing right now.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.520]   This is a nature box snack and get ready.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.840]   Is nutrition is to proved no HFC's.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.080]   No, that's high fructose coins here.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:35.640]   For those of you not in the know, no trans fats, no artificial flavors, no
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.560]   artificial colors.
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.640]   This is good stuff.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:38.720]   See nutrition is to.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.200]   This is nature box.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.320]   I have the capsation expert here.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.320]   Oh, look at that.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.520]   A beautiful Natalie Morris.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.880]   Like a fine cheese.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:52.080]   You're, you're just, we're talking about you're getting a habanero.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.040]   What is capsation?
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:58.920]   I use them like the powdered like substance that keeps, uh, peppers hot, hot.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:03.720]   And then isn't there, isn't the number, the rating of the, of how hot it is?
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.840]   The scoble scale.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.960]   The scoble units.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:07.360]   Yes.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.400]   See, I'm not making that up.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:09.240]   Right.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.800]   Yeah, scoble units.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.960]   Maybe, maybe, maybe it's a Scoville, right?
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:17.520]   Yeah, it's a bit of V, but I'm going to cause scoble units.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.040]   That's what I said.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:21.720]   There's spicy related stuff I needed to call my, bringing the habanero lady.
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.920]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.200]   Spicy, Natalie Morris.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.040]   Good to see you, Natalie.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.840]   And my superpowers that I can.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.600]   And which, which of your of your many children was that?
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.440]   That was nice.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.040]   He's spicy.
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.760]   He ate a spicy taco tonight that was so spicy here to have like two less
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.040]   milk because it was so high.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:39.880]   So that's good.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.640]   Miles is,
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.440]   we're trading him here.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.120]   Miles is a frat, a frat brother in the making.
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.080]   I can tell you right now.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:48.240]   Is he wearing a toga that about my son?
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.040]   Oh, believe me.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.600]   It's there's nothing you can do about.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.480]   That was really upsetting.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.680]   Oh, no, no, I'm so sorry.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.440]   No, he'll never join a frat.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.080]   I promise.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.560]   You can't delight yoga with my son upstairs.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.880]   No, like de Bro him.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.520]   Yeah, he's not a bro.
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.440]   Namaste.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.720]   I recognize the God in your.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.400]   So do you.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.880]   Oh, all right.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.480]   All right, D bro.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.200]   I'm hey, hey, bro.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.080]   Go go do your downward dog.

[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.080]   Warrior pose.

[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.800]   Water, true to concept.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:22.560]   Yeah, because if you are drinking diet Coke all day long, I got to say the guy who
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:27.360]   figured out you could take water out of a tap and put it in a bottle and charge
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.520]   like a buck for it must be very happy right now.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:36.680]   Yeah, my head of Philadelphia, when I lived in Philly or grew up there, they had a
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:42.240]   the local city water commission did like a campaign where they took the tap water
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.760]   and they just put like Philly tap water on bottles.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.920]   I was telling it, but as a joke, but also to prove a point, like Philly tap water,
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:54.440]   I think New York City tap water is like some of the finest, finest water in the world.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.160]   So they were making the point like, if you live in these cities, you don't need
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.440]   to be buying bottled water.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.800]   Yeah, because you have good tap water.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.600]   Right.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.800]   Actually, Manhattan has the best tap water in the world.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.240]   They say, right.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.920]   Very famous because it's getting it from the
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:11.360]   the Skykill Reservoir or something.
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:14.200]   It's it's supposed to be very, very, I think consumer reports
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:17.720]   rated it the best water that you throw out the Evian.
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.440]   That stuff's from France.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:23.160]   That can't be good and have your good old fashioned American tap water right there.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.520]   Skycles are beautiful place to it.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.000]   It's just from here as a matter of fact.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.320]   And they actually had snipers in the trees after 9/11 to protect the water
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.600]   and to protect the bald eagles, which I also like to hang around there.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:35.720]   You know, I don't think terrorists would go after bald eagles.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.680]   Not the eagles, but probably the water.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:42.680]   Well, one of Leo, one of the interview questions I had when I was
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:48.040]   trying to get into Microsoft was, how do you sell ice to Eskimos?
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:55.480]   And that was a question to study how good are you at coming up with marketing ideas.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.720]   Wow.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.520]   Could you sell best cities for clean drinking water?
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.360]   Number one, Des Moines, Iowa.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.760]   All right, I don't buy that.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.560]   What is this? Forbes? What do they know?
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.880]   A bunch of capitalists.
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.200]   Austin, Texas is number two.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.560]   Well, Chad, you lived in Austin.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:12.760]   Is the water good in Austin?
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:13.840]   Yeah, I actually like it.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.520]   So who falls south Dakota?
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.120]   All right. All right.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.320]   All right. All right. All right. All right.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.560]   Miami, Miami, Florida, Florida water is terrible, isn't it?
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.960]   Yeah. It tastes like sulfur.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:28.520]   Well, in fact, because most of Florida is below sea level and global warming,
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:34.520]   man made or not, I don't know where you stand on that one, but because of global warming,
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:41.160]   it is believed that, for instance, Miami Beach is going to just go away in the next
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.080]   Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.560]   Miami is like because of global warming is like going to be gone in like five years.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.320]   The this already there.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:52.320]   There's a billion, multi-billion dollar project in Miami Beach to stave back,
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.320]   to hold back the waters because it's encroaching on the underground sewage system.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.600]   That's why the water is so good.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:05.320]   Miami is my just be clean water instead of actually tasting good,
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:08.160]   which would make a lot of sense because they would have to purify.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.080]   Here's a story I thought was very interesting.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.520]   It's not breaking news, but I thought it was very interesting.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.200]   A study published in Science Express.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.680]   They describe four experiments based on their results.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:24.720]   People are recalling information less because of Google.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.200]   Why bother to remember when you could just Google it?
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.040]   In fact, what people are doing instead of trying to remember something is remembering
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:32.760]   how to find it.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.880]   That makes sense.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.240]   Here's the here's the tell you test to see if you're one of these people.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:46.040]   Imagine somebody asks you and I'll ask you right now, everybody in the audience,
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.280]   how many countries have flags with only one color?
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.840]   Some of you, you old timers will start thinking of flags.
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.280]   Most of you will start thinking of where you would search to find that.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.360]   Yes.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:40:59.720]   Wow.
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.040]   How do I Google that?
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:01.600]   Right?
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.280]   Welcome to the 21st century.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:10.640]   This concept, by the way, is not new to the computer age.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.760]   It's called transactive memory.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:15.840]   That's the sum of information held by a group.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.480]   Think of it as a group of experts working as a team where each person has their own
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.840]   area of expertise.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:24.440]   But now, of course, we don't need the team.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:25.120]   What are you looking at?
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:25.600]   What is that?
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.360]   Oh, he's looking at and you go.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.560]   I did a search for red flags.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:30.160]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.240]   And then you can do one for green flags and blue flags.
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:33.760]   You go.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.680]   Is it evolutionary though?
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:36.320]   I'm curious.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:41.720]   You know, we there are certain things that we needed to remember more of 200
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.440]   and, you know, 300 years ago.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.440]   Are these things now less important to us that we don't need to worry about them
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.840]   because the tools have come along.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.680]   So that part of our brain has shut down.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.200]   I don't remember.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:51.960]   Not shut down.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.560]   It's just replaced with more personal stuff that you can't Google.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:03.360]   OK, so more important things or maybe other nuggets of information that I, you know, I can't
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.560]   remember the last time I paid attention to a phone number.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:06.680]   I only.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.320]   I think I remember as my wife's owner and my childhood phone number growing up in my
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:10.680]   parents.
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.080]   I remember my home phone number as a kid.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:17.200]   I vividly remember that, but I haven't had to memorize a number since because my phone
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:17.560]   does it.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:22.080]   And in fact, when you exchange numbers these days, what's the easiest way to do it?
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:22.880]   You have somebody will.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.280]   I don't know my numbers.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.120]   Let me just call you.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.200]   Right.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.120]   And now it's in your phone.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.520]   Right.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.400]   Right.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.120]   That's the easiest way.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:32.360]   Just call me or text me your number or something like that.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.840]   Is it that better because we're remembering names, not numbers.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:35.880]   We don't need to remember numbers.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.840]   It's way better when I was I was a software developer for a long time.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:42.640]   And when I first started to learn software development in the 90s, it was a lot
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.160]   of memorization of APIs and calls and things like that.
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:49.320]   But as the tools got better and as the research abilities got better, you know, you didn't
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.600]   have to learn APIs anymore because the tools are going to look up everything for you.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.080]   At that point, it just began kind of a game of remembering what each module could do,
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.160]   what each language could do roughly and knowing where to look to find it, basically.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.600]   But you didn't have to remember anything anymore.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:06.400]   And suddenly you could go out and learn a new programming language in a couple of days
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.080]   because you only needed to get the syntax down.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.000]   You didn't have to memorize every little bit.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.320]   And ultimately that made me a much more powerful programmer.
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:17.520]   And I think that's kind of the general approach that we're being able to take to our day to day lives.
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.680]   Now with the smartphones and being able to look up things dynamically and get directions to places,
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.200]   you don't have to remember even how to get anywhere anymore, which is I think it's a good thing.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.040]   I do too.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:31.920]   But I'm worried about the vapidness though with the, you know, because just the level of
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:37.080]   information we have access to now and we know, I mean, and Tim, I'm sure you can speak to this
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:40.720]   as a writer and the reaction that you would get from longer posts on Engadget.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:45.160]   We see this with BuzzFeed and the small, you know, smaller and smaller snippets of information.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.720]   And, you know, people are only looking at screens for a few seconds before they move on to the next thing.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:54.680]   They're not really sitting there reading 40 minutes, 40 minute articles or, you know,
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:58.480]   in digesting 10,000 words and like we used to.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.160]   And so I know there was a period.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:05.680]   I felt like there was like a two year period that where I just don't think I remember to damn thing.
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.360]   Where I used to sit inside of Barnes and Noble for hours and just read like foreign policy magazine
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.360]   and time magazine and just go through these large articles and I'd have then when I would go on the air,
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.840]   I would be able to have like a contextual analysis.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.440]   And I would be able to be able to pull from this as a history major and be able to say,
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.840]   well, you know, back in 1960, this happened now.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:29.680]   There was like a two year period a few years ago where I felt dumb as a rock.
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.640]   I just felt like I wasn't remembering anything and I couldn't contextualize large pieces of information.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:38.360]   I couldn't contextualize news stories in a way that I used to be able to.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:43.200]   And I really blame that on just like consuming small snippets of information and not sitting for long periods.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.040]   Factoids.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.200]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:51.400]   So, but as broadcasters, we can't, you know, you can't sit here and Google an answer as you're when you're sitting there on the set.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.200]   Right. So it's actually we may be the last holdouts.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.600]   People actually have to know anything.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:00.040]   Or at least remember anything.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:03.960]   Speaking of numbers, Leo, have you seen this app called human yet?
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:04.440]   No.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:07.360]   Oh, my wife was telling me about this.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:08.400]   Yeah, I haven't played with it yet.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.480]   She got annoyed by it though.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.520]   She got annoyed by it because there's so many notifications.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:13.120]   It what is it?
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:13.440]   What is it?
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:17.080]   It's like a contacts manager for everything, right?
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:19.640]   It's not it's a fitness context.
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.320]   It's a fitness track.
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:25.680]   No, it's a replacement for your eye for your phone and your contacts.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.600]   Oh, so here is how you know them.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:33.480]   So people that you met at a given meeting or you can run queries in there to say,
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000]   who is this?
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.040]   Why do I know them?
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:37.040]   What did I meet at this meeting?
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.440]   And I recuse myself and say that I actually done some advising with humans.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.840]   So I clear.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:45.160]   No, well, that doesn't don't recuse yourself.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:48.520]   We now understand that you, you know, have some relationship with them.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:49.400]   But tell us more.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.440]   I think this is interesting.
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.000]   So the idea is basically to bring some of the this intelligence in, you know,
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.920]   in a modern system to your contact book.
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:00.600]   And so instead of just saying, you know, so and so is last name begins with a,
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.200]   so therefore he's at the top.
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.360]   I say instead, this is the person that I call a lot.
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:08.120]   So therefore they're going to be at the top or I'm traveling to San Francisco.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.000]   Who do I know who lives in San Francisco and then post a message and say, Hey,
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.920]   I'm in San Francisco or I need to get an introduction to somebody at Google,
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.360]   because I'm looking to get a job there.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:19.320]   Who do I know who works at Google or who do I know who knows somebody who works at
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:23.080]   Google and basically trying to bring that sort of smart and that sort of real
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:26.800]   world context and relationships to, to an app effectively.
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:31.640]   It also keeps your contact list up to date because let's say I have an old business
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.200]   card from Tim Stevens that I scanned five years ago and it's in my Google
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:42.320]   context and he got a new job and a new phone and all and a new email address.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.720]   And I don't know any of that.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:49.280]   He can validate his account and say, Oh, replay.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.200]   If anybody has these things in their context, replace them with the new thing
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:54.320]   and send it out.
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.720]   And then everybody's contact list gets up to date.
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.600]   How do you really nice?
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:59.080]   How do you?
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:46:59.800]   So it's plaque.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:02.000]   So it's similar to plaque.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.720]   So, but it's for mobile phone.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.920]   It's much nicer than then plaque.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.080]   So it's contextual.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:12.080]   So if we're together, it starts telling us information about each other, which is
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:12.520]   nice.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:18.720]   And it also, if I, if I add you, let's say I meet you at a party or something.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:23.560]   And I ask, Hey, can I enter your your email address into my contact list?
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:26.360]   It'll even keep track of what party we met at.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.760]   So, you know, four years later, when I.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.040]   But you have to enter that in.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:33.120]   No, it knows where we are.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:36.200]   Yes, it's mobile first.
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.760]   So it's location because of that.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.040]   It can actually say, if you've got a meeting coming up, it'll say you've got a meeting
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.600]   with Betty who you met at this party and see Betty's picture.
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.960]   So when you walk into that meeting, you'll now know what Betty looks like because I'm
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.680]   terrible with names, which may tie back to this other issue that we're talking about
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:51.960]   not being able to remember anything anymore.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:55.040]   But the Apple base could prompt you about the people that you're about to see
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:58.040]   and where you met them and kind of give you some contextual clues to help you.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.480]   Remember who those people were?
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:00.640]   Which is great.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:03.680]   It's iPhone only for us.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:06.440]   Android version coming very within days.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:07.480]   Oh, good.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.640]   I don't know about that.
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.160]   It's hard to find because I just interviewed the CEO last week.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.560]   You said within days.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:14.360]   All right.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.560]   Let's say a couple of weeks.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.640]   OK, that could be 14 days within days.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.040]   Hard to find because human is kind of a generic term.
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:23.040]   It's you.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.200]   And yeah, I am.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:27.400]   Oh, no wonder I couldn't find it.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:28.960]   Like cap station.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.840]   I am like cap capisasin.
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:34.080]   All right, let's take a break and see.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.720]   We got a great panel here.
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:37.720]   We got a few more stories.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:39.480]   We're going to wrap it up.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.600]   Mr. Tim Stevens here from Cnet.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:45.520]   Mr. Good to have you.
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.360]   Thank you Morris from Tinky Wink.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:50.400]   The night has descended on the lake.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.920]   This is really straight out of the cabin in the woods.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.920]   I swear to God.
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:57.400]   I'm just waiting for a trap door to open down the hall.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:01.280]   And Robert Scobel from space.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:05.880]   And we had a great week on Twitter.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.640]   Do we have also a week ahead?
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:11.160]   No, OK, so we don't know what next week's going to look like.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.720]   But if I look back last week was a killer watch.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.920]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.360]   Something's wrong with this picture.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.640]   Look, I finally found a good use for an iPad.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:24.200]   This weekend enterprise tech.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.320]   So I'm here at the blackout.
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:27.640]   In 2014, we're talking to Fluke Networks
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.880]   and what they're doing to shut down drones
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:31.640]   and Google Glass in your enterprise.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.280]   Marketing Mavericks.
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:36.240]   Facebook now feels like they actually have to tell us
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.960]   when something is that type.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.560]   Not to tell us, Tony.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.640]   It's to tell only the morons.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.240]   Security now.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.080]   We now know what ISP pushed the wrong button
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:51.960]   that caused a major problem throughout the entire internet.
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.520]   All about Android.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:57.040]   Ignore no more is developed by a frustrated mom
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:00.120]   who created this app that gives her the power to remotely lock
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.440]   and disable her kid's phone.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:03.960]   I hope to never have to use a app like this.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.800]   I don't want to ever want to use an app like this.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.760]   To it.
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:08.440]   Some assembly required.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:09.920]   Miami just appeared.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:11.440]   I was going to do the rest of the show this way.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.600]   It's not the travel size.
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.320]   Emmy, because it doesn't look like it's in the.
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:15.200]   Oh, I see.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.680]   He just swung that out.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:18.560]   He's coming.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:19.880]   It was like, like, brave.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.000]   And the week ahead actually is going to be pretty big.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:25.840]   I think we're going to.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:27.400]   Well, next week we won't.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.160]   Next week's the last week of August.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:32.320]   The following week, we're going to do live coverage.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.160]   I assume Motorola is going to do this of the of the Moto X
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.120]   or whatever announcement September 4th
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:40.840]   and then Apple September 9th.
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:44.360]   What is Motorola going to announce on September 4th?
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.280]   We talked a lot about Apple.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.640]   What about Motorola?
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.360]   Watch 360.
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.600]   The 360.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.600]   Mm hmm.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.840]   A new Moto X.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:56.680]   I see.
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:58.960]   I thought the Moto X was like the best Android fun of the year.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:00.240]   You're all iPhone users.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:01.600]   I can't talk to you.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:02.120]   I have a note.
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:02.680]   I have a note.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.200]   I have a note.
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.000]   I like the Moto X.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.320]   That was one of my favorite Android phones.
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:05.960]   I love it.
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:06.400]   It's in Texas.
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.320]   And I feel like by the way,
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.200]   Motorola is still on by Google, right?
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:11.760]   It hasn't yet become Lenovo.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:16.760]   So this is the last kind of Google Motorola phone.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.760]   Anyway, I'm excited.
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.760]   You don't have to be.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:19.760]   It's OK.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.760]   It's just me.
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:21.760]   I understand.
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:22.760]   What are you most excited about the watch?
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:23.760]   Why want the watch?
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.760]   Phone combo.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:27.760]   See, I like the Moto X because it was a pretty pure Google
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.760]   experience and yet it had those nice.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:30.760]   You could talk to it.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:31.760]   It would talk back to you.
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.760]   It would know when you're awake, know when you're asleep.
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:34.760]   It was like a little buddy.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:35.760]   It was cool.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:36.760]   I did like that feature.
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:37.760]   Just the camera was so terrible.
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:40.760]   But the camera was crappy and it was only 720p 4.7 inches.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.760]   And I suspect that the camera was so terrible.
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:45.760]   It was crappy and it was only 720p 4.7 inches.
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:47.760]   And I suspect that what we're going to see is they're going to
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:53.760]   fix the hardware with a good camera and maybe a five inch
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:55.760]   screen that's 1080p.
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:57.760]   But is it going to be ahead of the curve?
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:58.760]   I think that's the question.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:01.760]   I think Moto X was a good phone, but it just felt like it was
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.760]   maybe six months too late.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:03.760]   Maybe it's too late.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.760]   It was a phone that I think a lot of people loved because
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.760]   of the personalization too, which is certainly nice and I hope
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:09.760]   that they maintain that.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:12.760]   They are going to maintain a supposedly they're going to
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:15.760]   maintain that the leaks show wooden backs and things like that.
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:16.760]   Good to hear.
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:19.760]   And then there are a lot of people who are upset and I'm going to
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.760]   ruin your life because I was excited.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.760]   Apparently LG is also going to do a round Android Wear watch.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:27.760]   And of all the watches so far, until Apple does it, it's
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.760]   watch.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.760]   I think the Android Wear is the one.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.760]   But they're ugly and clunky and square.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:35.760]   Motorola's got this round 360, but I'm going to ruin this for you
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:36.760]   now.
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.760]   And somebody told me this and it's really pissing me off.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:40.760]   There's this black bar at the bottom.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.760]   And now having seen it, you can't unsee it and it's in all
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.760]   the pictures.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.760]   Damn it.
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.760]   It's so weird.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.760]   Gosh darn it.
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.760]   It's hard.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:52.760]   It's hard.
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:55.760]   There's some stuff in there.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:58.760]   It's hard to get a screen that's circular.
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.760]   Around the entire industry has been making square screens.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.760]   LG has announced they will also do a round screen.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:09.760]   John Gruber calls it a flat tire.
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:12.760]   Damn you Gruber.
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:15.760]   Just a rush to get these things out.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:16.760]   Yeah.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.760]   We saw that.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:20.760]   They had the Aura smartphone which had a round display.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.760]   And I was just looking at pictures of that and there wasn't
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:23.760]   anything.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.760]   There's nothing like that on the Aura.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:27.760]   And I always figured that the displays were very similar
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.760]   between the Aura and the one of 360.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:32.760]   But there's no little flat tire on the Aura anyway.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:37.760]   I love this.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:40.760]   Google has admitted that it's self-driving cars are programmed
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:43.760]   to exceed the speed limits by 10 miles an hour.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:45.760]   Which is how we all drive.
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:47.760]   Might as well.
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:50.760]   What person other than my wife drives 10 miles under this
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:51.760]   speed limit?
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:53.760]   If you were in a self-driving car and we're going the speed
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:55.760]   limit, you'd go hurry up.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:57.760]   Come on.
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:00.760]   Or she'd yell at me and slow down and be like Google's driving.
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:03.760]   For the record Volvo self-driving cars can also bring the
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.760]   speed limit by about the same.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.760]   They say.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.760]   That's fine.
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.760]   I don't have a problem with that.
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:12.760]   CHP California Highway Patrol Mine.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.760]   Which isn't there.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.760]   I had talked to a highway patrolman a few years ago on a story.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.760]   And I thought the plus or minus was like the error rate.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:22.760]   Maybe it's much improved now.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:25.760]   But to hold up in a quarter of law was like seven miles per hour
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:26.760]   plus or minus.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:27.760]   I think it's also.
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:31.760]   So let's not underestimate the embarrassment factor of
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:33.760]   hauling somebody into court for going four miles over the
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:34.760]   speed limit.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.760]   You know you're trying to hit quota if you're doing that.
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.760]   I think it's really more of that.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.760]   I saw bridesmaids.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:44.760]   They look at the guy.
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:45.760]   He's going to work.
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:46.760]   It's okay.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:47.760]   And then what?
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:48.760]   That guy's going really way too fast.
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:51.760]   It's, you know, it's a judgment call.
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:55.760]   Does anybody work for the highway patrol here?
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.760]   I'm just curious.
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:02.760]   I saw I was sitting on a Golden Gate transit bus going to work.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:03.760]   They were training a driver.
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:06.760]   And I figured these guys know because they drive every day.
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:08.760]   He said you can go six miles over the speed limit.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:09.760]   You'll never get a ticket.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:10.760]   I don't even.
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:16.760]   I haven't had tickets since 1997 I think.
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:17.760]   Something like that.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.760]   And your policy is seven miles over the speed limit.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:20.760]   Seven miles an hour over him.
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.760]   Do you set the cruise controller?
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:23.760]   You just kind of have a.
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:30.760]   In Virginia, twenty over is a misdemeanor and I won't tell you how I know this.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.760]   Burke, you say 10.
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:35.760]   How do you know 10?
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:40.760]   Burke says 10 miles over the speed limit with this certain tube that makes me feel like
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:41.760]   you know a CHP officer.
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:46.760]   And always like slower than five mountain hours in a faster cars.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:47.760]   If you're.
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:51.760]   If there's cars going five miles an hour faster than you, you're never going to get dinged
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:56.760]   because unless the trooper can't keep up with those faster cars, then he'll just get you.
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:59.760]   You're the you're the fish in the back of the pack that the shark eats.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:01.760]   You don't want to be that person.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:04.760]   Seventy two is how fast he goes.
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:07.760]   You can get a ticket for going too slow in the left lane.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:08.760]   That's right.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:11.760]   My daughter got a ticket.
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:13.760]   I shouldn't tell anybody this, but I'm going to.
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:18.760]   My daughter got a ticket because she didn't go when the light turned green because she was
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:19.760]   texting.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:23.760]   So she got a ticket for texting and for obstructing traffic.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:24.760]   Ouch.
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:25.760]   Ouch.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.760]   That hurts.
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:28.760]   That's going to be a question.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:32.760]   Will the Google self driving car have a camera looking backwards to look for flashing blue
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.760]   and then once you fold over.
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:39.760]   And if so, will it hand the license and registration over automatically or will you have to do
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:40.760]   that yourself?
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:47.760]   It actually does look behind you and it does look for lights that are flashing in a certain
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:48.760]   pattern.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:49.760]   Does it?
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:52.760]   Will it pull over?
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:54.760]   That depends on the programming.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:57:00.760]   Shouldn't the police just have like a tractor beam or something for these cars and just
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:03.760]   can they flip a switch and the car goes oh give up.
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.760]   You got me.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.760]   It should just like it should be up.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:12.760]   They'll just follow you like they followed OJ Simpson until you stop and then they'll
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:13.760]   go hey.
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:17.760]   Somebody who sounds like they know in the chat room says there's a four to five mile an hour
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.760]   leeway due to differences in speedometer calibration.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:24.760]   However, six to ten is entirely up to the officer and dependent upon road conditions,
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:25.760]   etc.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.760]   That sounds right.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:28.760]   That sounds right.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:32.760]   Our show today speaking of all of this brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.760]   Needle lawyer?
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:37.760]   No, they're not a law firm actually.
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.760]   They give you self help services at your specific direction.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:43.760]   You wouldn't go to them to get out of a speeding ticket.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:45.760]   However, do you have a will?
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.760]   This is a National Make a Wheel Month the month of August.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:55.760]   I'll tell you, if you've got property, if you've got kids you don't want the courts to
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:57.760]   say what happens.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:59.760]   Don't procrastinate.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:02.760]   People think maybe I can't afford to do a will to expensive.
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:03.760]   It's going to take too much time.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:06.760]   It takes about 20 minutes at LegalZoom.com.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:07.760]   Cost very little.
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.760]   What is the cost for a will?
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:11.760]   I think it starts at $69.
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:14.760]   We're going to get you 10 bucks off of that if you use our offer code to the police.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:19.760]   We're going to get you a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:20.760]   Yeah, I mean this is great.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.760]   They also have things like the living wills, medical directives.
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:31.760]   They have a health care power of attorney, but they also have a pet protection agreement.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:34.760]   You know, all of this stuff, you ought to do this.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:37.760]   It's 39 bucks to make sure that Fido goes to a good home.
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.760]   Right, Aussie?
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:39.760]   Here comes my dog.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:42.760]   He says, have you done your pet protection agreement?
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:59:12.760]   It's a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good,

[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:14.760]   LegalZoom.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.760]   And here's the legal disclaimer.
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:21.760]   LegalZoom was developed by top attorneys to provide self-help services at your specific
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.760]   direction, but they're not a law firm.
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:26.760]   Legal help is furnished through vetted independent attorneys.
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:28.760]   We thank LegalZoom so much for their support.
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.760]   And don't forget to use that offer code.
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:31.760]   Quit me safe, 10 bucks.
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.760]   Do you have a will, Clayton?
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:33.760]   Of course you do.
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:34.760]   Oh yeah.
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:35.760]   Wow.
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:38.760]   I just turned the lights out of Tinky Wink.
[01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:39.760]   It was...
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:41.760]   Yeah, it just got dark real fast here.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:42.760]   Really fast.
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:47.760]   Yeah, with all the bears around here, I'd better have a will.
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:48.760]   [laughter]
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:49.760]   But I provide.
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:50.760]   Hey, boo-boo.
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:51.760]   I see your broadcaster.
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:52.760]   It was a giant Yeti.
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:53.760]   It's a Tinky-Nink broadcaster.
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:56.760]   Yeah, we hit it.
[01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:04.760]   Let's see.
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:07.760]   YouTube subscription service music.
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:10.760]   Somebody might know more about this than I...
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:11.760]   I don't understand.
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:19.760]   I do understand that most kids these days, there's no music on MTV.
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:23.760]   They're watching Big Brother if they're watching MTV, but if they want to watch music or listen
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:24.760]   to music, I see my son do this.
[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:26.760]   They'll queue up YouTube videos.
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:27.760]   And that's how you get music.
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:30.760]   If you're under 25, that's where music comes from is YouTube.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:34.760]   Right, but the big problem is you can't take that offline, of course.
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:38.760]   Yeah, and that's part of the solution that's going to be offered by this music-y service,
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:39.760]   supposedly at least.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.360]   I said you'll be able to queue up those things and take them offline with you, including
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.760]   supposedly concert footage and things like that too.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:47.760]   Ooh.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:52.160]   And there's been a lot of discussions and leaks about YouTube's offline video service for
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:55.760]   a long time now, and I've been pretty eager to see if YouTube could offer that.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:59.160]   So I'm curious to see if that'll get rolled into this as well, or if it'll just be YouTube
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.360]   offline for music-based stuff.
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:04.000]   But I think it'd be great if you could, you know, if you've got a flight coming up, you
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.120]   could go to make a big playlist of, you know, subscriptions on YouTube and funny videos
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:10.120]   and download them all and take it on the plane with you.
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.320]   I think that'd be great.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:15.640]   And $10 a month, if you could do pay that and have, you know, ad-free videos forever
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.240]   on YouTube, that'd be pretty great too.
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:23.720]   But right now, at least the leak is just pointing to music service, offline-able YouTube video
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:27.480]   stuff, and it will also tie into the Play Music service too.
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.840]   So you'll get both for $10 a month.
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.920]   André, please have this exclusive earlier this week.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:35.080]   I do like one of the features is no ads.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:36.480]   So that's the big drawback.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:39.760]   If you're watching, if you're like, made a playlist of YouTube videos of songs you like,
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:43.120]   you got to have a, you know, there's going to be an ad in between them.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.560]   So you can, if you pay $10, it will eliminate the ads offline.
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:51.920]   I think that's less desirable just because those are big files, right?
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.240]   And then background audio.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:58.640]   So it will continue to play on your Android device after you exit out of it, which I
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:00.640]   don't think YouTube does right now, right?
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:01.640]   No.
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:05.000]   Well, if you have one of the Galaxy devices, you can do the picture and picture stuff and
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.520]   some other Android devices have customizations like that.
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:12.880]   But I'm curious if this is built into the Android YouTube app or if they'll have a new
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:16.080]   app, because right now, you know, you can search for artists and that kind of thing,
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.560]   but you can't browse down through an artist's discography like you can through Spotify,
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:21.760]   for example.
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:24.840]   So I would think that it needs to do some pretty significant enhancements to the YouTube
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:26.560]   app to make it work.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:30.080]   Like this, which kind of feels like, you know, it's showing a square peg in around holes.
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.160]   So I'm curious to see how they handle that, how they make the YouTube app better for music
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:38.880]   playback than it is now, or if they really rely on the play music services, then it kind
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:41.800]   of just ties out to the video when needed.
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:43.320]   This looks like it's the YouTube app.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:45.800]   It's got the YouTube app logo on that.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.680]   This is the Android police screenshots.
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:51.800]   Audio only mode, turn off your screen or listen in the background while using other apps,
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:54.480]   add free music and offline playback.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:59.280]   You know, if it comes with Google Play music, that makes Google Play music all the more enticing.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:00.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.040]   That's what I use for my music because I love it because you've got 20 million albums.
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:06.200]   It's got all of my albums.
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:11.280]   So I can list it, you know, it'll store all my stuff from my computer.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.520]   What do you, okay, I'm curious.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:14.360]   So Robert, what do you use for music?
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:15.920]   What do you do for Spotify?
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.760]   Spotify, because you like social stuff.
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:25.560]   No, well, no, it has every music my people can come up with.
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:27.320]   Don't they all have the same?
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:29.160]   Roughly the same?
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.160]   Yeah.
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:31.720]   I know that that was only an iTunes.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:34.520]   There are a few bands that you can't, but mostly.
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:35.520]   Yeah.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:39.920]   I just, I got into Spotify and I love it.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:41.480]   It's a lot of my favorite.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:42.640]   I love, I love, I tried the beats.
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:47.560]   I tried the Google one and it's just, I like the UI better and I like the quickness of
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:48.560]   it.
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:49.560]   The search is really awesome.
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:52.800]   I love Spotify and I love the ability to make a playlist, share the playlist and know
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:55.520]   that every song on that playlist, everybody will have.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.520]   Yeah.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:58.080]   What do you use, Tim?
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:03:59.400]   I use Spotify as well.
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:03.600]   I still use play music for my offline collection.
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:05.880]   My old CDs that I've ripped and that kind of thing.
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.800]   I almost left Spotify for beats just because it was getting difficult to manage playlists,
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:14.120]   especially if you wanted to take an entire artist's discography offline.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:16.960]   I didn't think they were doing that very well, but they just recently changed with
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:17.960]   my music system.
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:21.600]   We cannot save an artist and then tag albums that you want and mark those for offline
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.760]   playback, which is much, much easier than it used to be.
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:25.760]   So since they made that change, I'm pretty happy with that.
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.960]   I also like the inclusion of desktop apps and the ability to play right from the web,
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:33.200]   too, which means I can play from pretty much anywhere.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.280]   How about Clayton, what do you use?
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:36.480]   I'm still sort of old school.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:39.640]   I love the idea of owning my own albums.
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:44.360]   I had a huge wall of CDs growing up and I used to sit there for hours in my room and
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:47.040]   listen to Pink Floyd and R&M and all these other albums.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.960]   I would digest that stuff.
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:53.040]   The idea of curating my own stuff has been great, but as I've gotten older, I'll launch
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:57.360]   iTunes and just play my own albums and playlists that I've created.
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:02.080]   But as I've gotten older, I realize my playlist is like 20 songs deep now.
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:04.920]   And really, I just want someone else to do the thinking for me that when I'm going to
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:09.320]   listen to music, I don't want to have to think about the extra layers of building playlists.
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.240]   So I love Songza.
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:12.880]   I'm a huge fan of Songza.
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:13.880]   Google just bought up.
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:14.880]   You just bought up.
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:15.880]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:16.880]   Yeah.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:19.040]   So you're able to pick the mood that you're in.
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:23.240]   So if you're having, you know, we're out on the patio cooking on the barbecue or something
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:28.880]   like that or having to cook out just afternoon, hit those songs and it'll, you know, I love
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.640]   like the Ron Burgundy bachelor pad playlist that the songs that has curated.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:34.640]   They have one.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.640]   Oh, I want that.
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:36.640]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:37.640]   There's so many great.
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:38.640]   And you know what?
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:41.680]   They actually work with certain artists like David Byrne and others to sort of curate their
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:42.680]   own list as well.
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:43.680]   That was the promise of beats too.
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:47.160]   Remember Jimmy Iovine saying, you know, human, human curation, there's nothing that can
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:48.160]   replace it.
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:49.760]   Beats has some really interesting features.
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:54.200]   You create a sentence that describes what you're in the mood for.
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:55.200]   Yeah.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.640]   So after you guys were talking about that, I think on Mac break last week, I hadn't played
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:59.080]   with beats and I downloaded it.
[02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:00.640]   I really love that idea.
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:03.600]   Like, I'm sitting by the, you know, so you type a sentence, right?
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:07.600]   Like sitting by the beach, having coffee, right?
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:12.080]   And it'll create a playlist given that idea and I love that idea.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:14.040]   Here's, here's a sentence.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.480]   This is from the iTunes screenshot.
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:21.080]   I'm at a party and feel like barbecuing with my best friend forever, a BFF to dance pop.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:24.120]   And then there's a play button and you'll get that.
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:25.720]   And I think that's really intriguing.
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:29.160]   And that's the same thing as songs that kind of, right?
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:31.760]   This is not, I don't think beats has received a lot of traction.
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:35.920]   Maybe they're doing better now than before the Apple acquisition, but what's the last
[02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:40.040]   album you all bought?
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.920]   I could tell you because I just bought albums last night.
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:48.480]   Not a physical CD or, you know what I've been buying lately is a high resolution tracks,
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:53.400]   high def tracks because my Pono player will be here in two months.
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:55.400]   What are you laughing at?
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:57.960]   Neil Young's good.
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:05.160]   So, so I'm starting to be interested in digital master tracks, you know, 192 kilobits, 24
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:07.560]   bits samples, that kind of thing.
[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:10.520]   Kilohertz, 24 bits samples.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:13.680]   So the last, I just bought about eight Joni Mitchell album.
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:14.680]   Okay.
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:15.680]   I got to go.
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:19.800]   I think the last one I bought was that new, that new Michael Jackson album.
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:20.800]   Thriller?
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:23.680]   The, I love the unreleased, the unreleased one.
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:24.680]   Oh, okay.
[02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:27.560]   Just came out that's, was tearing up the charts a few months ago.
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:31.560]   So a lot of the Michael Jackson stuff is, HD tracks, there's a number of places Pono's
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:34.880]   going to have its own music store, but I've been buying HD tracks.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:42.800]   And a lot, apparently these music companies are releasing uncompressed FLAC versions,
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:52.320]   recorded at 96 kilohertz, 24 bits or 128 kilobits or whatever, 992 kilobits, 24 kilohertz, 24
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:53.320]   bits.
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:56.800]   I probably can't hear the difference because I'm an old man, but I like knowing the bits
[02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:58.880]   are there, even if I can't hear them.
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:07:59.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:00.880]   Right.
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:01.880]   I do.
[02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:02.880]   It's like photo, photo, photo, ruses.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:03.880]   Yeah.
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:06.320]   It's like photo resolution.
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:09.320]   Somehow you feel like there's going to be something there.
[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:12.600]   And I bought, I bought Crosby Stills and Nash because I'm listening to Graham Nash's new
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:14.360]   book.
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:17.320]   And I bought, what kind of blue, Miles Davis?
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:20.040]   Oh, one of the great jazz albums of all time.
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:23.440]   Well, there's a 96 24 version of it from the master tapes.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:24.440]   See?
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:25.440]   Yeah.
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:26.440]   Now you're speaking my language.
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:27.800]   But you can't play it back in iTunes.
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:32.640]   You have to, there's an app for the Mac called Vox that you can play it back in, or you get
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:36.000]   your Pono player, put it on there.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.520]   Then listen to it on $10 earbuds and your gold.
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:43.480]   We've wasted enough of your time.
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.760]   Clayton is now actually in the Milky Way, which is pretty cool.
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:47.760]   Right.
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:48.760]   Yeah.
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:50.400]   You can see the Andromeda galaxy up there.
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.400]   Wow.
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:52.400]   Look at that.
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:56.320]   You look like Carl Sagan.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:59.720]   Except he didn't have such a big mic.
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:03.360]   Clayton, go to Read Quick App if you want to know more about Clayton's app for iOS.
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:05.600]   It's for the iPad and the iPhone.
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.080]   It'll help you read faster and enjoy your reading more.
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:10.080]   Thank you, Graham.
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.280]   And of course, you can catch them on Fox and Friends.
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:13.280]   What else?
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:14.280]   What else?
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:15.280]   You still doing the podcasts?
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:17.640]   Yeah, we still got our nerd podcast, the Grizzly Bear Egg Cafe.
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:18.640]   I've been doing it now.
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:22.280]   It's hard to believe we're entering our seventh year of doing that podcast.
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:26.600]   And, you know, we just talk, we just ran through.
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:31.080]   We both watched the new CW show, The Flash, The Pilot of The Flash.
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:33.400]   So we dissected that.
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:37.400]   We talked about Guardians of the Galaxy.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:41.800]   And we're talking about Gotham and some of the other nerd-related shows coming out.
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:45.440]   So Grizzly Bear Egg Cafe is just a labor of love that me and my best friend Mike have
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:47.520]   been doing for nearly seven years now.
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:48.520]   Wow.
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:49.520]   So that's great.
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:53.600]   grizzlybearcafe.com for that.
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:54.760]   Tim Stevens, what do you want to plug?
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.760]   Come on.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:56.760]   What do you think?
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:01.920]   Well, I just did my, I just finally got challenged the ALS ice bucket thing, which I threw a
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:04.640]   tomahawk at a, which is kind of cool.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:05.640]   So check that out.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:06.640]   Wait a minute.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:07.640]   Wait a minute.
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:08.640]   You threw a tomahawk instead of an ice bucket?
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:09.640]   Yeah.
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.320]   No, I made this big contraption of that ice bucket over my head and held by a string that
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:14.920]   I cut with a tomahawk and it's kind of hard to explain.
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:17.360]   But check it out anyway.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.920]   But from a more professional standpoint, I've got, you know, I'm working on a series
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:24.960]   of videos on the Google Lunar X Prize this summer, which is really exciting.
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:27.640]   Challenge in a series of teams are working to get to the moon.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:29.640]   They're basically racing.
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:30.640]   Competition ends next year.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.080]   This summer, a lot of those teams are testing their systems.
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:37.480]   So they're firing rockets and making sure that the rovers, rove and things like that.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.800]   So I've been visiting a lot of the teams this summer.
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.880]   Really good series on CNET should be a new entry later this week.
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:49.680]   I went to Brendan German to see a, basically a lunar camera system being tested in a simulated
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:50.680]   lunar environment.
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:52.840]   So, so look for that later this week.
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:53.840]   You have a good job.
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:54.840]   Tim Stevens.
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:59.560]   Here he is with the ice bucket challenge, the tomahawk at the ready.
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:00.560]   All right.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.920]   Thanks to Ashley Esqueda and also to Mark Hearn, I've been challenged to the ALS ice bucket
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:05.920]   challenge.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:08.680]   You know, I got to say one thing.
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:11.040]   Don't get on that ladder.
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:12.440]   That thing is going to collapse.
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:14.080]   I do stand underneath the ladder though.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:15.080]   That is it.
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:16.080]   I see these ladders.
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:18.760]   They advertise on my county fairs.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:19.760]   Just doesn't look safe.
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:20.760]   Okay.
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:21.760]   I'm just, I'm just saying.
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:22.760]   All right.
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:23.760]   Let's see it.
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:24.760]   You're going to throw it down a lot.
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:29.400]   It makes a lot of string to hopefully, if I cut the string with my axe, I dump a bucket
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:30.400]   of water on my head.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.760]   Oh, you just want to get in the blooper rail for best fails.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:35.920]   Oh, this is like, yeah.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:38.760]   Oh, look at this.
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:40.120]   Nada.
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:42.120]   Whoa.
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:43.120]   Whoa.
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:44.120]   Whoa.
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:49.520]   It was a slow burn.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:50.520]   It took a while.
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:51.600]   It's too much friction on the rope.
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:52.600]   I think it was.
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:53.600]   But it worked.
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:54.600]   All right.
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:56.240]   Nice job.
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:57.240]   That's great.
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.240]   Thank you, Tim.
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:00.840]   Thank you for very ed aims of you.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.800]   I like it.
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:04.080]   Thank you also, Robert Scoble.
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:05.080]   I'm serious.
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:06.880]   Come up here.
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:08.440]   Set my Facebook up.
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.560]   I will come up there soon.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:12.240]   We'll talk offline.
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:14.400]   Do it while I'm here, if you would.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:20.480]   In my ice bucket challenge, co-founder of Activision threw ice on my head and they
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:23.720]   made it colder than the ice that Tim used.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.960]   Wait a minute.
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:26.440]   How do they make it colder?
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.440]   They put salt in it.
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:30.640]   And they put it in the blast for all the stress run.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:37.800]   Yeah, my best friend Andy was one of the 12 guys who built the iPhone.
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:38.960]   Also was involved in their own little.
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:42.040]   Never allow a scientist to set up your ice bucket challenge.
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:44.440]   I think they're colluding with the people in the chat room.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:45.920]   We don't want to hear more about me.
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.000]   No, we love you, Robert.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000]   We do.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.360]   And look, they're putting salt in there.
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.640]   How many degrees colder does that make that?
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:53.400]   I don't know, but it was salty.
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:54.400]   Salty.
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:55.640]   Did it feel colder?
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:56.640]   It was colder.
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:57.640]   It was cold.
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:00.480]   Plus, I had three buckets of ice thrown on my head.
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:01.480]   Wow.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:04.920]   Are they going to surprise you?
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:06.440]   No, no, no.
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:07.440]   We planned it out.
[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:10.520]   I was wearing my Google Glass 2 and the Google Glass.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.560]   I don't know that it survived.
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:13.560]   Oh, my God.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:14.560]   You killed your glass.
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:15.560]   I killed my god.
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:16.760]   You're $1,500.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:17.760]   Google--
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.760]   Let's be honest.
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:19.760]   It's funny how to do it.
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:20.760]   Somebody had to do it.
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:21.760]   Somebody had to do it.
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:23.600]   Dopey Google accessory.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.600]   Dead.
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:29.600]   I figured since you all saw my shower picture wearing glass that you had to see-- that
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:31.080]   this was the revenge for that.
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.240]   And where are you doing this?
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:34.560]   This looks like somewhere maybe on to--
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:38.360]   This is right behind the ritz at Mullins restaurant.
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:39.360]   And yeah.
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:40.840]   It was fun.
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:42.320]   Yeah.
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:44.160]   The nerds in Half Moon Bay, man.
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:46.160]   Watch out for them.
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:48.280]   OK, stop talking.
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:49.280]   Just take the ice.
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:50.280]   Will you please?
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:51.280]   Oh, my God.
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:52.760]   It's going on and on and on.
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:54.920]   Who did you challenge?
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:55.920]   Errington.
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:58.840]   Who else did I challenge?
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:00.320]   I challenged a few people.
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:01.320]   Yeah.
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:02.320]   All right.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:03.320]   Here we is.
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:04.320]   Don't-- don't-- don't-- don't-- the sucker.
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.080]   Scott Jordan, who makes my clothes.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:08.080]   I relish every second.
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:10.080]   You're going to take down my back, are you?
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.080]   You're going to die.
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:12.080]   It is cold.
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:13.080]   I'll vouch for that.
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:16.080]   It is-- it is really colder than you think.
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:17.080]   [SCREAM]
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.080]   OK.
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:19.080]   Ladies and gentlemen--
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:20.080]   I have cold.
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:21.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:22.080]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:23.080]   Thank you in the studio audience.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.080]   Wonderful to have you.
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:25.080]   The VM World Conference is coming up.
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:29.040]   We have a few engineers here for that and people from all around the world, including
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.680]   two who just met at their high school reunion.
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:32.680]   And that's kind of sweet.
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:35.360]   What a date.
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:37.360]   Make sure you go to teespring.com/twit.
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:38.360]   Last chance.
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:41.920]   Two more days to buy the Brick House third anniversary T-shirt.
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:44.080]   This shirt will never again be made.
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:46.040]   $20 benefits to it.
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:47.840]   And we appreciate the support.
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:49.560]   How many have we sold so far?
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:50.560]   $870.
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:51.560]   That's great.
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:52.760]   We don't get all of the $20.
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:55.400]   Some of it goes to Chinese slaves.
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:56.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:00.120]   Twit-- no, I think these are all made in America, as a matter of fact.
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:01.120]   American slaves.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:02.120]   American slaves.

[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:10.240]   You can watch Twit 3 PM Pacific, 6 PM Eastern Time, 2200 UTC every Sunday afternoon.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:11.240]   That's when we do it live.
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:14.360]   We love having you live, but of course, if you can't make it on demand audio and video,

[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:20.640]   And wherever you get your podcasts or somebody said, you should mention all the podcast apps.
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:21.640]   I can't.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:23.800]   There's many of them.
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:29.560]   We do like Stitcher, but iTunes, of course, the Xbox Music Store, the podcast app, Insta
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.720]   Cast Downcast, there's so many of them.
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:34.560]   And we have quite a few third party Twit apps, even.
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:36.800]   In fact, that's a good way to get it.
[02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:39.400]   And of course, if you want to be in studio, email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:40.640]   We'll put out a chair for you.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:41.640]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:42.640]   We'll see you next time.
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:43.640]   Another Twit.
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:44.640]   Yeah.
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:45.640]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:46.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
