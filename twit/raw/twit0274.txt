[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.960]   We're going to cover the latest tech news all around the world.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.480]   Joining me now in studio, I'm very happy to see the man
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.680]   with a hair, Mr. Brian Brushwood.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.200]   That's me because Owen doesn't have hair.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.600]   Yeah, so it'd have to be you, wouldn't it?
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.200]   Deduction, sir.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560]   Brian is back from his triumphant engagement in Orlando
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.680]   at the Halloween Horror Night.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.080]   Halloween Horror Night.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.880]   Universal Orlando puts on the number one tourist destination.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.560]   If you're in a Halloween and getting scared,
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.880]   they have 800 houses, three stage shows,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.080]   a bunch of scare zones.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.600]   It was six weeks of four to five nights a week,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.040]   four to six shows per night.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.880]   What?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.600]   And they got these giant, you know, a thousand plus seed
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.160]   auditorium they pack at every single show.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.960]   It's just this nonstop.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.600]   Brian's packing at every single show two times a night.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   That's amazing.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   That's amazing.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.240]   Now four to six, four to four on regular night, six on peak nights.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   That's crazy.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.640]   This is the well dressed O and JJ Stone.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.560]   Oh, doctor from odoctor.com and ask,
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.040]   go doctor the fine podcast.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.640]   He's today be imbibing the fine Guyana Royal Extra Mature
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.400]   Demorera Rum.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.120]   Once you open it, you have to finish it.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.840]   That's what I'm been told.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.440]   So it's going to be one of those shows.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.640]   It's going to be one of those shows.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.560]   It's definitely one of those shows.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.440]   Also with us from boing boing.net, the great Jenny Jardin.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.960]   It's so good to see you, Jenny.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   Hi Leo.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   For joining us.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   She's not drinking.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   Oh my God.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.960]   Oh my God.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.800]   Yeah, I got my nails done, especially.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.480]   She's got some bizarre fruit.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.960]   What is that?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.440]   I think it's called the hand of Buddha, Mano de Buddha,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.080]   but maybe some of the the Twitter audience can tell me exactly what it is.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.680]   I like to call it, "Kthulu fruit."
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680]   Yes.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.880]   She's got the nose.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.120]   Have you tasted it?
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.120]   It looks citrusy.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.200]   Is it citrusy?
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.760]   If I can put on a wine snob adjective flow for a moment here, it's like a really fine,
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.040]   fresh lemon with hints of jasmine and undertones of fruitcake.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.200]   And undertones of death.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   I want it.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   I love Cthulhu.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   I want it.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.600]   Well, Cthulhu entices you into your death.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   That's right.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   Yes.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.800]   The claw of Cthulhu.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   On my keyboard it lies dreaming.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.680]   Okay, leave it there because it scares the hell out of me.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.160]   Also here, speaking of scaring the hell out of me, John C. de Vorak.com.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.000]   In reference to the jersey you're wearing, I should mention today, scored Miami 29 Tennessee
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   17.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Good work.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.280]   I am wearing a Tennessee Titans jersey.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   Thanks to Oh Doctor.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   Who is?
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   Twit colors.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   Who is this?
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   Chris Johnson.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   Chris Johnson.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   How is Johnson doing?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   John, is he?
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   I think he's quit the team.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   So embarrassed.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   So embarrassed.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   It's a throwback.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.480]   It's an instant classic on Gileo.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   Just one up in value.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.440]   Thank you for letting me answer that question.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.440]   Let me wear this.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   John, calm down.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.440]   This is very nice.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.520]   So tomorrow 10 a.m. and we're going to cover it live.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.760]   Facebook has yet another, I can't believe Facebook.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.000]   It seems like almost every week now they're having a town hall and announcing something
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.280]   no one knows for sure.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.080]   But the rumors are, and I think pretty good rumors, Facebook's going to do a Gmail killer,
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.120]   a Facebook email.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.640]   You've got the domain FB.com, which they apparently snookered out of the farm bureau.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   Really?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.400]   I was hoping they would call it mail.com.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   Mail.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   Mail.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.040]   Would have been a good email.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   Mail.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.040]   No, they got FB.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   I'll send you a email.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   Mail.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   It's a new kind of email.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   It's F mail.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.480]   So I know you left Facebook and then had to come crawling back.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   And I have.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.880]   And now you can see why because Facebook is where it's happening.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.800]   So I was going to say, are you happy now that you're back?
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.760]   Do you think it's doing stuff right or was it a symbolic gesture over privacy or are
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.720]   you really digging it now that you're back into it?
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.520]   No, I don't dig Facebook.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.400]   You know, it's, it's, there's this element of social compulsion.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.840]   It feels like to me that if you participate, then your friends are there.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.760]   And I've only added friends this time, not strangers.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.880]   And you just feel like you have to kind of.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880]   It's a tool to use.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.880]   I don't feel like it's a.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.760]   See, and I wonder if I feel like I'm pressured.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.880]   I'm like, I wonder if I'm insulated because I never made it about like my real friends.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.360]   It was like the answer is yes to everyone.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   It's another broad.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   Showbiz.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.480]   And that's how I use it at first.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.240]   And this time I decided to use it.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.720]   The only reason I came back is because I wanted to.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.280]   It was when places came out and I said, Oh, well, now I have to try that.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.840]   And I'm glad I did because they have been adding a lot of things.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.760]   And you cannot cover tech without covering these days without covering Facebook.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   You have to.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.640]   It's part of your job.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.000]   So, you know, it's, and it's, I never worry about privacy personally.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Oh, this is baloney.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.040]   I mean, give me the one reason that you have to cover Facebook.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.920]   If you covered tech, Oh, Intel came out with a new chip.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.200]   Let's see what Facebook shows how out of date you are.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.120]   We don't care about Intel's new chips.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120]   That's not where the news is.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.480]   The news is in mobile.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.720]   The news is in search.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.200]   The news is in social.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.080]   That's the news in tech these days.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.520]   And I remember, you know, for year, the last year, people have bitched at us for talking
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.360]   about Twitter so much, including you, John.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.520]   But that's where you were talking about Twitter too much.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   That was the.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.240]   That was the story.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.560]   And I think Facebook's a big story.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.520]   So if Facebook does Gmail, do they do a wide open mail system or do they do an extension
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   of Facebook messaging?
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.960]   I'll tell you why they might want to do the latter because there's no spam.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   Now, okay.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.320]   So far the proposal as I'm hearing it from you is that this is an email system that only
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.320]   happens.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.120]   You can, it's a closed email system like nobody from the outside can.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   We don't know.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.960]   We'll find out tomorrow, but they have a choice.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.400]   They could make it an open email system.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.400]   Right.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   Which is a smart thing to do.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.520]   Well, I mean, that's, I mean, how would you have an email system that would be closed?
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.000]   Well, then you already do, which is called Facebook messaging.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Right.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Right.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.440]   Although I guess anybody can message you that because I get messages from strangers.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.760]   They come because when they want to add you, they can send a message for the ad to get
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.760]   to you.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.880]   But they can't just kind of message you a lot only for an ad request.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.760]   I think that's how that works.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.320]   I think a two tiered system.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.680]   One is these are validated people on Facebook.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.520]   We know because Facebook says we know who you are.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.840]   These are valid real people.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.520]   And then these are not Facebook people.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.040]   They're in a separate inbox.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   It has to be open.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.480]   I mean, I mean, who number one, people don't switch emails.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480]   They don't know that much.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.720]   And to switch from Gmail, like with my docs and all the other things that come with Google
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   Suite.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   It's going to be hard.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   I mean, really, like you're going to give me an email whoop-de-do.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.680]   I mean, they're going to get young kids to start up on it and get numbers.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.840]   But people don't just switch email like that, especially just for what?
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.840]   Email?
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   Really?
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.840]   Jenny, what are you hearing?
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.320]   Do you think Facebook's going to do an email system tomorrow?
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.520]   I think I'm hearing the noise from all the same places that you are.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.280]   But the one thing I have to ask is why on earth would anybody trust Facebook?
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   Yes.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   Thank you.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   With email.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.040]   Do you trust Google?
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.240]   No, I don't use Gmail.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.640]   Well, I'll correct that.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.880]   I do use Gmail for bulk accounts only.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.800]   And occasionally, if somebody needs to send something like a Google document.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.960]   But I don't trust Gmail with anything that I wouldn't want published or sent to the feds.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.320]   Who do you trust with your--
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   Exactly.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.320]   Who do you use?
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   Do you--
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   Ashmale, who do you use?
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.520]   If I told you, I'd have to--
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.080]   I don't use-- okay, because you're not going to use your internet service provider.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.680]   Because that's going to be even worse than Google.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   You don't--
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.600]   So I-- no, I do use my internet service provider.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.400]   But you have a high security one?
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.640]   I have an ISP that I trust more than I trust Facebook or more than I trust a free service.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   I pay my ISP.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   Good answer.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.640]   Free.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   But don't you--
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.640]   The domains are hosted in Canada.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   Oh, well, that's why you're saying--
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.320]   Well, a lot of what we do at Boing Boing.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.160]   So there's different things that you can do to improve your email security.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.720]   And using free web-based services, you know, I don't even know enough about Hushmail to
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.200]   really feel fully trustful there.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   Right.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.080]   Hushmail incorporates PGP encryption, but you're right.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.600]   We don't know what happens at either end.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.920]   I used Hushmail for a while before it felt like a hassle to go through.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.920]   Right.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   You know, and it get lazy.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.120]   And I hate that I'm one of the cattle that's just like, oh, I don't know.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.720]   I really should be more private, but this is just so easy.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   Thank you, Gmail.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.920]   Jenny, do you use a Canadian host because Corey's from Toronto?
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.320]   I think that's actually how it started.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:45.680]   But over the years, it's served us very well when we've been on the receiving end of slap
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:52.680]   lawsuits, different kinds of lawsuits, or legal threats intended to limit what we publish
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.160]   and limit critical speech.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.920]   So it's served us well, but it actually didn't start out as a way to certainly evade any
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   law.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   I'll say also, as far as web security, I'm a big fan of what the people behind the tour
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   project do.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.360]   I use tour every day, no matter whether I'm in this questionably democratic regime or
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   another one.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.320]   I travel to Guatemala, Africa, Asia a lot.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.840]   And I like to take extra precautions wherever I go.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.000]   You're really paranoid.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.560]   Well, you know, I think five or 10 years ago, I, you would have expected me to come on the
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.840]   podcast wearing a tin foil beanie cap with talk like that.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.680]   But I think these days it's prudent.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.040]   It's like, yeah, I have locks on the door in my house too.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.280]   And it's government you fear most?
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.040]   Well, well, no, I mean, it's government.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.040]   It's spammers.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.600]   It's there are any number of threats.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.680]   You just saying like on principle, it's just, it's just good practice to just do it because
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   it doesn't matter.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.040]   You don't know what it's going to.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   It's good hygiene.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.560]   I may not know every possible threat, but I do know a number of pretty stupid, easy things
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.040]   that you can do to reduce the likelihood that those threats will cause bad things to happen.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.760]   The other way to do it is how I do Facebook and how I do email, which is just assume
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.120]   it's public and not put anything that I wouldn't want to be public on the service.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.360]   But even with that, I think there are risks involved.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.200]   I mean, whoever you connect to, you just said that you primarily connect to people that
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.040]   you know in real life.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.440]   And even though you're not specifically saying, here's the information about my bank account
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.200]   or here's information about my wife or my kids, the fact that you've connected to people,
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.520]   that you have some kind of real world connection with, something could theoretically be gleaned
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.480]   from that that you might not want.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.760]   Well, and that's one problem with Facebook is that it doesn't seem to be constrained
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.400]   just to the people you connect with anybody, any application they run, then has access
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.680]   to you as well as them.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.040]   I mean, obviously Facebook is a sieve.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.520]   And let's not forget one thing.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.520]   What's that?
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.360]   It all comes out in discovery.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.400]   I don't know what that means.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.880]   It's a pain.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.720]   Any time there's a lawsuit, they go through this thing called discovery.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.960]   People said, and they just grab everything they can and they go through all of it and
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.160]   say, well, this is what's important.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.240]   And by the way, look at this weird stuff Leo.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.480]   Let's throw that out.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.840]   Throw it out into the public domain.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.060]   It's the thing of how people that put at the bottom of their email confidential agreement
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.060]   at the bottom of their email.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.040]   I'm like, if you like, why did you just waste three paragraphs?
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.720]   At the bottom of email, again, assume everything's public.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.240]   Don't spam me with your legal notice.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   That cracks me up.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.240]   Do not share.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   This is between you and me.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.520]   You, me, Google, and whoever else you see, see it on this email.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.360]   But now I'm getting a little depressed because--
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.360]   That's the one you're talking.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   It's a liquor talking.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   That's the more I have another drink.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   I'm so depressed.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   It'll make you feel a lot better.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.520]   It always cheers me up.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.800]   No, I'm a little depressed because now I can't.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:48.320]   It sounds like I can't reasonably use any of these things like Facebook, Gmail, Twitter,
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   all the stuff I like.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   Are you doing that much illegal stuff that you need to wear?
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   I don't know.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   That's the Eric Schmidt argument.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   I'll just ask you.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.000]   If you don't do anything wrong, what do you have to fear?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   But obviously--
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   That's bogus.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.280]   And he shouldn't ever say that because he's so paranoid.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.360]   But let me bring up some of that little statement at the bottom of some emails.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.560]   The reason that that's there, yeah, it looks kind of stupid.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:14.720]   But if there's, again, another legal situation that occurs, you can be kind of taking off
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   the--
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   Is it insulate you?
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   Does it somehow protect you?
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.720]   No, no.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.440]   What it does is if you actually violate that little statement, in other words, you got the
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   wrong email.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440]   You bring it out to somebody.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.720]   They just throw you on the stand and say, well, this is actually legal.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.560]   And you apparently are a lawbreaker by doing this.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.360]   So you're now impugned.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.640]   I mean, everything that we do in this country has got some legal angle.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   I got my lawyer right here.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.960]   Is that going to protect me if I put the thing at the bottom of the email?
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.960]   It's not going to protect you.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.640]   It's going to impugue somebody else.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.560]   He says it doesn't do doodily squat.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.120]   I think it's the eternal art that they use in law.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.800]   It sounds like John's not saying that it actually does something.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   But it does.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.040]   It gives you leverage on the witness stand to take somebody down and say, exactly.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.760]   It's more-- it gives you a tactical edge if something actually goes to trial and you have
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.240]   someone on the stand and you're able to stay.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   I feel so.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   And I feel.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.440]   I only imagine how normal people feel.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   What?
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   I feel like the record's working on these guys.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.440]   You feel insane.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   I feel insane.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   I feel insane.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   I feel like you're laughing.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   You're just wondering how you feel.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.480]   And it's just really bad.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.440]   It's like we're at his first drinking party.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.080]   It's like we're at a fret party and he discovered the keg.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.440]   Like guys, you don't understand.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.920]   I just feel so much.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.920]   It's an AA meeting.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.920]   Not you guys.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   I love you guys.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   It's just Facebook.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.160]   Man, it's just so bad.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:38.360]   I feel so helpless in the face of all this because it sounds like the really, the only
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.160]   prudent thing to do would be not use the internet at all.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.760]   Well, and I tell you, I was going to say that you're a little bit better equipped to
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.800]   deal with this than most people and that you are accustomed to living your life in the
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   public eye.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.840]   I gave up a long time ago.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   Exactly.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.400]   And unfortunately, my wife and kids have kind of got to suffer that brunt.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.480]   Well, and my four mistresses and my eight families and the family in Canada and all
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   of them.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   Four.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.320]   But the important thing is that even with the fact that you are accustomed to writing
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.680]   your life in Sharpie where you don't get to take anything backsees and instead all you
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.320]   get to do is right around it and try to do your best to say what you really want to
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.880]   say.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.680]   I mean, I'm like a million steps behind you, but I wonder the same thing.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   And I just wonder if you have any insight.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   I'm just saying that you guys look at, we've got Brian Brushwood.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.120]   Oh, Dr. Jenny, he's down.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.120]   We've got John C. Divour.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.000]   We've got kind of the, the, the, the, the creme de la creme of the technical world saying
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.480]   in effect to me.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.480]   Oh, the internet.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   Bad idea.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   I think so.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.480]   I think so.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.480]   I want to say that.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.480]   It's always been a bad idea.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.480]   It doesn't matter.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.680]   At the end of the day, you're still going to send emails.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   You're still going to do a show.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.680]   You're building an app.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   He's not getting off the internet.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   Hey, the camera, he's making, he's not stupid to do a show.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   Let me ask Jenny.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   Let me ask Jenny.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   Jenny, am I stupid to use the internet?
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.080]   I'm I stupid to use the internet.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.880]   You're not stupid to use the internet.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.880]   What do you, then what do we do?
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.080]   I mean, you've just described a situation that is pretty untenable.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.280]   So it's like, are you stupid to have a house or are you stupid to have a car?
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.480]   No, but you take precautions.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.720]   You take precautions in the way that you live your life with regard to this.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.280]   I don't lock my doors, by the way.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280]   I actually have.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.280]   Oh, no.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   I actually...
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.280]   I'm following Uncle Leo.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   I heard how old I'm outside.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.280]   He's got a lot of gear.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.280]   He's actually a cate.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.280]   He's actually a cate.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.280]   I actually have a way to...
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.280]   I think I get the point that we're all having.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.520]   It's that when you live your life on the internet, you live your life out in the public
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.820]   for everyone to see.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.400]   And the only time it really matters is when it keeps you from achieving something later
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   on.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   When you try to run for president, something comes back.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   Well, I'm not running for president.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   I'm not looking for work.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   I guess I'm screwed it.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   But no, I'm not.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   Well, but like specifically...
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.320]   No, no, I wish Jeff Jarvis were here because Jeff is a great advocate for living in public.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.160]   He's writing a book called Public Parts Right Now.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.120]   His point is if we all just live and look it, we all have the same freaking skeletons
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.120]   in our closet.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   We're no different.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   We don't.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   We don't have no other ones.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.560]   We have different ones, but they're roughly the same in general shape.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.680]   This steps almost exactly to where I was hoping it would.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.920]   Because the next story that we were...
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.520]   I wanted to talk about is that police recruits are now being screened for what they've said
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.520]   and done on social networks and Facebook.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.520]   I know.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   And those skeletons come out.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.840]   But this is the deal they make.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.720]   You apply for the job in law enforcement.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.960]   And the law enforcement people have to ask you, "Okay, if you want this job, they don't
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.480]   do it without your permission.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   We need your passwords.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.480]   We need to...
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   All of your aliases.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   Any names you've ever played.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480]   And you don't have to play the game.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.320]   You just say, "Well, I'm not going to apply for that job."
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   But you can't get the job without exposing yourself.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   But that's fair.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   But you're law enforcement.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.960]   There's a higher standard.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.960]   Yes.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.680]   Does your self and the information are just one?
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   Everything.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.480]   But if you're applying for a job...
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.680]   You just change your password later.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.680]   That's not a big deal.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   But...
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   Oh my goodness.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   That's crazy.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   You change your password before you even give it to him.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   You make a Mickey Mouse and say, "Here's my password.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   Mickey Mouse."
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   You go check it.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   You're ignoring my question.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   Okay.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:59.880]   It sounds like you're describing a Wild West internet where privacy is futile.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   Is it crazy goal?
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.040]   Can I say something?
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   Is that the case?
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   I say something.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   Yes.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   Oh, doctor.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   That's not why everybody says this.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   That's what Jarvis says.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   Jarvis says you might as well live in public.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   It's all live in public.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   It's not about privacy.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   It's about control.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.800]   The thing that people got upset about Facebook is when things are hidden and you don't know
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.720]   how to turn things on and off, it's about not having control over your content.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   You know what?
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.040]   If you don't want to get caught with dirty underwear, put clean underwear on and don't
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   get hit by a car.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.360]   That's the Eric Schmidt model, which is don't do anything bad.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.960]   Do what you want to do, but know that it might come out.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.960]   I mean, if you're a bad person, bad person, if you're a good person, you're a good person.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   Here's my feeling.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   My feeling is...
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.880]   My feeling is we all are the same.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.880]   We all are the same.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.800]   Yeah, smoked pot.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.200]   Yeah, I used acid.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.960]   Yeah, occasionally I like a donkey, but it's not that bad.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.040]   All right, you got that one on tape, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   We're all the same.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   Yes.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   We're all the same.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040]   Ryan did that last week.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.640]   A lot of people didn't smoke pot.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.400]   A lot of people didn't take drop acid.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   You know what, but I'm saying under my...
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.640]   And then once you say you smoke pot in public and make it a public thing, you're going to...
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.920]   Especially, say for example, you have a pilot's license.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   Look at the different.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.440]   You're going to be pulled or it's going to be raised to the roof.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.960]   Look at the difference between Bill Clinton who said, "Oh, I didn't inhale."
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.120]   And Barack Obama said, "You're hell yeah, inhaled."
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.760]   And you stole my idea.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.800]   I was trying to set this up from the very beginning.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.840]   I was going to say, like right now the news is OMG, they're looking in our Facebooks,
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   right?
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.520]   And what is going to become is that we're going to become bored with the secrets that
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   we discover.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   Exactly.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.520]   And then we're going to know that everybody...
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.200]   We have an entire generation of working adults starting right now, the 18 to 24-year-olds,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.920]   who have been living their life, their young adult life in public, who have all number
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.880]   of stories written about them, photos taken at parties, compromising stories, land-ways
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.880]   that they've said.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   And they're all going to have you in the same boat, right?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.160]   And it's going to just as...
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.600]   It used to be 20 years ago the idea of a president who smoked marijuana was insane,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.800]   just crazy talk.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.200]   And so you had to come up with some kind of hedge like, "Well, I smoked about it in
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   a year."
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.560]   But then now it's like, we're bored of that.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.560]   We're like, "Yes, yes, of course."
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.560]   Everyone you do.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.560]   Yeah, done.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.400]   You know, you can ask this stop for a second and at least throw something in.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   Yes.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.080]   I was talking from a technical group, California perspective.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:13.720]   There are plenty of people in Arkansas, Kansas, North Dakota that don't put all their pictures
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   online.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.240]   And you know, I will.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   That's just because they're behind.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   Yes, we will.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   Not necessarily.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.840]   If you have an idea, you've got to take a look around and say, "What?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.160]   This is crazy to do this."
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.120]   You know, I do do diligence on people all the time.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.840]   Some of you are going to do a meeting or something.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.280]   I'll go look them up on Flickr and I'll say, "Oh my God, this person is an...
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   It's a douche bag.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.880]   You can just tell by their photos."
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.080]   Well, that's huge.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.840]   John, John used to review software by looking at the box.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.840]   You guys laugh, but it's true.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.040]   We're going to take a break.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.440]   I don't know where it is.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   Go with that.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.160]   I think how you do how you review software by looking at the box.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:57.000]   I think to tie it in a bow, I'm of Leo's camp that you live your life on the record.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.640]   You've always lived your life on the record.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.440]   The record changed a little bit.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.760]   And I think we're going to see the world more warts and all from more.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.240]   And that's a good thing in the long run.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.240]   I think so too.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.440]   No, it's a bad thing.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.440]   No.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.840]   It'll keep us from these unrealistic body expectations.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.600]   You think, yeah, exactly.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.600]   On these unrealistic moral standards.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   Okay, there it goes.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   When old Dr. D...
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   I already have the picture of that Leo.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.320]   When old Dr. D is on the internet.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   Exactly.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.320]   Why have nothing on it?
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.480]   When you, JJ, I was so impressed.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.600]   You did the parody of the old Spice Guy and you're topless.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.680]   And you know, you're not exactly Paris Hilton.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.920]   I've lost 14 pounds, I can do it again right now.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.280]   Look a little bit better than last time.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   But you know what?
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   I have another day.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   I loved it.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.400]   And everybody loved it that you did it because you were you.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.480]   And everybody says, yeah, I got man boobs too.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.920]   Big deal.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.080]   And it's not...
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   I don't do that.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   All right.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   And big deal.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.280]   No, but my very serious point is, and I'm with you, Brian, on this, is that that's...
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.520]   I think that's going to be progress when people just go, this is how we are.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.520]   And it's not bull crap.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.760]   This is a passive attitude toward privacy, which is going to ruin this country.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.080]   That's why people are walking through that x-ray device.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.240]   They don't give a crap that they're getting essentially a chest x-ray.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.240]   I got a violin.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   And they get patted down and their nuts get grabbed.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240]   Nobody can play.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.720]   I have my nuts grabbed and I was not excited about it.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   It's going to be too good.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   Look, look, no.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   Okay, all right.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   Let me say two things.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.520]   First of all, first of all, I'm with you on the x-ray thing.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.640]   If I have to choose between the peep show and getting felt up, I always choose being felt
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.640]   up.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.640]   It's awkward.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.640]   I'm going to do it.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.840]   And that's the way in evasion of privacy you want to make them feel bad.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   That's right.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   That's right.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.040]   You are grabbing my junk and it's awkward for both of us and that's how it should be.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.280]   But let me say what I'm trying to say about the warts and all and understanding who people
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   are.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.600]   This is a manifestation of the high definition culture that we're joining into.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.800]   And it's not just our privacy on Facebook.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.000]   It's the fact that we watch high-def TV and you can see the zits on people.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.400]   You can see the makeup that Jay Leno is wearing on the Tonight Show.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.440]   Because the truth is the way they actually are.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.680]   In the first hundred years of media, it polished people.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.040]   It made it, it lied about people.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.600]   And I think that we all agree that the magazines and television and movies created a false
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.280]   standard that, that was unattainable and has caused great pain for normal people for
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.360]   the last hundred years.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.480]   Media has misused its ability.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.880]   This is an opportunity for media to say, and this is kind of what we do here.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   Boy, this is warts and all media if you ever have.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.320]   This is like false argument.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.000]   You're equating somebody's having a lot of makeup on on a TV show with 250 lines scanned
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.440]   with the invasion of personal privacy.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.120]   No, no, no, I'm not.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.480]   I'm not because I am fundamentally opposed to the, to the X-ray machines.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.320]   And in fact, I don't know, they had recently, or is it coming up Wednesday, November 24th,
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.640]   2010 is national opt out day.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.960]   Now most people don't know on the X-ray machines, you can always opt out.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.440]   All you have to say is I opt out and then they give you a pat down search.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.520]   And if we all did it, I do that all the time regardless.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.080]   Well, listen, maybe, I know when I just flew here this weekend, I wore the same sweatpants
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.920]   I wore last week to go to LA.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.880]   This year, this weekend when I came in, he's like, oh, they just changed the rules this
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.880]   week.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.640]   Do you want a private screening or do you want us to patch you down out here?
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   And I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   He's like, well, do you want us to take you in the back room or do you want us to do it
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   out here?
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   What does it entail?
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.040]   I have to go in your waistband, put my hand down your pants.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.560]   I'm like, do it out here.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.600]   And, and I stood in front of everybody and he didn't.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.600]   What's the alternative?
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.600]   Can I go through a machine?
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   The alternative is for him to go in the back room and pat.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.520]   He's going to put his hands down your pants no matter what.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.520]   He did.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.520]   Yes.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.240]   And I said, I'd rather have him do it out here in public because just what Brian said, he's
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   he's already ashamed to do it.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.600]   And I feel like he's not going to go as deep.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   When did this happen?
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.320]   This weekend, they're required to put their hands down your pants.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   Just change the rule.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.120]   Well, I put his hands on his hands.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm not like, I'm
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.120]   like, I'm not necessarily pulling it.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.520]   This is the, this is the one that my TSA is that you have to get.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.400]   If you're wearing spray pants or baggy clothing, I was wearing sweatpants.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   They're not baggy.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   They're sweatpants.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   He put his hand.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   This is my waistband.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.440]   Because I got to tell you, if I have to get my somebody hand on my pants, I'm not
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.600]   playing around the ring of my waistband and then pat it the front and then pat it my butt
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.600]   and then in my crotch.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.960]   And you know, it's all security theater.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.320]   It does absolutely nothing.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.680]   That's a part that kills me is that, is that for all of the federalization, for all
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.720]   this giant bureaucracy for the $5 that you have to pay for every single flight, going
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.000]   in and coming back everywhere you go, we get not 1 percentage point bump and it kills.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And he has embarrassed to do it.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   He says, sorry, like five times.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   He's like, I'm sorry.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Excuse me, but would you like that job?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   No.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Horrible job.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And I ran it.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Oh, you know what's funny is, is anyone who follows my Twitter feeds?
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Jenny, just, you know, I apologize.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I just want to apologize.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.480]   I didn't realize that this broadcast was going to be about warts, man booms.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.880]   I am so sorry.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.960]   I am so, so sorry.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.360]   I just don't know what to say later.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.920]   We'll talk about poking the queen, but first.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.800]   Or like cupcakes or something.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.960]   Cupcakes, matcha tea, anything.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.720]   Thank God you're here to just to lend us this just the slightest touch of class.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.200]   Can I just say one word though, please?
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   Israel.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.400]   Like, have any of you guys ever flown into or out of Israel?
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.800]   No, have you have you experienced that?
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.240]   Because I hear legends about it.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.920]   John, I flown in and out of Israel.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   Is it more secure?
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   It's more secure.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.640]   What do you think about your airport security versus ours?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.000]   Well, actually Brazil has a very similar structure.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.080]   Although Israel does a little more.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.680]   They just have a series of people probably less than the number of total TSA people who
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680]   have it, SFO.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.120]   And they all have their little stations and you go up there and they grill you.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   They grill you.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.880]   It's by the way, that's more effective than the search is looking you in the eyes.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.320]   Say, what brings you here?
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.320]   Why are you leaving?
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   But you know, what did you do?
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   Do you know what's wrong with that?
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.280]   It takes a lot of training.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.080]   And we aren't spending the money to train people.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.320]   You don't take any training, put somebody's hands down, oh, Dr. Sweatpants.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.880]   Trust me, that's training.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.800]   That takes no intelligence at all.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.000]   There you go.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.400]   So easy for you to say.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.360]   But Israel and I guess Brazil are willing to spend the time to train a true security
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.520]   force to interrogate people.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.400]   Essentially, that's what they're doing, right, John?
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.000]   Yeah, they know what to look for and they have, you know, they look for body language.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.800]   People sweating profusely as they're going through the line.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   That works much better.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.000]   Your attitude and you know, and they can also do some profiling, which isn't necessarily
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   a bad thing.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.600]   And you know, like that guy who had the underwear bomber guy, he had, you know, he looked like
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.160]   a nervous wreck, that character.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.160]   I mean, he was, he was sweating.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   He was nervous.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   He was shaking.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.240]   Well, and none of that's going to show up in this x-ray thing.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.480]   This x-ray thing is ridiculous.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   No, it's just bogus.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.520]   It's just that you know, don't forget that shirt off.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.520]   The ex homeland security bone head is the head of the consulting company that has set
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.560]   these things up to be dropped in every airport in the country.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.280]   The whole thing is corrupt is to sell more of these stupid machines so though these guys
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.280]   can make a killing.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.280]   These machines are overpriced.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.720]   They're probably not even safe.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.720]   Nobody knows.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:46.000]   UCSF has done a whole report on this questioning the technology from top to bottom.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.120]   It's a disaster and it's corrupt and you got shirt off involved.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.520]   Give me a break and nobody's saying anything.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.800]   I love when he gets fired up.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   I know.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   I love it.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.520]   John, John, I have never seen with you more than I agree with you today.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.520]   It's actually scandalous.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.720]   Nine days until national opt out day.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   Just for one day try it.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.640]   It's all really, really awkward.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.000]   I mean that's my policy every time.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.240]   I always refuse the x-ray and it's on principle.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.880]   It's not, you know, it's like I'll get a nigga right here if you dare me.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   But it's like it's on principle.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.680]   It's like I don't like the invasion of privacy.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.520]   It's not the government's job to be checking out my job.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.680]   So let me understand.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.160]   So we are allowed to refuse the x-ray.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   You always are.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   Any day.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.160]   But the alternative is a manual.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.160]   You can't refuse the pat down.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   No, you have to get something.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:31.240]   I'd like to say, so I've actually been refusing the scan since they introduced them in airports
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.080]   that I fly into and out of pretty regularly.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.480]   And I was having dinner with a friend last night and she said, "It's interesting to
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.360]   note that the people who are really, really upset about the pat downs, like emotionally
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.320]   involved in how upset they are, tend to be more guys than women."
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.960]   And I think there are plenty of theories that you could throw out as to why that's the case.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   But...
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   I was worried about getting excited.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   No, I can see...
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   I'm a little bit...
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.960]   Male or female.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.880]   I can see people being very sensitive to it.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.960]   And I'd say if you'd ever been abused or manhandled, it would probably be a very triggering
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   event.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   It would not be a pleasant event.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:14.680]   I also say that people were before the so-called more thorough or more extreme pat down techniques
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.720]   were put into place.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:22.200]   You know, I never felt like I was being groped inappropriately.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.080]   And it felt a lot more desirable than going through that scam, for sure.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.600]   Because I don't know what happens with the images and I don't know everything about the
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.960]   technology behind the machine.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:37.800]   I think that our country and our airports and our air travel business could do much better
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.640]   with more intelligent security.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:45.400]   But that being said, I'm not looking forward to flying the next time I have to fly because
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.760]   it sounds like things are just so much more invasive, unnecessarily invasive.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.040]   And I don't feel safer.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   And it was like a five day period.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.200]   I'm like, I wore these clothes five days ago.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   He's like, they just said a new rules this weekend.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.240]   And I'm like, wow.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.440]   Well I'm flying in a couple of weeks, so...
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   Oh, go naked.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.680]   I'm going to France now with the different France.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   Yeah, France.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   Did they give you a cigarette after they picked you?
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   That's right.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.920]   All right, I want to take a break.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.200]   We have a great cast of characters here.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.040]   Brian Brushwood from schwood.com.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   Dr. J.J.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   Oh, and J.J. Stone.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.040]   John C. Devorak from Boeing, Boeing.net and Jenny Jardin.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   It's great to have you all.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   This is a good conversation.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   And we will continue it in just a moment, but I want to remind folks that we couldn't do
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.040]   this show without the help and support of our sponsors, including the good folks at Citrix.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.040]   Actually, this is really good timing because you don't have to go anywhere with go to my
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   PC.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.880]   PC is actually awesome.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.960]   Whether you're a traveler or you just, for the holidays, this is a great time to take
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.640]   advantage of go to my PC and their free 30-day offer.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.760]   You can go home early, you can stay at home, you can do, you know, if you do go over the
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.200]   river and through the woods to grandmother's house, you can also use it there.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   Here's what you do right now.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.680]   Go to go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.720]   It'll take you about 30 seconds to install on your computer.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.080]   Now, wherever you go, Mac or PC, you log in to your secure account and go to my PC and
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.480]   there's your computer.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   Full screen, just like you're there.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.720]   You can send and receive email, run any program, full speed, access, any network resource, just
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   like you're there.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   It's really fantastic.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.960]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.160]   I see you nodding, Brian.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.160]   Do you use it?
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   Oh, dude.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.720]   And here's what I'd like to say because first of all, most of the people who are listening
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.440]   who have tried go to my PC automatically went ahead and bought it, right?
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.040]   Because it's obviously, it's amazing.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.120]   And if you buy a whole year at once, you get such a crazy discount.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.720]   You're insane if you don't buy it.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.440]   There's a bazillion people who think they will never need to use go to my PC.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.800]   Wait until you're out on the road and there's some file you need and you're trying to walk
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.880]   your wife through the steps to find the file.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.480]   And email it over to you.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   Okay.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.880]   I'll tell you, when you hit that situation and you will just in the back of your head,
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.560]   just remember promo code twit, go to my PC.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.560]   You can direct her.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.240]   All she has to do is go to go to go to my PC.com, download the client and then you take over
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   and she thanks you.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.720]   She goes back to whatever she's doing.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.160]   It has saved me so many times.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   I can't even count.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.160]   That's great.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.000]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Thank you, Brian.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.520]   So we'll stay a little bit with Facebook.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.320]   We didn't really resolve this email thing, but we'll cover it tomorrow.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.880]   I think we know now we don't want to use it.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.880]   Bottom law.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   We're the grumpy old men in the background.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   I don't know what it is.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   I don't like to know.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.960]   I thought this was kind of interesting that kids see kids are a little smarter maybe than
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.960]   we are.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.240]   They're doing the super log off now and I never heard of this until I saw this article.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.400]   This is amazing.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.720]   When they don't want, say they're going to apply for a job or for whatever reason they
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.600]   don't want somebody searching their Facebook profile, maybe you're applying for a job in
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.440]   law enforcement, you delete your profile, but it doesn't happen immediately.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.280]   You have a few, I think there's two weeks before it's actually deleted.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.560]   In that time it's not searchable.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   It's not visible.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.560]   No one can see it.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   It's as if you don't exist.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.920]   You do the interview, you do the job, you get the job, you get in school, whatever it is
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.560]   you're doing and then you reactivate your account and you're back to normal.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.560]   Clever.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.560]   This is brilliant.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.760]   This is why you can't beat the kids.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.600]   This is why your parental controls are all BS.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.560]   The kids will find them, nature will find a way.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.360]   Jurassic Park all over again.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.160]   And that is why we have to get rid of kids.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.960]   I was so in love with you till 20 years ago.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.160]   Actually it's encouraging because it shows to me at least those kids are sensitive to
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.480]   these issues and are thinking about it.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   You know what it reminds me of?
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:34.360]   It reminds me of in 1984, Winston has this realization that he could be a criminal, a
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:39.800]   corrupt institution and he runs into Julia who Julia grew up in this oppressive world.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   She's totally.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.680]   So to her, like, oh no, no, of course we all say we're virgins.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.360]   By the way, you want to go have sex.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.000]   And it's like that's what I feel like is happening here.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   It's sad.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.080]   Repression does breed that kind of thing.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.160]   It's kind of too bad.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.800]   Or I guess this is a weird form of repression.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.760]   Well, I mean, it's the article, what I liked about the article is that it pointed out that
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.360]   this is mainly a symptom of the fact that the privacy controls are too confusing with
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   Facebook.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.360]   This is a brute force solution to deal with it.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   I don't even think it's confusing.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.160]   I think maybe that's it, but I think also people don't trust them.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.720]   Yeah, because they change.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   Absolutely.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.040]   So you could set it private.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   You know what?
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.040]   It's free.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.320]   That's what you get when things are free.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   It's free.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.520]   If you want more of something painful.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.880]   Should the queen have created a Facebook page?
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.880]   No.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.880]   No.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.960]   Currently a mistake because immediately people signed up for her Facebook page and started
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   in vain against the monarchy and calling her names.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:43.000]   I want to ask John, why should she not have?
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Because you respect the throne so much?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.080]   I mean, what's the point?
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   It's like, who cares about the throne?
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   No, because it's stupid.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.720]   I don't think anyone should have a Facebook account.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   Why should she?
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   She's not going to be on it.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   That's bogus.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   It's just a lie.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.280]   Another lie from the monarchy.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.960]   You don't think she ever looks at it, do you?
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.560]   But he is fired up today.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.640]   But like the monarchy is silly.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.720]   It's silly to have a king rule that's even more silly that she has a Facebook account
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   with them.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.280]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.800]   It's straight out of Terry Gilliam.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.600]   Of course she should have a Facebook page.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.280]   And you should all go there and poke her.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.040]   By the way, can I ask a question of the group?
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.040]   Yes.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.000]   How are you doing with that bottle of rum?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Let's see the level.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Come on.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   All right.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   No, I got to see the bottle.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.200]   Oh, you guys aren't even, you got about an hour.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   You got to finish it.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   All right.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   I'm not having any more.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   Oh, please.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   I'm already.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   I'm in tears.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   You don't have to be able to pull it out.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   The stone you love him.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   So he's done.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.040]   As soon as he said donkey love, and I wasn't pouring him anymore.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.840]   Already, I've been in tears twice.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.040]   In one fight.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.360]   Amazon pulls the pedophile book after first defending it.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.280]   Now this is an interesting story.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.320]   It was self-published.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.760]   I don't even, it's disgusting.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.760]   It's on the face of disgusting.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.760]   Can we just all agree right now?
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   I think it should have its own Facebook page.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.440]   It has like three Facebook pages against it.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.440]   Actually, apparently.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.800]   With thousands and thousands of people against it.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.960]   So Amazon at first, when people said what, said, what did they say?
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.800]   They defended it as a free speech issue?
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.880]   What they said was, and I'll try to find the exact quote here, but essentially what they
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.560]   said is they say, look, we're not in the business of censorship.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.400]   We let everything, let me get the exact quote here.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.440]   Amazon believes it is censorship not to sell certain books simply because we or others
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.800]   believe their message is objectionable.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   Amazon.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.200]   Yeah, what does that say?
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   It's hilarious.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.560]   Amazon does not support a promote hatred or criminal acts.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.640]   However, we do support the right of every individual to make their own purchasing decisions.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.280]   Isn't that though what the First Amendment says?
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.920]   Is that we defend your right to say it however, reprehensible?
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.840]   There's general rules in society and even criminals in jail.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.040]   You don't mess with kids.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.040]   You can rob a bank.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.040]   So we're saying, yeah.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.040]   But you do not mess with children.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.040]   Right.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.640]   So it's so, I know that you're saying many a prison movie.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.640]   I guess.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   Just a thing.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   Pound that out.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   Pound it out.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640]   Pound it out, baby.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   That sounds like a hilarious.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   That, that's because we love you, Jenny.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.440]   Just jump in anytime.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   Fist bump when you want.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440]   Okay.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.000]   Do you feel left out, Jenny?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.040]   To me, the most reprehensible thing here is not the fact that this book existed.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.360]   I mean, welcome to the internet.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:19.640]   The internet has bad things on it, nor is it the fact that Amazon finally decided to
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.680]   pull the book, the Kindle book, the digital book from his shelves.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.160]   There's plenty of other stuff that they don't sell.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.520]   There are other, they don't, they pull pornography from the Kindle bookstore as well.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.440]   But the really reprehensible thing here was what certain blogs that at least from my end
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:43.840]   shall remain nameless did to ring as much traffic and faux concern trolling controversy
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.480]   as possible out of this.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.640]   There's a series of outraged editorials that were totally hollow.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.040]   The same kind of stuff like Anderson Cooper having Dr. Phil on to talk about the ravages
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.720]   of pedophiles on the internet.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   I don't have the stats in front of me, but I think all the reports that are out there
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:10.120]   show that children are so much more likely to be sexually assaulted by a parent or another
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.920]   family member or a friend of the family than they are for the ungulls.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.520]   There's a guy on the internet selling a Kindle book.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.360]   I've got more news for you.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:23.480]   This guy had sold like one copy before, you know, TechCrunch and these other blogs got
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.840]   on it and everybody whipped themselves into a frenzy and it was on Fox.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.400]   It was on CNN.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.400]   Come on.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   Zany, I love you.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   Come on.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   So, so what do you do though?
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.880]   I mean, Amazon did both, did everything.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.360]   So they guarantee you they did something wrong because they did everything.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.160]   They defended it, then they pulled it.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.680]   So, well, okay, well, and keep in mind that the defense was a policy and that policy
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.880]   got a big laugh from everyone because we were talking about a book about pedophilia.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.680]   But if it was a policy about violent video games, read it again and think about violent
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.320]   video games, read it again and think about the anarchist cookbook, read it again and
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.000]   think about, you know, catcher in the rye, any number of books that we've all decided
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.400]   that should be out there and it doesn't sound so silly.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.400]   Now in this case, it was a nothing book that was going nowhere that was written by a crack
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.320]   pot and possibly a criminal.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.400]   So, so you agree with Zany that the real culprit here is TechCrunch and the blogs that
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   made hay on us?
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.960]   I think we are the enemy here.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:19.200]   I think I think we're all a little piece of the the rabble rousers and I think Amazon
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   had a good policy.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.800]   So Amazon should not know they pull stuff as they pull pornography is there any point
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   now?
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   Right.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   Should they not pull anything?
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   No, no, no.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   Okay.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   First of all, it's not a hilarious policy.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.600]   I think it's a sensible policy, but that's not what happened here.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:38.000]   What happened here is we all gathered around with our pitchforks and our torches and we
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.560]   started marching towards Amazon and Amazon did the one thing that makes sense in the
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.320]   whole world, which is the anxious thing right off the top.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.000]   Yeah, understanding that this is considered to be one of the most reprehensible crimes
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   that we commit.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Of course.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   So if it wasn't that, that's the difference in it.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.240]   That's why I said like, I understand your point, but they pull books on how to cheat
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.600]   on tests.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   They pull books on.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.480]   I guarantee they don't do that on principle.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.160]   They do that because so it's a pitch broke.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.160]   So, but wasn't it appropriate?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.080]   I mean, I'm playing devil's advocate, but wasn't it appropriate for people who discovered
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.760]   this book to say, well, hey, Amazon, you have an inconsistent policy.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.000]   Is this not a reprehensible act?
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Should you not pull this book, Jenny?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.360]   I mean, doesn't that seem like a sensible thing to raise?
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.000]   Yeah, I don't understand why it was there in the first place because they refuse to
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.680]   sell titles that are far less effective that have nothing to do with the affiliate.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.040]   So then why is it inappropriate for sex or what?
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.080]   So why is it inappropriate for tech crunch to bring this up and say, well, look, you've
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.880]   got a crazy policy and why are you defending this book, which is horrible?
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:40.160]   Look, there's the difference between raising a concern over something that's a real threat
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.920]   and then just fapping traffic and that's kind of how it felt.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.920]   Okay.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   That's legit.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.920]   I was so worried about how to start to develop.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.000]   And interestingly, too, Apple has a very different policy in their bookstore.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.680]   And a lot of times people give Apple a lot of grief for having a very restrictive policy.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.880]   I don't think that this would have happened in the Apple bookstore.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.600]   I don't think it's happened in the Apple App Store.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   I think this is a very difficult thing for all these companies because they don't want
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:13.160]   to set themselves up as arbiters because that's a dangerous policy.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.160]   Its systems can be gained.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.480]   It sounds like on YouTube when porn goes up and you giggle like, oh, how does this porn
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   gets slipped up?
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.440]   Well, none of people clicked on and said this is violating whatever.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.480]   Wouldn't the most sensible policy be anything goes?
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:30.600]   This, you know, we don't, you know, we're not going to censor at all.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.600]   This is.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   No.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.080]   It's a lot like comments, right?
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:40.000]   So at Boing Boing, for a long time, we had wide open comments.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.840]   Anybody could post any comment they wanted while we were a smaller blog that made sense.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.840]   And that wasn't a big problem.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:52.360]   But as Boing Boing grew and the size of the network, the size of the community involved
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:58.160]   became exponentially larger over the years, that open policy, we hit a point when it was
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160]   no longer sustainable.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.640]   We cut comments down altogether and we replaced them with a system where we have real live
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.200]   human moderators that you could say, I wouldn't say that they're curating comments.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:15.280]   But if someone suggests something, you know, if somebody were to suggest an illegal act
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   like this, we'd take a look at that and think like, is this, is this harming the community?
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.280]   Is this potentially harming someone?
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.800]   Is it a personal threat to one of the editors?
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.440]   Is it something that makes us log on in the morning and feel really uncomfortable?
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:37.280]   Does it does it improve the experience for us and for our community or does it degrade
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   it?
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.320]   So it's a little bit different.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.080]   But I think in a nutshell, that's exactly the answer to your question.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.000]   That's why anything can't go.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.200]   That's why you took comments off your blog, Leo, because if anything goes, you end up
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:59.000]   with this chaos, this chaotic mess that like Jenny said, was ruining the experience.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.720]   This is a very, you can't allow it.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.080]   I have comments on my blog.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.040]   We took comments off the Twit webpage.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.440]   But this is a very difficult thing that all internet publishers are dealing with right
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   now.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.280]   Either you do what Moot did at 4chan and say, whatever you want, right?
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.880]   And you see what happens at 4chan or you try to do what Boing Boing did.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.960]   And I think Boing Boing has done it very sensibly.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:26.000]   But you're also, Amazon is in a difficult position because.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And for what is with leather?
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I think it's very, very clear.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.960]   This is a part of the book about seeing a book on pedophiles and saying, hey, this
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.960]   is not a sock.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   You get out of here.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.480]   How difficult is that?
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.720]   No, that you shouldn't have let up.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.720]   I agree.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   I'll give him John a pitch for it.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:44.200]   But you do have to make difficult decisions in many cases about.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.240]   But this is what I mean, would you put, let's say, a white supremacist book up there?
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   Me?
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   Anybody?
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   It's always the pedophiles first and the racist.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   It is.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.280]   He's your both extremely reprehensible things.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.280]   Yes.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.640]   At the same time, I'm okay with racism over pedophilia, pedophilia.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.720]   Their children, their innocence, adults have the right to do what they want to do.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.720]   They're adults.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.040]   So I'm just pointing out that there's a racist, racist, racist, right to lynch you.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.080]   No, no, no, you have the right to do what it's like.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   But what about minecom?
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080]   You have the right to do what it's like.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   Right about minecom.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   Have the right to do what it's like.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.520]   Why don't I say the book was guy how to lynch people.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:21.760]   Well, no, no, no, no, let's just say minecom because it's racist, but it has a, it's a
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.760]   great, it's an important historical.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.840]   I was hoping you'd bring up not to do that.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.440]   Where's the clear?
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.840]   It's the drinking game.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.880]   God was loved once again.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.240]   Well, that's why they call it a law because it may not be violated.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.680]   It's a neuralator.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:40.760]   But here's what I like about this discussion is that all of this is happening on the Internet
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.200]   with private individuals running their own little fiefdoms.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.920]   I mean, this are not fiefdoms, I guess, individual city states.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.440]   You know, you guys know I'm an unapologetic, one of those misty eyed libertarians.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.600]   And the Internet is the closest thing that exists to a libertarian and archical society.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.960]   And it's great to see everybody handle this universal problem in their own individual
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.960]   ways.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.800]   And yes, Amazon's grappling with it.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.320]   They have their own unique take that they're, that they're dealing with it.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.320]   But thank goodness.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   It's not the government.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   It's something we do with it.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   It's something that we all have to deal with.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.760]   And it is a very difficult challenge.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.520]   Some people have taken comments off their blogs.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:16.120]   Some people moderate comments and people let anything go.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.600]   I think 4chan is a really good example of what happens when anything goes.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.280]   That's that's talking about warts and all.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.000]   I mean, that's that's like you look at pure honesty from.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.160]   I think it's great that 4chan exists.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.160]   I wouldn't I don't.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.160]   We need we need it.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   You will.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.720]   I went to see slash B slash the other day just because I I'd never been.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.040]   And my wife was I was in bed.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.040]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.120]   This is going to have another drink Leo.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.120]   Come on.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:45.520]   And of course, I'm sitting here going, Oh my, oh my, oh my, and my wife looks over.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.740]   And she doesn't under she there's no way to say, Oh, no, this was a recent what there's
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.900]   no answer for this.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.160]   I'm reading the articles.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.160]   Honey.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.960]   I'm reading it for the.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.440]   I seriously I'd never been there.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.440]   And I was curious.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   Well, what happens there?
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:03.160]   And of course I got caught immediately because that's how I am.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:07.000]   Now of course now 4chan is right now, D Dossing tumbler, which is D Dossing back.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.120]   I don't even understand what that's all about.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.320]   Is 4chan a blight?
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:14.120]   I mean, or is it just a good place to have some of these people go?
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.960]   Hey, I guess I need to even empire better to have them in that little pool than running
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   the streets.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.200]   I even mood is embarrassed sometimes with what's going on there, but I could commend
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:27.840]   him for embracing openness and unapologetically.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.840]   I mean, no compromise.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.000]   No compromise.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.480]   No compromise, especially when the internet is everybody wanting to be nice to everybody.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.200]   There's like a whole nice to the movement where people feel like that would be nice
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.800]   which means they're fake and they lie to people's faces all the time.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.880]   There's not that much brute force honesty out there and people just are being real with
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.880]   each other.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.600]   Are we reading the same websites?
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.680]   Hey, of course there's websites out there on, but I mean, there's a lot of grandstanding
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.440]   when you're on the internet and people don't want to say anything about people and it's
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.440]   weird.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   Man, I'm talking about person to person.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.280]   I'm not talking about company and business.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.040]   I'm talking about people.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.400]   I think I need to spend more time.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   You should hang out with me.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.560]   The internet is abroad and varied place.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   I think we can agree.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   And where you're at.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.400]   That room has a very specific request.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   They'd like to see us get away from pedophilia, bestiality, drugs, pornography, alcohol, nazis
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   and start in religion.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   Oh, good choice.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   Show's over.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   Show's over.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.200]   And by the way, I'm going to apologize to the chat.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.560]   It keeps crashing and so I'm not on it anymore.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.560]   Okay.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   Somebody cut the power on.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.480]   What is the most taboo topic?
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.880]   Is it religion?
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.880]   You know what?
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.280]   I think it's talking about how many employees Amazon is going to hire for this big Christmas
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   season coming up.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.480]   15,000, isn't it?
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   Yes, it's insane.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.040]   What a segue.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   And in fact, he's good.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   Hold on.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   That's a lot.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.040]   He's good.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.040]   I was rather proud of that.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.960]   Specifically, and the number that staggered me, and of course, Amazon has a lot of people
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.160]   coming in, but everybody does.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.400]   And I'm going to try to track down the actual number here.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:01.200]   Retailers will add between 550,000 and 650,000 jobs this holiday season, according to an updated
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   forecast from the National League.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.440]   Excuse me, aren't we still in like an economic crash?
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.120]   Isn't unemployment almost 10%?
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.320]   I wonder who's going to spend this money.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.280]   Wasn't, weren't sales down last holiday season?
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   They were.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   They were.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.560]   Amazon said this is more than we brought in last year.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   Yes.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   Sales were down last year.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   And sales are down last year.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.960]   Do you know what some reason think that it's going to be a banner year?
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   Here's, here's my theory.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.360]   A little bit of, I could be totally bogus.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.800]   Let's say money is tight.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.480]   If money is tight and you want to stretch your Christmas dollar, the farthest you possibly
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.560]   can, are you going to get up and drive out to the mall and pay retail prices?
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.320]   Or are you going to go online, plan in advance and figure out how to get the most for your
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   bucks?
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.320]   And if you're going to do that, where you're going to spend it?
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.320]   I did see a survey.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.600]   It might be a little bit of dancing on the Titanic, but I did see a survey that said the
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.920]   people, middle income people are going to spend less.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.760]   It's the wealthy who plan to spend more of this year.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.320]   So the people who have money are going to spend more of it this year.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:59.600]   Maybe that's interesting because I'm angling for somebody to give me a MacBook Air for Christmas
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   and I know that they're loaded.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   Well, I'll make sure Uncle Leo has all our addresses.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.160]   If you've been a good boy, John, I'm sure it'll be true for you.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.680]   Not saying who.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.760]   Uncle Leo, of course.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   Who else?
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.320]   That's where I got this one from.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.320]   John.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   I'm not giving it back.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.360]   I mean, I don't want to jump ahead and score stories, but didn't Google have like some big
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.840]   significant story that happened to me?
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.840]   Let's talk about that.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.280]   That is actually a holiday, a holiday festive holiday story.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.600]   It was a bit of a surprise that the Google didn't they?
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   Well, you know what's interesting.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.440]   Well, I'm going to save it because I want to mention Squarespace quickly and then we'll
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.440]   get to it.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.440]   Oh my goodness.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.120]   I almost had an ESP moment and when we were talking about DDoS, I almost said and I didn't
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.280]   know who was coming up on next in the break, I was going to say, do you know who couldn't
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.280]   be DDoS?
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   That's a good point.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   Squarespace.com.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:49.160]   One of the things I love about Squarespace, they use that Java virtual server technology,
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:54.840]   then they, it's, I don't really fully understand it, but when you go to a Squarespace site,
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.400]   you're not going to just one server.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.960]   You're going to an amalgam of servers and as bandwidth is required, Squarespace responds.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.120]   When I, you know, Paul Therot's been having such trouble with his, his, his website, the
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.920]   super cipher, when it's like, keep saying Paul, just set up on Squarespace.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.040]   Just do yourself a favor, Squarespace.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:15.480]   The secret behind exceptional websites is both hosting and software.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:19.520]   Really exceptional content management system running on Squarespace.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.680]   The only you have to do is go to squarespace.com and take a look to start with the templates,
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:27.440]   60 plus designer templates, but then the beauty of it is you're not stuck with a cookie cutter
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.440]   site because immediately you can start customizing it to your heart's desire.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.000]   And I mean really customizing it.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.080]   Squarespace gives you the chance to make a unique site, looks like a professional did
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.360]   it, but it's just drag and drop mouse clicks.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.920]   If you know CSS, of course you could do even more, but you don't have to.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.160]   You really get a lot of control over your site.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.040]   So start with a great template.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.440]   You can import your existing content very easily.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:55.400]   Squarespace has importers for all the major blog and website APIs, including movable type,
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.040]   WordPress type pad and blogger.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:02.040]   You know, the easiest thing to do, go to squarespace.com/twit and click the green button, try it for free
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.040]   right now.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.960]   All you have to do is give them a site name, a password, an email address so you can recover
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.640]   the password if you forget it.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.720]   Do a little capture here, no credit card, nothing you've got 14 days to play with Squarespace.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.400]   And really see what you like.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.320]   Alex Lindsay was telling me the other day he was in a restaurant that didn't have a website.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.600]   So he started with squarespace.com, set up a website and said, "Here's a password.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.480]   If you decide you want a website, I've done like 90% of the work for you while I was eating
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.640]   lunch."
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   It's that cool.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   It's that slick.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.640]   It's that easy to use.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.640]   I want you to give it a try.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:35.080]   If you go to squarespace.com/twit, do the two week, please do the trial.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.320]   We arrange for that all of our advertisers for trial so that you can try before you buy.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.320]   We know you're smart.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.080]   We're not trying to sell you a pick and a poke.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.280]   It's best to try it first, but if you decide you like it, sites start at $12 a month.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.400]   It's hosting software, everything.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.240]   Very secure because they do the updates regularly.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.480]   And if you use the offer code Twitch, you'll get 10% off that price for the life of your
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.520]   site.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.080]   Many great sites use squarespace.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:02.240]   If you want a tour, go to the examples page at squarespace.com and see all the fantastic
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.240]   sites, squarespace.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:13.080]   A lot of photographers, great portfolio templates, a lot of non-profits, squarespace.com/twit.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.040]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.440]   So if you worked at Google and you were a very nice engineer and you said, "I'm going
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.720]   to take a job at Facebook."
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.520]   They might offer you $3.5 million, not to?
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.520]   What?
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.440]   Is that what happened?
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   Yes.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:29.960]   The other story that I know you were thinking about was a memo.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:30.960]   It's a lesser story.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   I want to hear about this one.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   $3.5 million.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.800]   Well, this is the interesting thing.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:40.120]   The guy who leaked the memo about the 10% raise and the $1,000 bonus to all Google employees
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.000]   was fired immediately.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   Merry Christmas.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Merry Christmas.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   Fired immediately.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.520]   And Google made a point of saying we fired that, guys.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.520]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.520]   Hold on a second.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.520]   Leo?
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.520]   Then?
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.440]   Oh, there's no reason for privacy or all this other crap.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.160]   What difference does it make if you leaked the memo?
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.160]   Well, all right.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   Let me put it this way.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:03.320]   If you're going to leak a corporate memo, don't use your Gmail account to do it.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   Bye.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.480]   So, when Jing is tuned, might have been a little bit of a mistake.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:11.360]   Did they really expect that not one person would say, "By the way, I got a $1,000 bonus
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.360]   or by the way?"
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:18.040]   They thought that that it said on the memo confidential Google only and I guess they
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.240]   took it pretty seriously.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   Wow.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.520]   So, it got a sense.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.520]   It becomes a story.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.520]   Anything Google does becomes a story.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.000]   But that's such a positive story.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   It's a good story.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   Why don't you watch that?
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.200]   $20 million is going to cost them to give every employee $1,000.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   About a billion dollars to give $10% raise.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   And now we're finding out that the 10% raise is only for the super new meraries.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.440]   Executives getting 30%.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.080]   Wow.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.960]   Maybe that's the part they didn't want out.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   Executives getting 30%.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.920]   And this guy, now I don't know how true this is, you know, but this guy, they say $3.5 million.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.760]   So he wouldn't go, "There's a big brain drain."
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.600]   Google losing a lot of people to Facebook.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.480]   This isn't the same guy they fired, which is the guy that they would say.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:01.080]   You know, it would have be funny if Larry Ellison offered him a job.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:07.840]   Did you guys read that thing this week about how Google is basically hiring servants for
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.840]   their employees?
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.840]   Oh my God.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.920]   Do things like clean the cat litter box.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   Are you serious?
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   I sold your laundry.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.640]   Where is that article?
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.640]   Well, they...
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:21.080]   Turn your compost pile, whatever it is that people do up there in Silicon Valley, where
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.080]   you guys are.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.800]   I know at the Googleplex, you know, they have a dry cleaning thing.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.160]   So you just drop off your dry cleaning.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:31.000]   This is actually like servant labor that you can just give them.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.200]   You have credit points that you can cash in and ask these people to...
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   You love it.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   This sounds like slavery, Uncle Leo.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   No.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   No.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   Slavery.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.200]   These people are getting paid, right?
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   Shillings.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.840]   They're being paid, yeah.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.000]   It's a job, O.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   It's like mechanical...
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.280]   Mechanical Turk, but for physical tasks that involve your house.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.840]   Are you saying there should be no menial jobs, Owen?
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.520]   I'm just saying a megacorp shouldn't have kitty litter in the office that needs to be
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.520]   turned off.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:59.520]   Well, I don't know if it's a private...
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.520]   It's like a home.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.520]   It's like a home.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.520]   It's like a home service.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.520]   It's not a...
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.520]   It's like back at your home.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.520]   Okay.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.520]   Or wherever you want.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.440]   Well, I just need to go to the job of Google apparently.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.760]   Most people work for Google, but they can be checked out like a library.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.280]   Yeah, it sounds to me like...
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.800]   They're contractors, so it's a service.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.480]   I'm blanking out of the name of the service.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.400]   It sounds to me like this is a time share for servants.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.880]   Yeah, but not for servants.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.360]   Servants is a bad word.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.240]   Speaking of which, you see that Ask Jeeves is going out of business.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   Is it?
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Is it?
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   Is it?
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   Is it all the way down?
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.240]   I just arrived them the other day.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.240]   It's all over for ask.com.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.240]   They're folding up the...
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.240]   We got the answer.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   Thank you, ask.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.040]   They say we can't compete against the Google.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   Wow.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.400]   It's of course...
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.160]   What's his name from ICM?
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.160]   The big guy.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.160]   The big guy.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.320]   Can't remember his name.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.680]   Who bought them and said, "Well, we thought at the time that Google was perhaps..."
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.680]   We're a fad.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.240]   A fad, right for the taking.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.240]   Anybody could beat them.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.360]   Well, they never offered any other services.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   Like Yahoo has...
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   I've been looking at Blecho and I like it.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.360]   I like Blecho.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.160]   I don't like the name, but I like Blecho.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.160]   How do you spell that?
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.720]   K-K-O.com.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.080]   They're calling it slash tags.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   And so what do you do?
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.080]   How do you use Blecho?
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   I'm here right now.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.040]   You use it like Google, but I mean it has a few...
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.640]   These slash tag angle.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.680]   And it gets you slightly different results, but it doesn't get you worse results.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.800]   So the idea would be, for instance, I've created a couple of slash tags myself.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:29.640]   There's one that's a slash a tech news and there's one that's slash Twitch.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.760]   So I'll do a search, let's say, for Google.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:37.360]   And instead of, I'll say Google slash tech news, and then it uses my sources and my
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.920]   sources only for the search.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.360]   So then it'll search through my canonical tech news sources.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.800]   So I'm only going to get Google tech news stories.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:51.920]   Similarly, if I use slash Twitch, it would only be cases where people with, like you,
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.080]   Brian, with your blog or anybody would...
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:57.120]   So it works for Twitch mentions Google.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.120]   So I think that that's kind of...
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.120]   So you have to customize.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   You have to set up your own...
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   This is why it's a slop.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.120]   Yes.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:09.240]   Because you can find other people slash tags, but it's too much work.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.240]   We are lazy.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.400]   But is it the kind of thing where they just haven't built the right vocabulary of slash
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.400]   tags?
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.800]   Like eventually, like I just typed in xray backscatter slash rights and I didn't get anything interesting
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   in here.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.800]   Because there's no slash rights.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:22.800]   Right.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.880]   But are these universal backslashes that people can set up?
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.760]   Well, users set them up and apparently they've got a vocabulary.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.760]   You can follow users.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.280]   It's a kind of a social...
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   You know, I...
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   It's too much work.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   It's too much work.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   Too much work.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   And then...
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   What?
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   Sulu is back.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.280]   What are you talking about?
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   I saw you.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   Sulu!
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   I could see you.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.120]   I totally agree that slash tags are fascinating.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.120]   What?
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.120]   Exactly.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.880]   You should be here and have some of this.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:50.880]   Okay.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.880]   And bring the yellow thing.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.880]   Send your lim...
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.760]   Hey, how are you guys doing on that bottle?
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.960]   She looks just like a roll-oam.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.800]   But she looks just like that.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.800]   Yes.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   Same thing.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   Let me...
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   Go ahead and do it, Jenny.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   Let me just...
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   Yes.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.800]   Let me dissolve the two.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:06.800]   Separated at birth.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   Dissolve the two.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   Isn't this the character that's on the future drama show?
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   Yeah, that's Dr. Zoidberg.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.480]   Dr. Zoidberg, that's who it looks like.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.040]   It's Dr. Zoidberg, Sathulu?
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.800]   No, he's the lobster man.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.800]   Okay.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:18.800]   Ah!
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   All right.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   Enough foolishness.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.360]   Then we should end the show.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.920]   So we sort of jumped ahead right here.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   But there's some other big news.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.920]   There's no order.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.920]   You think there's order?
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   There's no order.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   There's no order.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.920]   But here's chaos.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   Call of Duty Shatters, Video Game Sales Record.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:36.080]   $360 million for one day.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.840]   And you know what's great about this release?
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.480]   This is Call of Duty Black Ops.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.480]   Black Ops.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.560]   With no offense on it.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.560]   Oh my gosh.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:45.000]   I went to Owen for the comments.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.920]   And it's Leo with the steel.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.920]   All right.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.640]   I'm waiting for White Ops to come out before I open up the stink.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.640]   Okay.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.160]   But you know, the thing with Call of Duty Black Ops is that...
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.400]   Can I have some more?
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:59:01.880]   It had been the case where Infinity Ward was the "real developer" for Call of Duty.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.200]   And then they all walked out.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.440]   And then Treyarch would be the app bat.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.320]   Whenever they had a major release, Treyarch would come in and do a...
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:13.120]   What did you do in Infinity Ward do Modern Warfare 2?
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.520]   That's where things got interesting.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.040]   For me personally is what I'd like to think of relatively hardcore PC gamer.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:21.760]   I really disliked Modern Warfare 2, I felt like.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:25.320]   Well Modern Warfare 1, Call of Duty 4, was very, very clever.
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:29.040]   It had an engaging story and a big twist that really hit you in the gut.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.040]   And it was believable.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.600]   And I loved every minute of it.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.040]   In Infinity Ward's next release, Modern Warfare 2 was just silly.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.280]   It was a Michael Bay movie.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:39.000]   Now, for some people, Michael Bay movie means a good thing.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.240]   I'll go see Transformers 2.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.600]   For me, it's just silly.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   And it's like, I don't care.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.800]   Everyone's made of rubber.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:47.200]   And so what's interesting is Treyarch kind of stepped up.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.720]   They wrote an interesting story for this.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.440]   When I still haven't played it, I'm looking forward to it.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.520]   It's all hearsay from where I'm coming from.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.320]   But I'm looking forward to do it.
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.520]   But it would be interesting if Treyarch stole some of the Jeep cred on this title.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.960]   Well, I'll wait for all the reviews to see exactly where it is.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.600]   I feel the exact opposite of Brian.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600]   All right.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.200]   You like Modern Warfare 2?
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.320]   Yeah, I like Infinity over the other one.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:14.560]   And I feel like the other Call of Duty is living off the lore of Modern Warfare.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.200]   So the game plays different.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.200]   Forget the story.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.280]   I play it for the multi-user, the online experience of killing my friends.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.280]   The story is the story.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.680]   You play through it in a day and then you get online for months and a year at a time
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.280]   waiting for the next Call of Duty to come out.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.280]   And that is true.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   If what you want is--
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   So--
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   And for that--
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.280]   That's what most people play it for.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.280]   And for the--
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:35.640]   The most significant difference is the new Black Ops has dedicated servers.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.720]   And Modern Warfare 1 did not.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.720]   And that was a big thing.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   That was a big issue, wasn't it?
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720]   It really, really was.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.120]   Because it was very easy to hack.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.560]   You know, though, I mean, 360 million in one day, whatever you say, Modern Warfare 2
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.080]   obviously was so successful that the sequel was huge.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.080]   And bigger than any--
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.880]   Now, by the way, a movie's $10.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.880]   This game is $60.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.680]   Nevertheless, bigger than any other entertainment first day in history.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.040]   But the level of experience you get is so much more immersive.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.920]   So I'm just talking about raw dollars.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   Right.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.920]   Obviously, you get more for $60.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   Of course.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:12.600]   But you can't say $360 million because that's really, you know, 60 times 60 or whatever it
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600]   is.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.640]   Now, on the flip side, we have $360 million, very big number.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.800]   There's another Microsoft number, maybe not so big.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   I don't know.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.520]   You know, I'm not sure because Microsoft has not said how well.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.920]   And this Windows Phone 7, I gave one to Owen.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   And I think I kept it.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   Do I not give a bad idea?
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   I want to tell--
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.920]   Gabe is the wrong word.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   I love it.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920]   No, no, no, no.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920]   You said Gabe.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   We already have that here, too.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920]   I heard Gabe.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.920]   I temporarily--
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.920]   Well, it's OK.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920]   I'll trade you for this.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   Oh, God.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920]   This is all going downhill.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   Which one do you want?
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.360]   Let's talk about that Windows Phone 7.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.840]   Unfortunately, I'm not there.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840]   I would have been.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840]   I like it, Joe.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.840]   I like it.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.840]   But--
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.840]   Yeah?
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840]   Do you?
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.840]   I mean, seriously.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840]   Well, OK, here's my thought on an Owen.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.400]   You can maybe corroborate or deny.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.160]   But it's-- you know, this is the same hardware as you're going to get in a Samsung Galaxy
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.240]   S phone running Android, essentially.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   And so, gigahertz processor.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.600]   Very good camera, by the way.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.080]   I would say as good as the iPhone camera.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.080]   Five megapixels.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   Very good camera.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.600]   I think very intuitive, simple operation.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.200]   Very intuitive and smooth.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.640]   Oh boy, the first thing you feel is this is responsive.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   Way more than Android.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.920]   I'd have that over in Android.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   I'd start my iPhone.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.680]   Well, if all you care about is responsiveness.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.680]   Yes.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.680]   Well, I could flip through.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   I could find everything.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680]   It was nice.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.680]   It was--
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.160]   And I gave this to a couple of people with no smartphone experience.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.840]   And that was my interesting observation is they quickly groked this.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.160]   There's a lot of little things.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.160]   They groked it?
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160]   Did they break?
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.720]   They groked it.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.920]   They understood it, John.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.920]   Oh.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.640]   I think that what I'm seeing is Microsoft's strategy and ad campaign now makes sense.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.440]   This is a phone for non-smartphone users, feature phone users who want a smartphone.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.680]   And I think they'll less intimidated by this.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.880]   And it's a little easier to use.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.400]   And I think Microsoft's smart because 80% of all phone users are still using feature
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   phones.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.040]   It's the best smartphone they've ever made.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040]   Well, sure.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040]   I would agree with that.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.120]   I had lunch with Wilson Rothman formerly of Gizmodo now with MSNBC.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.880]   A couple days before the device came out, he had an early review unit.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.280]   And I liked it.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.800]   I was all primed to hate it, but it felt like all of the nice things about the physical
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800]   UI of the Zoom.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.360]   Seriously, don't laugh at me because it's not--
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.360]   No, how would you agree?
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.600]   --what have nice physical UI.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.760]   But they really got the software right.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.680]   They really got the flow of usability right.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.200]   Or writer than they've ever had it before.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.680]   It's a very non-Microsoft product.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.680]   It's a remarkable--
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.680]   --it's still Microsofty.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   Yes.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.560]   If it was something else, I would have been like, oh, this is the greatest thing to
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.560]   worry about.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.560]   When is Microsofty, you already take it with a grain of salt.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.560]   And you're like, OK.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560]   Then you touch it.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560]   And I'm like, wow, this is nice.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.560]   And in fact, I don't even think of that as a Microsoft phone, so much as a Zoom phone.
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   I mean, this is an extension of what they were trying to do when they started the Zoom
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560]   campaign.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.560]   Now, to be fair, Microsoft had the advantage of watching Android and Apple and waiting.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   And Apple had waiting.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.080]   And they had three years to look at what everybody's doing.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.640]   So they benefited from that.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640]   But they did some things differently.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.000]   They still could have messed it up.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   No, boy, we know that.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.280]   I mean, to me, this is what WebOS should have been, what the Palm Pre should have been.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.800]   If they'd given the Palm Pre this much performance, it would have been a much more successful
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   phone.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   And everything-- you had a lot of pitches on there.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   Everything was loading, like, extremely fast.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   Yeah, it's very snappy.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   The way I thought it should be like.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.600]   But, Jenny, you wouldn't buy one, I bet you.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   I might.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600]   Buy me one too.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.600]   You would trade in your iPhone for Christmas.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600]   Amazon.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.400]   And I'm just guessing you're an iPhone user.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:41.000]   I'm an iPhone user, but I'm thinking about having a few and using them regularly in
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.920]   ways that I haven't during review periods.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:50.080]   Because I'm interested to see if part of my evaluation of different mobile devices has
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.920]   to do with just the learned familiarity that we get when we sort of fall into familiarity
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   with one brand.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.920]   I'm with you 100%.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   This is why I buy.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.680]   I mean, I'm trying to be objective.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.200]   I love my iPhone.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   Anytime.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.840]   I'd like to make sure that I'm doing due diligence on maintaining an open mind.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.080]   This is why I buy phones and I use them because two weeks is not enough.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080]   A week is not enough.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.160]   You've got to use it for a few months and you've got to bite the bullet and use it.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.880]   You hated the keyboard on the iPhone to begin with.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.760]   I can't review things just by looking at the box.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   You know, I'm just not--
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.040]   By the way, yes, John said he was going to explain that to us.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.120]   How do you review things by looking at the box?
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.960]   You can look at the box a lot of times.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:33.320]   And the way that works is that it is a moment of gestalt.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.120]   In the olden days when there was actually a lot of software flowing around, I had to
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   look at a lot of it.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.920]   You didn't have time to boot a lot and you have to make a decision on whether you want
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   to review this.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.120]   And you could tell by the box many times whether it was a piece of crap because the
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   box just looked like a piece of crap.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   There was misspellings on it.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.760]   The listing of what it did, it didn't obviously do anything.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   It was poorly designed.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.240]   It had bad vibes on the box.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.240]   Let's test this.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.800]   John, I'm going to show you a box.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.440]   And you tell me, you give me your review of this device.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   You ready?
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   Here it is.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.440]   This is the box.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   There it is.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440]   It's square.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.680]   It's got stuff flying out of a screen.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.400]   I have to-- that's a box that is fairly neutral to me.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.120]   It's like somebody was over designed by some art department and it doesn't really tell
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120]   me anything.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120]   There's nothing written on there.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.560]   I would have to open that box up and actually look at the product.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560]   Oh, and give me the thing.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.560]   This minimalism sometimes pays off when it comes to us.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.560]   It does.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.560]   Give me the phone.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   But I am the one.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.560]   I open the box.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.560]   I can take a look at it.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.880]   When I quickly glance through the book, it might be, you know, I may or may not like
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   the product.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880]   Here's what's inside.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   Wow, how'd you get it out of there?
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.880]   It's amazing.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.880]   You know, it's cell phone companies, by the way.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880]   It's a giant phone.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.320]   The boxes are very primitive.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.160]   This is the Samsung Galaxy Tab.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.680]   And actually, you know what?
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.680]   Oh, somebody's been playing angry birds on it.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.680]   Not me.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.680]   What's it mean?
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.000]   It was told by a number of people, oh, it's terrible.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.560]   The applications don't scale properly because it's a seven inch display.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560]   It's running Android.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560]   You know what?
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560]   They scale beautifully.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.200]   And this is actually extremely usable.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.080]   You have a black banana and a pretty darn good device.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.000]   I think this is a good competitor to the iPhone.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.880]   Jennie, have you played with any of the Android tablets yet?
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.480]   This is the dumbest game I've ever seen.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.640]   Oh, John, I begged to differ.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.880]   This is fruit ninja I'm playing for those of you listening.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.520]   Oh, so that's a vegan game.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.520]   It's vegan.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.240]   No fruit will die.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240]   It will be harmed.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.240]   Actually, all of the fruit will be.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.040]   So you're making smoothies with all of that?
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.040]   Yes, of course.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040]   It's delicious.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040]   And they have fruit facts in between.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:42.520]   Now, this is a non-vegan game because you're killing pigs, angry birds.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.360]   So I have to say, this is actually quite impressive to me.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:51.760]   I think that this shows that Android, even though Google has said 2.2 is not really a
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.840]   tablet OS.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.360]   This is running 2.2, not gingerbread, 2.3.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.240]   I have to say, I've been very impressed by this.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   Now, did you start with very low expectations?
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   Yes.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.040]   I'd read reviews of this that said, oh, it's a terrible device.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.440]   Oh, come on.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.840]   He's going to smile at you.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.840]   Oh, you got him.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.440]   OK, got him.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.440]   By the way, I just want you to know that was an amazing shot.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440]   I know that was professional shot.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   I've played that for the moment.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.440]   I've played that for the moment.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:21.280]   I would like to pause for a moment and say, that was completely serendipitous.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.280]   I had a new high score.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   Congratulations.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.040]   You're like a pro-plan, yeah.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.040]   Maybe I've played a little too much of Angry Birds.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.640]   But this shows me that there's going to be some competition for Apple in this tablet
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.640]   space.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.440]   I don't think a Windows tablet will do it, but Android actually does pretty nicely.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.760]   That's what is exciting.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.360]   It's like the biggest step is from--
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.360]   It's a fact.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.360]   It wants to--
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.640]   And this is true of anything when you're opening a new market.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.760]   The biggest step is from zero successful devices to one successful device.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:50.200]   And the second biggest step is from one to two.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.200]   And from here is where it explodes.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.560]   And you get all kinds of different devices that cater to--
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.200]   We saw that with the iPhone, didn't we?
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.200]   Exactly.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.480]   And so just as the iPad-- I mean, I'll admit, I was very skeptical of the iPad as a device
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.520]   that people would keep on them and use.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.000]   And obviously it was a big, big hit.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.440]   And I own an iPad now, but I suspect looking at this device that this will be better because
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.720]   I do take this ridiculously big laptop with me.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.480]   If I'm going to take a small-- I don't want to take a full iPad and this giant laptop,
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.880]   but something like the Galaxy would be fantastic.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.680]   Oh, you know, the thing you want to take-- let me just give you some advice.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.120]   It's the MacBook Air.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.520]   That device is the winner.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520]   I have to say--
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.520]   It's pretty sweet.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.520]   The new one's pretty sweet.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.520]   It's really sweet.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.520]   In fact, Consumer Reports--
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.520]   I'm taking that home at my name.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.520]   --which is no Apple fan.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:39.520]   They still are telling people not to buy an iPhone 4 because of the antenna issues.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.960]   Said this is the best laptop they've ever tasted.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.600]   This is better than anything they've ever tested.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   Looking at this MacBook Air--
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.600]   They tasted it.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   They looked it.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   They looked it.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.600]   Isn't that what Steve Jobs said?
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.600]   It's a despicable interface.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.960]   I think he said that about the iPhone.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:55.240]   A friend of mine, the fantastic magician and consultant Andrew Maine--
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   That disappears up your sleeve.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.240]   You're in deep trouble.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.440]   Well, he did a whole hour-long talk.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.840]   He did a whole hour-long talk talking about the principles that are used in magic and
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.280]   illusion and how Apple is a wizard of co-opting him.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.000]   Because if you look, this is a deceptive base.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   So when you look at it head-on--
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.240]   It looks thinner than it is.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.640]   --you only see this edge on both sides.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.920]   Now, meanwhile, obviously, it gets thicker at the back.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.560]   And if you look at it this, it looks more like a regular laptop that you're going to
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.560]   be accustomed to.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.560]   No.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560]   What do you mean?
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.560]   No.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.560]   Get out of there.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.560]   It's half the laptop that I'm regularly accustomed to.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   Okay.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560]   Well, I think it looks just like this one.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.560]   I don't see what the difference is at all.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.560]   Holy crap.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.560]   He's acting the same.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.560]   This is an O and laptop.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560]   This is a news.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.560]   This is a Brian laptop.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.920]   I've got to tell you that Brian Brushwood has the largest laptop I have ever seen in my
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   life.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   Yes, I've got more to love.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.920]   That's what I've been telling people for years.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.680]   That's my line.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680]   Wow.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:48.520]   So, Jenny, what do you think of these Android tablets?
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.520]   How many of you play with the Arcos?
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.640]   I mean, just briefly, I haven't taken one home for a longer kind of test drive.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:04.520]   You know, again, I'm not a big fan of that really brief embargo review period, that
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520]   we all have to go through.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.520]   I don't do it.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.520]   I refuse.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.520]   You don't have to go through it.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.520]   I refuse.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.520]   You don't have to, but you do have that option if you want to get the early review.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.320]   And you'll be called upon on day of release by networks and CNN and I'm ready to review
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.320]   it.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.280]   So, I understand why it would be in your interest to get it a week or two early.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.280]   I wish you...
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.360]   You don't have to do any of this, but that's the game as it exists.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.120]   And I don't like that.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   I feel like the...
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120]   I don't blame it.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120]   I don't blame it.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.120]   Yes, it's corrupt.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.800]   Well, it's corrupt because people like Mossberg and David Pogue have seemed to have a monopoly
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   on this.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.840]   Jenny, you've gotten pretty good, I think, at getting on this list.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840]   Have you not?
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.280]   I didn't do anything.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.280]   I just...
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:54.240]   But no, I know you didn't because I have absolute integrity, but don't you see how it implies?
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.240]   Look at some stress.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.240]   It says...
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.160]   It implies some sort of relationship and you have to...
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.160]   You end up being defensive about it.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.400]   Well, it's super-defensive because you don't want to screw it up at the same time.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.960]   No, that's why you don't want to do it.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:13.840]   I am very proud to cheese off Apple whenever possible because I don't want to be...
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.160]   Perception is important in this as well and I don't want to be perceived as...
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.560]   And I have been in the past, perceived as an Apple fanboy.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.560]   Can I interrupt?
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.040]   Yes, John C. de Vorek.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.240]   Isn't it also...
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.520]   Haven't you actually, because of your high road that you've taken, Leo?
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.040]   You've been banned from Apple events.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.040]   Stop.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.040]   Stop.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.040]   You're just needling me.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.040]   Cut to the photo.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.040]   Cut to the photo.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.040]   No, it's a fact.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.480]   No, in fact, I mean, even in more trouble and I don't want to say why, but I mean, I mean,
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.960]   actually even in more trouble.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.800]   Let's just say someone won't be showing up on the person of the year list anymore.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.960]   Hey, let's talk about that.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.160]   Tom Magazine, person of the year.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.440]   Now, see, they did this before.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.640]   They put it online for votes, but they obviously have no intention of paying any attention
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.640]   to the vote.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   In fact, number one right now, would you read that name, Brian Bruschett, because I tried
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.800]   to and I couldn't.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.800]   You know what?
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.280]   I could not and sadly, I didn't even recognize him on the face of the...
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.280]   Apparently, the Prime Minister of Turkey.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.280]   Yes, but I guess...
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.280]   Oh, let me find the actual artist.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.280]   You know who he is, Jenny?
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.280]   No.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.280]   This funny little is not looking at her face at all.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.760]   He's like, "You know, I love that guy."
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.880]   Chitulu, he is mine.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.360]   I find that whole thing weird that they would choose him because he's actually the kind of
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.800]   the leverage against the original Atta Turk.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.840]   Is he a Muslim?
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840]   Now, remember...
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.040]   Yeah, he's a Muslim fundamentalist.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.040]   He's a fundamentalist.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.600]   When it comes down to it.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:44.680]   But to remember that Time Magazine, Person of the Year, is not in fact a good person necessarily.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.680]   Hitler's been chosen.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.680]   It's merely the most important person of the year.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:53.200]   Now, what was interesting is Marissa Meyer on a panel said it should be...
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.800]   You'd think she'd say Eric Schmidt, Larry Page, she said Steve Jobs.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.880]   She said he's made a big difference.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880]   It should be...
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.800]   You know the story was told that he was picked as Person of the Year.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.720]   It went in 1982 or whenever.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.880]   When they made the computer, the man of the year, the person of the year, Steve Jobs was
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:18.320]   original choice and he turned out to be such a kind of apparently a jerk to the kind of
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.120]   scene people that they pulled it.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.440]   You've heard the story from Steve from Mosdia.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:26.440]   So they have an online voting system at time.com right now.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:30.960]   And Steve Jobs is currently number seven with 10,000 votes.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.000]   It's one-tenth of the current number one, which I'm going to make a big bid for this one.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.320]   Rissa Tae-yep, Erdogan.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.320]   That's why I made you say that.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.320]   That's right.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.320]   I know.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.320]   I don't know.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.320]   Erdogan.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.320]   Where's Leo?
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.320]   I'm not on the list.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.320]   Lady Gaga is number two.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320]   Lady Gaga number two.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320]   This is why Internet...
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   That tells you everything you need to know.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320]   No.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.320]   Internet polls don't...
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.360]   You know, Julian Assange, I think you can make a good case for this guy.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.160]   He's the creator of WikiLeaks being certainly the most...
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.160]   One of the most important people in the year.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.920]   I would say he certainly is the person who in that same spirit of, you know, for
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.840]   good or for ill, for, you know, kind of like, you know, Hitler making a list of my saying
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.840]   you say, but the point is, is like, somebody...
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.240]   So, Julian Assange is Hitler?
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.560]   No, come on, stop that.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.800]   But for somebody who affected the headlines of the year, I would say this is my big Julian
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.800]   son.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   Big, yeah.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.680]   Glenn Beck, John Stewart and Stephen Colbert.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.480]   They're neck and neck and votes.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.360]   Then in number six position Barack Obama, then in number seven position Steve Jobs, number
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.960]   eight, the unemployed American.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.120]   Boy, do you really want that one on the history list?
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.180]   I want the unemployed American.
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.660]   I want the unemployed American.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:33.660]   I want the unemployed American.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:36.680]   I just want the photo to be a guy on his couch.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.680]   I want it to be on the street.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.680]   If we can account...
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:39.680]   Like it should be Odakta.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.680]   Yes.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.680]   The unemployed American.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.480]   Are you going to start campaigning for the unemployed American?
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.900]   I'm going to not work for like, the next month and a half.
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.960]   And then after that is just like, you know, the Chilean miners.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.520]   I think the Chilean miners are good.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.520]   They didn't do anything.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.760]   They were stuck in a hole.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.300]   I mean, can you name any other names?
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.300]   I think they did job poorly actually.
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   They did.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.200]   They caused the Cape to collapse.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   They got...
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.040]   But they did all right.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.900]   They lived to tell on the tale.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:07.100]   They were on the Letterman Show.
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:10.720]   I think you could make a strong case for Mark Zuckerberg, who is in the top 20.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.720]   You know what?
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.720]   I did like that.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720]   I got one.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.920]   It's not on the list for someone.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.760]   Tim Linsichem.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.760]   Who is that?
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.800]   He's the Giants baseball pitcher who features Texas Rangers.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:21.800]   Who's that?
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.800]   Who's that?
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.800]   Who's that?
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.800]   Who's that?
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.800]   Who's that?
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.800]   Who's that?
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:27.800]   I said that.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800]   Wow.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.960]   Leo, cut his mic.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   Do it.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.800]   Look, look, you are not in the studio.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.080]   I will say anything I want to you right now, Mr. de Vorac.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.080]   Are you a...
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   At least fan?
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.480]   No, no, you must be a Yankees fan.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.640]   No, he's obviously doesn't know anything about baseball.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.880]   I was really fit.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.880]   Look.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880]   Actually, look.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.680]   It was the greatest World Series ever.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   At least I started team weeks.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.680]   I started team weeks.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   I started team weeks.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.480]   He was so close to a sweet John.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.600]   Linsichem was dominant, but God, you got to love Brian Wilson, not the Beach Boy, the
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.240]   guy with the beard.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.240]   And the Mohawk.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.240]   And the Mohawk.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240]   Yeah, I didn't know there was a Mohawk under there until...
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.600]   But what's this weird thing that Pat Morel does?
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.760]   He dresses up in weird leather.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.560]   No, what's the...
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:11.240]   Is it Burrell that does that?
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.960]   He wears a thong because apparently he was on a...
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.960]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.960]   that's different.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.960]   The thong...
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   So airport security thing.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.520]   Well, the thong guy is on first base.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.520]   What's his name, uh...
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520]   The glitter thong guy.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520]   I mean...
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520]   Yeah, glitter thong.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.240]   We're not talking about Lady Gaga anymore.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.360]   I don't know what Burrell does.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:38.320]   Burrell, but when Brian Wilson was on with Leno, Burrell comes...
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:44.240]   Like sneaks out by on the set with a full SNM leather half-naked, more than half.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.840]   It's a San Francisco Giants.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.840]   What just happened?
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:47.840]   I thought this was a tech show.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.840]   You know what?
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:49.840]   We were classy up until this moment.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.160]   If you would know who Linsicom was, we'd be on our way.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.160]   Actually, that was...
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160]   I'm not gonna lie.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.160]   I'm gonna own up to this.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.160]   But I don't follow sports.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.160]   So Mark Zuckerberg took the blood for him.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.160]   I think Mark Zuckerberg would be...
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.160]   Don't you think he's made a signet?
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.160]   I agree.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160]   I've certainly certainly...
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160]   I heard he's got a movie out.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.120]   Certainly he is the tech person of the year.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.120]   I would give him that instantly, but I think I would give him two.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.520]   More than sea jobs?
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.720]   More than not more...
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.720]   Yes.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720]   Yes, I would say more than...
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   How many people are on Facebook again?
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   Five hundred and half billion.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.720]   Did he have a movie?
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.720]   Well, the movie.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.720]   He's sorry.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.720]   The movie.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:22.720]   The movie.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.720]   Don't do the movie.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.720]   I'm just numb to the sound of that.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.720]   I think Mark...
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.720]   I think he's the only person of the year.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   I don't know.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.200]   I don't even know how important those lists are.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.200]   See, I'm with nothing.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.200]   It kind of fucks me out that the only female name that you mentioned there, I think, probably
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.760]   the only one on the list.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.600]   Sarah Palin and Lee Nancy Pelosi is on there.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.720]   Why can't we have one woman who...
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:50.120]   Where's pants to the office and does something interesting with science and technology?
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.120]   Hillary Clinton.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.120]   You get recognized.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:58.040]   I read a blog post which I thought was really right on about Wired magazine.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.960]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.280]   There was some interesting stuff that came out of the chart.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.720]   I hadn't really thought about that, but once...
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:10.760]   I'm going to try to see if I could find it, but basically her point was that Wired covers
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.760]   our misogynistic.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760]   Well, okay.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   That doubt, okay.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:20.440]   The point I think she was making was that the magazine hasn't had a woman on the cover
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.760]   just for straight up science and technology achievements since, I don't know, 1996 with
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.680]   Sherry Turkle, I think that was it.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.680]   Right.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.800]   There's been Martha Stewart and Sarah Silverman and some sexy covers with...
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.720]   Well, and the current cover which is...
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.680]   Which is new.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.320]   The story is about tissue engineering.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.280]   There's nothing to do with boobs, but the cover is cleavage.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.680]   Well, I mean, it sells...
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.680]   Look, it sells magazines.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680]   Nice or solid.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.960]   I just thought they must be really desperate to flog the print sales.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.720]   That's not being doing well.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:51.720]   And I think it's...
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:55.560]   You know, it's definitely fair to have this discussion, but it's unfair to single Wired
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:02.040]   out is the only publication that suffers from a lack of smart females on the cover.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.040]   What?
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.960]   Give me a couple of women that should be women of the year.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.720]   Just so I can get educated on some...
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.080]   Look, I mean, it's not my job to like pick up.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.080]   Oh, I know.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.080]   I know.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   It's not a job.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.480]   I was just asking in general, like, you know, because Sarah Palin obviously is a joke.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.920]   Well, I think her point is, is Time's job is to let us discover people who we can...
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.600]   We didn't even know should be the person of the year.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.600]   Yes.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.600]   And it would be nicer for more of them more women.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.200]   Because half the people on the list, most people don't know.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.200]   Correct.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200]   So I got you...
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.200]   I don't...
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.360]   I think if they're legitimately the person of the year, it's not going to be somebody
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   you never heard of.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.280]   Well, let's say, for example, let's say there was an issue.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.720]   And for example, I didn't recognize...
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.280]   I forgot that Julian Assange was the guy who did WikiLeaks.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.360]   I've heard WikiLeaks all year long for multiple giant stories.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.360]   Here's the blog post.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.120]   Cindy Royal, Cindy's take on tech.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.120]   There's the Wired cover, the current Wired cover.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.440]   I thought this was such a great post.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.160]   "Dear Wired, I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with you.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.160]   I love you.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.920]   You're charming, attractive, and smart, everything I would ever want in a magazine.
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.640]   Most of the time you're harmless and I tell everyone I know how awesome you are.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.120]   But every now and then you slip and you make me feel very bad."
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.120]   And then she...
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.000]   You know, she's done a good job of putting together Wired covers.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.040]   There's the Sherry Turkle cover.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.880]   Here's Laurie Anderson.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.840]   But those were more than a decade ago.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.200]   Well, no, no, pan down.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.800]   That's not a sexualized cover with Sarah Silverman on there.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   I mean, if it's a...
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.800]   And that's not a sexualized cover.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.840]   But the point is that Sarah Silverman isn't running a technology company.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.000]   She's a comedian, she's an actress.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.040]   They've had actresses and models and people like that on.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.440]   What about Katarina Fake?
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.040]   Why shouldn't she be on the cover?
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.520]   I don't understand why she'd...
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.320]   I mean, there are a lot of examples and actually Cindy in her blog post refers to quite a few
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.320]   of them.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.760]   I think this is a legitimate question to pose.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.360]   Now, admittedly, Condi Nast is the publisher.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:52.520]   I mean, this is exactly the kind of stuff Condi Nast, I'm sure does on...
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.720]   Don't they publish Cosmopolitan as well?
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720]   I mean, there's a lot of...
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720]   Oh, is that sexy publication?
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.720]   Hersto's Cosmopolitan.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:02.000]   Well, they publish similar kinds of magazines, I'm sure.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.120]   Well, it's part of why I love what we do on Boing Boing, because we don't have to worry
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:13.040]   about pushing a certain number of copies of a dead tree issue with every story that we
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.040]   write.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:18.400]   And I think that that's to cover people and things and ideas that maybe aren't on the
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.400]   top of the heap yet.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.400]   We're able to pursue things that fascinate us.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.840]   And I think that that...
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:31.080]   It's not diversity by design, but it does end up yielding more of a diversity of participants
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080]   in that conversation.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.960]   Well, if we could swap roles, and I could play devil's advocate here, and I'm very sympathetic
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:40.920]   to the point, I would be interested to know, I guess to know whether or not there's an
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.320]   unfair bias.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:47.480]   We would have to know, because it's very specific, it's clear you want women in technology or
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:52.480]   in science to be on the cover, but I would imagine, out of all the topics they cover on
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.960]   Wired, that that is a much smaller...
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.120]   Well, she makes the point that when Wired did a major story about Katarina Fak, who found
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.200]   it flicker, she wasn't on the cover.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.640]   Will Ferrell was on the cover.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.640]   And that sells magazines.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:10.240]   Now, Jenny, you're actually, I think, being a little self-deprecating, because this is
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:16.240]   the dead tree issue, but plenty of blogs do exactly the same thing to generate traffic.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:21.600]   And it's to Boeing's credit that you haven't succumbed to that kind of link bait.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.960]   It's the same thing when people sell the time, "Oh, there's no black people in the space."
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.960]   Well, when African Americans, or whatever, make awesome products, and the cream rises
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:29.960]   to the top, they'll be on the top.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:30.960]   But here's the deal.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   Wired is arguably one of the journals of record of the tech industry.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.920]   It's all the other paper magazines have fallen by the wayside.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.360]   If you're going to encourage more women to get involved in tech, you're going to put...
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.440]   You're going to exalt them at least once in a while, so that there is some sense that
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:54.640]   there's a position, there's a role for women in tech, that it's not just Sarah Silverman,
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.920]   Martha Stewart, and Pam from The Office that count.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:02.800]   You guys can talk to your Blue in the Face about this.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.000]   In big magazines, especially groups like Connie Nes, they study this to death.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.800]   They roll out one of these issues with somebody you want.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:14.560]   They cover drops dead on the newsstands, and the guy who's doing the covers gets chewed
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.920]   out, and so he goes with what sells.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:17.920]   That's what it boils down to.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.920]   You can't complain about it.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:23.320]   That's why I don't have the argument when people tell me, "Oh, there's no blah, blah,
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.320]   blah."
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.160]   People are like, "Okay, well, if you want any more people of color, there will be a couple
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160]   of people of color."
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160]   We don't find those if we want.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.600]   We bought the magazines with Sherry Turkle on the cover.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600]   Exactly.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600]   We make the complaint.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.080]   We date a point on the cover, but it's not what we want.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.120]   Apparently, and when we want it, we'll get it.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.440]   It's the same people complaining about how crappy TV is.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.440]   Right?
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.360]   It's crappy because people watch it.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.360]   Stop complaining.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:03.360]   That's what we want to do.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.960]   I absolutely love Jenny's post about damn you autocorrect.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.760]   That is the greatest website on the Facebook planet.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:09.760]   It's so funny.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.200]   I meant to read this on the radio show because everybody identifies with this.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.400]   Tell us about this, Jenny.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:23.040]   So there's a blog where somebody's been capturing screen grabs of really embarrassing or funny
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:28.040]   autocorrects that happen on different smartphones where people are texting back and forth to
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.200]   each other.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.240]   The one that I think grabbed for Boing Boing was somebody said, "I reached a really, really
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.000]   high level of anal birds."
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   Oh my god.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   Oh my god.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   Oh my god.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000]   Oh my god.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   Oh my god.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   We got a spit take on the galaxy.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   Oh my god.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   We got a spit take on the galaxy.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000]   And I missed it.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   Damn.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   That's why we needed actual director.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   That's why I saw the site.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   The first time I saw the site I think I went through that.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   A spit take?
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   A spit take.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000]   That's what I tend to want to do.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   The screen grabs it right.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.840]   It's really, really, really great.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.760]   Aren't they all the iPhone?
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   Let's face it.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.760]   This is the iPhone.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.760]   I love them.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:04.760]   Oh my god.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.760]   Yeah, it's all Newton technology, apparently.
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.600]   Here's somebody I guess I lied earlier.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:12.600]   I feel pretty good right now.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.080]   Is that because you took something not yet?
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:19.840]   I ate something and did some humping jacks.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.840]   Bible study on the 19th.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.760]   I could probably do the 11th since I have this Friday off.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.840]   I'll need all my spare ribs for school next week.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.320]   I'm traveling.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.640]   So we made a game out of this on NSFW last year.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:35.000]   Yeah, what we did is we gave you the conversation without telling you what the real word was.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.720]   So you had to read the conversation and based on what people said, you had to figure out
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:40.720]   what the actual word was.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.520]   In fact, I just posted it in the document under right next to Zenny's post there.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.760]   I assume this was my post.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.760]   I don't know.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.120]   But basically, we would read it out and then you had to guess like, you know.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.120]   What they meant?
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.120]   Exactly.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.120]   All right, here's one.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.120]   Here's one.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   Sweet Jesus.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.120]   This is from Missy.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:01.320]   That guy I slept with at NYU is here where Alexa and I are hook up with him.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.320]   Hangman, Mo.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.520]   I mean, it was his hand man.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.720]   Mo.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.720]   She meant to type ha ha ha ha.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:11.720]   No.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:12.720]   Oh, OK.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720]   But she typed hangman.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.720]   Mo.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.360]   This is a great sight.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.560]   My favorite was like, you know, oh, baby, when are you going to be over?
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.520]   And the answer was Zionism.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:25.920]   I can't even hold the scroll bars, Teddy.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.520]   Yeah, you guys have to come.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:31.120]   Oh, my God.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:31.920]   OK.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:36.320]   This is very funny.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.720]   Good find, Jenny.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.120]   Damn you auto correct.com.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.320]   And I just I screwed up all of your equipment.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.320]   That's OK.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   You're not only water.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.320]   You might as well.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.120]   You know, he's the Macbook air now.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.120]   Oh, true.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.120]   It's got my saliva on him.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.120]   You spit on it.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.120]   It's yours, right?
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.120]   Isn't that the role?
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.320]   You know, you can spit on the galaxy tab all you want.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.920]   You keep your you keep your saliva off my.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   I'll take the tablet.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.920]   I'm my air.
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:27:59.920]   Thank you.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:00.920]   Oh, my God.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:01.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.720]   I'm so it's not my fault.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.920]   So let's look at those consumer review ratings because they're kind of interesting.
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.320]   Android phones big time across the board from Consumer Reports.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:18.120]   They do they give you a sign a a numeric score as anybody reads Consumer Reports knows
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:19.120]   to the phone.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.120]   The number one phone according to their numeric score.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.120]   I don't know.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:27.120]   I think people consider Consumer Reports a valid reviewer of tech objects.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]   I know.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]   I do.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.880]   I in general on balance, I have high faith in consumer reports and especially because
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.120]   I believe in them for cars.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120]   They're very independent.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.520]   Yeah, I don't.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:45.720]   Of course, PC magazine and his heyday from about I'd say 89 to 90 to 2000.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.240]   Let's say date when we had this huge lab, but we saw the lab, but it used to be huge
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:55.440]   when we used to go over every nook and cranny of every possible aspect of these computers
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.720]   that came in and we compared them to with the Consumer Reports version of these reviews
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.520]   and they were shallow.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:04.120]   They were missing the point and they were largely wrong.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.520]   I've never been a big believer in Consumer Reports after that.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:12.000]   I used to choose shampoo based on consumer reports until my wife told me those guys
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.600]   wash their hair with soap.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.120]   You can't listen to them, but let's give it.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.120]   Let's give you the ratings.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:24.280]   The number one phone according to Consumer Reports, the Samsung Captivate with the 76 tied with
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.280]   the Samsung Vibrant.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.280]   I do like that Galaxy S platform.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:34.280]   Then the Droid X just below it with 75 points and the Droid 2, the EVO with 74 points, the
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:40.320]   3GS, not the 4, the 3GS with 74 points and that's because they don't recommend the 4
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.680]   still due to the antenna issues.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:48.480]   The ARIA with 74 points, the Droid incredible with 73, the Ally with 72.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.480]   These are all Android phones.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:54.320]   I think we're getting to the point where it's especially with technology.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.040]   There's so many different aspects to it.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:30:01.720]   It's easy for Consumer Reports or for any review institution to look at numbers and say,
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.240]   "Well, this is two cameras," and that's clearly better than one camera.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.240]   It's how the device fits with you and if you're the type of person, it's how you feel
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.080]   about your phone, it's what you're into.
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.520]   I am really surprised that the Galaxy took the top spot.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:17.800]   That makes me, I got to admit, I'm a little bit Android curious these days.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   I want to try it out.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.440]   I got this when we complete with them.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.880]   Oh, stop it.
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:23.880]   I spit on it.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   You know, I just have to say, I'm very glad that there's so many good choices now.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.160]   The iPhone dominated for so long.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:32.760]   I waited six hours in line to get the first iPhone and I love the iPhone, but I'm really
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:37.560]   glad that the Android phones and frankly the Windows phone, these guys have caught up and
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.280]   there's some great choices out there.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.280]   It's good to see where wins.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.520]   Yeah, when they have competition, they'll push each other, so that's always a good thing.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:45.720]   We've lost your pictures, Jenny.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.360]   Are you changing the fruit back on?
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.360]   Oh, oh.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.360]   Come back, we love you.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.360]   Don't leave us.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.360]   Sorry, I'm again.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.840]   I thought that you banned me for...
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:56.440]   No, we're going to give John a hug though.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.440]   He needs a hug.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440]   Oh, you're funny.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.440]   Don't worry, you're just going to hug.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.440]   Yeah, you need a hug today.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.240]   I need a perpetual hug.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.600]   Yes, because you are a professional hug machine.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.240]   That should be the name of this...
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.040]   Yeah, John's in the cranky box, but you're in the funny box.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.280]   Look at how happy she is.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.280]   Look at John.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:14.320]   This is my XD face.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:17.880]   It's like nighting day.
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.880]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.080]   We're going to come back with more Jenny Jardin is here from boyboying.net, John C.
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.480]   Devorak from Channel Devorak.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.480]   What is that, John?
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   Is that you?
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.960]   Oh my God, that's John.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.960]   Look at that.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.200]   That's his headshot from a 19.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.000]   He was even crankier when he was young.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.240]   Is that as if that was...
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.240]   That's my...
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.240]   That's what...
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.240]   Do I always went around like that?
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.240]   I totally believed that.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.240]   He looked like a fish that got thrown back.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.240]   He looked so...
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.240]   He just...
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.240]   He still got the hook in there.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.240]   You didn't want me?
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.240]   I'm John C. Devorak.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.320]   That's O and J.J. Stone, O.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.800]   Dr. DeU from O. Dr..com and Brian Brushwood from Schwood.com.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800]   And scam school.
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.800]   Are you out here to do shoot some scams?
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.800]   We just finished.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:56.800]   Three nights.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.800]   Scams, got some good scams.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.800]   Yeah, no, good stuff coming up.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.800]   You want to share anything?
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:03.960]   No, you know why I may talk about it here after the break.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.960]   All right.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.720]   He left us a gallon of white gas.
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:08.720]   Yes.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.160]   So if we ever wanted to do any fire tricks...
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.160]   Burn this mother down.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.120]   That's good.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:17.240]   I was sad when Gil Scott Herron passed.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.240]   Yes.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.880]   Passing of people's always bad.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.640]   Hey, let's talk a little bit about our friends at Ford.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.440]   I was at the Ford plant in Dearborn.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.440]   What a...
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.080]   I just really excited about what Ford is doing.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:32.440]   Bringing back the pride in America's industrial power with some great vehicles including the
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.320]   new 2011 Ford Fiesta you've seen the ads.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.400]   I love it the guy goes.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.400]   That's kind of a big thing.
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.400]   I love that.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.400]   I love that.
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:42.880]   The EPA estimated 40 highway miles per gallon.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.360]   Now I got to tell you, you look at the hybrids.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.360]   Look at...
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   I mean, this...
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.360]   Oh, I just realized you're talking about the Fiesta.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.360]   This is the Fiesta.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.360]   This is a gas engine.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.960]   Let me tell you, they get it.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:52.960]   They get it.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.000]   As far as the connected populace online.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   They sure do.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   Who was...
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.560]   I think as Walt Mossberg was getting in one of the Ford's and he said, you know, for a
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.200]   long time driving a car you were going back to the 19th century.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.320]   You know, you're disconnected from everything.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:10.640]   But now with the Ford Sync, you know, an Android phone or the Windows phone or an iPhone, they
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.920]   were smart because they thought these technologies are going to advance faster than we can in
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.920]   the car.
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.160]   So what we'll do is we'll tie the car to your phone.
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:20.920]   We'll use the phone's capabilities and that's where Ford Sync really is exceptional.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.400]   It's got 911 assist through your phone.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:29.280]   You know, if you've got a podcast or music you can call for it by name through the phone.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.080]   Both my Android phone and that Windows phone, the iPhone doesn't do it.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.800]   We'll read you text messages.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:37.640]   The whole idea is you want to keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road but
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.280]   still be connected.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.600]   So a message comes in and goes, "Bing, you got a text message.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.600]   You press the button."
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:48.840]   It goes, "Well, it reads me something like those autocorrect messages."
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:51.120]   And it's usually a cause for great mercy actually.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.600]   I enjoy those text messages.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.520]   But it's like they understand that...
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.960]   And obviously, I mean, I say obviously, but I assume that the VSS targeted especially at
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.800]   younger demographic people who are hyper-connected people who...
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.800]   People who want fuel economy, they don't want to spend a lot of money.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.120]   But you've got to look at the edge if you want a high-tech car.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.120]   That's aimed at the soccer mom and you know...
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:14.440]   But the point is, they want to get around, they don't want to spend a lot of money and
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.120]   they know that those are the type of people who are going to stay connected and those
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:21.080]   are people who are going to be most likely to pick up their phone and check their messages.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.080]   Which is awesome.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.080]   You know, it's cool.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.000]   As I have my Droid X is my phone, so that's tied to the Bluetooth.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.680]   But when Henry gets in the car, it gets the audio by a Bluetooth from his phone.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.200]   I can do two phones at the same time.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:32.200]   Wow.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.600]   I can do two music while I make sure that my phone is the one that will ring.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:40.080]   Side note about Ford outside of technology, right now I think they have a special on ABC
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.360]   or NBC.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.960]   But it was just the story of how they didn't take the ballot money, how they struggle through
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.640]   that and they found their way.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.640]   And they're profitable.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:52.120]   And they really went to go through the technology, but also just making a better car and they
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.840]   brought in the right people to have the resurgence.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.840]   It was actually pretty awesome.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:58.680]   Again, because they didn't take that money, that's why I watched it in the first place.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.680]   But it was an awesome story.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.680]   The story is kind of neat.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.680]   And Alan, they're running into this month.
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.680]   They're a good off the watch.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:06.800]   It got so high ratings that they're going to play it a couple more times.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.080]   Their CEO, Alan Malali designed the 777 cockpit.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.080]   Wow.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.320]   He's a Boeing engineer.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.440]   So this guy knows a little bit about technology.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.440]   I mean, he's not.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.640]   He's like pretty.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.920]   We had a great talk with him at CES.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.200]   How we can do that again at CES?
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:24.400]   The one point I'm talking about the Fiesta again, the 1.6 liter DuraTech TI/VC TI4 engine
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.640]   is very peppy.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.000]   There's little things too, like the easy fuel, a capitalist fuel filler.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.880]   You don't need to cap on your-- I have that on my Mustang.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.400]   The four-inch multi-function display with LCD screen, of course, the incredible Ford
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.400]   Sync.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.400]   Take a look.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.600]   Go to your local Ford dealer and drive one this week.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.800]   It is a great car.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.120]   Don't forget the edge as well if you're looking for a little more capacity.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:49.120]   Great cars.
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.440]   I'm very happy in my Mustang.
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.760]   They're doing great ads too.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:53.760]   I haven't seen the ads.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.760]   They're all over the YouTube.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.960]   And our friends over at FilmRide did a very funny one.
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:57.960]   In fact, I loved that one.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:58.960]   I saw that.
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.760]   They eventually released the ad by itself on YouTube.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.840]   And it got like five times the traffic of the episode.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.800]   And I was ticked because I was on that episode.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:09.800]   No.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.800]   In fact, Ford shows that around as an example of how social media can do.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.480]   And new media can be great ads for products.
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:20.160]   Yeah, I'm really-- I'm actually thrilled that they sponsor podcasts.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.160]   They sponsor a lot of podcasts.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:22.160]   Well, they get it.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.160]   That shows a lot.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   I think that shows a lot.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   So we thank them for their support.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.960]   And we encourage you to support them right back.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:33.920]   What do you think about this transit union chief in New York who is suing the Google?
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.000]   Because somebody was slamming him on a blog.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.640]   This is another free speech issue.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   He's going to do anything.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:39.640]   Slam the guy.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.640]   Why are he-- I guess he's suing them so that's--
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:46.200]   He's suing the blogger because the blogger's on blog spot and is anonymous.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.040]   And so he says, "I want Google to reveal this guy's name."
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:54.920]   I mean, it's a-- these are those John Doe lawsuits the music industry does them to.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:55.920]   Yep.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:56.920]   Pretty much.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:04.000]   Should a blogger anonymity be preserved even in a case where the blogger is perhaps defaming
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   somebody?
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000]   Oof.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.920]   Couldn't the blogger just sign up with a fake name and stuff like that?
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:09.920]   He did.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:10.920]   He did.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.520]   So what they need to do is they need a subpoena Google for the IP address.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.520]   That's a lot.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:17.720]   I've actually gone through this with a Twitter.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.200]   And then you get the IP address.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.640]   You know who the ISP is.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.640]   You now--
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:25.240]   This is you tracking somebody down who is doing something?
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.640]   Yeah, we have death threats.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:33.320]   And we then had a-- then we had to go to the jurisdiction where the ISP is another subpoena
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:37.280]   for the ISP saying, "Who used this IP address at this time?"
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.040]   We did in fact get a name and address and--
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:40.040]   Okay.
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.040]   But it's a long process.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.040]   It is a long process.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.040]   There is a subpoena process.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.280]   I presume Google complies with it.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.680]   I think all internet-- what does Boeing might do?
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:49.480]   You must receive occasional--
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.480]   Nasty grants.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.480]   --nasty grants.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.840]   It happens.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.240]   The only comment on this story is that I'm delighted that we're not at the receiving
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.120]   end of the subpoena this time.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.960]   Fair enough.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:07.000]   The guy, the head of the New York City Transit Union, says the blog has repeatedly attacked
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.600]   him with false accusations of incompetence.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.600]   Tongue.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:11.600]   [BLEEP]
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.600]   I think there were twice on this show.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:15.600]   That's two.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.600]   That's two.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.840]   That's the name of the show, the other name of the show.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:19.840]   Not the same thing you were up on.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.840]   The same thing you were up on.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.040]   You just came down to our level instantly.
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.040]   You were all the poor.
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:25.040]   You were all the poor.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.040]   Time for more drinks.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.840]   I'm sorry, I was reading 4chan.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:31.840]   B/B.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:32.840]   Slash B/B.
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.840]   Oh, hell.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.360]   He's going to go after a defamation lawsuit.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:40.560]   But interestingly, Google has declined to comment and has not responded.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.680]   But I think that this is kind of-- there's a standard process for this.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.760]   And having been through this, most companies will not respond.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.640]   They say, you need an official of the court to come to our home.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.280]   And it sounds like a big deal when people sue.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.280]   The way everything's set up, you need to sue in order, for example, for copyright.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.280]   This is going to--
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.280]   That's all it means.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.280]   You're going to court.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.280]   Exactly.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.560]   For copyright, you have to send a letter of cease and desist.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:03.920]   And then you have to sue or else you release your copyright to it, right?
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.280]   Are you playing Tetris?
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.280]   No.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.680]   Because apparently, playing Tetris reduces post-traumatic stress syndrome.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.120]   I totally believe this, by the way.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.120]   Totally right.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:18.320]   Well, because-- well, first of all, I know this much.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.240]   Whether it's Tetris, when I was deep in a chest, I would sit down and go, "I'm going
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.240]   to close my eyes."
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.240]   You can visualize night configurations.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:25.240]   Yes.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.240]   Nightly soothing.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.240]   Yes, exactly.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.240]   And I still have it now.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.240]   I'm playing Drop 7 on the iPhone.
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:30.240]   It's my new addiction.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.240]   Is it like Tetris?
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.720]   It's like Tetris.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:37.880]   And I just picture the numbers dropping and forming.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.600]   It's where your mind goes on an idle cycle.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:46.760]   And I would imagine if I've seen some horrific things that I would prefer my mind go to Tetris
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.200]   or to Drop 7 or to Night Moves, then to those horrific things that I participated or saw.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.200]   I actually--
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.760]   Was that one game Night Boobs?
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:54.760]   Night Boobs.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.760]   Oh, Night Hoos.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.760]   Oh.
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.760]   Basically, you just need something to distract you.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.760]   I don't know so much at Tetris.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.760]   Working on a night boob.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760]   Yes.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.560]   Calm down to our level.
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.560]   We're dirty and filthy.
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.560]   All I want to say is--
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:06.560]   I'm being--
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.560]   She isn't even drinking.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.560]   All I want to say is that Leo--
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.560]   She's drinking vodka.
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:15.000]   Leo squinted and not-- or shook his head when John did it.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.400]   But then he starts grooving when he's like, "I'm playing."
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.400]   He doesn't.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.400]   It's better Leo.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:20.400]   Drink.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.400]   It's about it.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:22.400]   I did read this.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.400]   Just down.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.400]   It bottoms up.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.840]   I don't know much about the research behind it, but having played a few rounds of Tetris
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.440]   in my life, it makes sense.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:33.400]   There's a kind of repetitive geometry.
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.640]   There's this sort of blocky meditative space that you get into.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.640]   You zone out.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640]   You really live it on that game.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   You zone out.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:41.640]   Easy if you think the equivalent of meditation.
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.640]   I do.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.640]   I would totally believe that.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:47.760]   It's a state of low-level self-hypnosis is what I could imagine it as.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.760]   I'm with John on that.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.360]   I don't know about all that.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360]   No, no.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.360]   We've all done that.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.840]   Isn't that why we play video games?
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.840]   It's not-- it's calming.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:58.840]   Even modern warfare too.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.920]   It does take you to even play.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.720]   But meditation is something different.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:05.040]   Meditation is you looking inside of yourself and dealing with the things you have to deal
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:09.400]   with in your own mind and not letting you go mindless into a game and push buttons that
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.400]   distract you.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   No, no, no, no.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.400]   Here's what it is.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.720]   It's like when you are in the world, you have so many different types of stimulation.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:15.720]   You have audio.
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.720]   You have tactile.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.720]   You have visual.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.720]   You have things happening here.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.040]   People talking to you.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:24.680]   And it's like when you do something like Tetris, it occupies some of those inputs.
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:25.680]   So it's like you've--
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.680]   Hey, you've lost Leo.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.680]   He's wandered off at the bottom.
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:30.480]   He's taking the booze out of here because we're getting too real up in this.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.280]   I was actually holding somebody who was a system so he doesn't walk into something.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.280]   That's right.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:37.160]   He's been like, he's walking around like, "Where are you Charles right now?
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160]   He can't see anything."
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.800]   But you've been there.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:42.160]   It's like when you get into a game and it's like, for example, my favorite way--
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.160]   I know what you're saying.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:44.160]   I'm just saying it's different than meditation.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.160]   I understand.
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.560]   That's why you can read audio books while you're driving a car.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.000]   You listen to audio books while you're driving a car because your hands are doing stuff,
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.440]   your eyes are doing stuff, your brain's doing stuff.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.200]   But then you're able to hear and listen.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:58.200]   You have these different inputs and it ties it up when you play a game like Tetris.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200]   Meditating is just me and my--
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.200]   There you go.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.800]   Even a shoot 'em up for me is actually fairly meditated.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.160]   Kind of calming, right?
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.160]   You need to focus.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.760]   Now, I'm a very ADD person.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:08.760]   So I--
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.200]   Are you being sarcastic?
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.520]   When I was a kid and I was undiagnosed ADD, I played chess.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:17.520]   And it was very soothing.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.760]   In fact, they say people with ADD hyper focus.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.060]   And I think that maybe we are in a kind of almost condition, you know, a condition of
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:29.240]   ADD in this society and that these games probably do help people deal with the crazy
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.400]   society that we're at.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:32.400]   I think cooking is a better use of your time.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.400]   Cooking's good too.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.400]   And it's also meditative.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:35.400]   And you get food at the end.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.400]   I've been cooking for a long time and let me tell you.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.400]   See, okay.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.040]   We just have their different flavors in the same game.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.800]   See, talking mama on the week.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.800]   Cooking.
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:43.800]   Not eating.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:44.800]   What?
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.800]   Cooking.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:46.800]   That's surprising.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:47.800]   That's like opening some room.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:48.800]   And now finishing it.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.800]   Exactly.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.800]   Uncle Leo.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.800]   Cooking.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.800]   Not eating.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.280]   Netflix says we're not going to be on Android until they get a much more secure platform.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.880]   We're on iPhone.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:59.960]   They just infect this annoyed Android.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:03.600]   This annoyed Android people know in because they announced it for Windows Phone 7.
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.600]   We've been waiting on Android.
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.600]   They say no.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.600]   It's because it's insecure.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.560]   Do you really think that is Netflix position that they'd like to be in?
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.800]   Or are they being forced in that position by--
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:14.800]   The movie industry?
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.800]   Yes.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.560]   They need a DRM solution.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:18.560]   They say, I don't know.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.080]   How would you steal a Netflix streaming movie?
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.080]   I don't even--
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:22.960]   But I mean, if that was-- I don't know.
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.960]   I mean, capture the raw and damn you like-- I mean, I would imagine you--
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.360]   There's software to do it.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.360]   Really?
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360]   All right.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.040]   Murdoch to pull the plug on MySpace?
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.040]   You think?
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.040]   I don't know.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.040]   I kind of want to make a pool on this one.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.040]   You want to make a death pool for MySpace?
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.880]   He said he was very grumpy.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.880]   He was like John.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.280]   He said this thing's not making money.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.680]   It's not going to let John--
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:44.680]   It was like John.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.680]   It was not going to last.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:46.680]   I'm surprised.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:48.680]   I need to get out of here.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:49.680]   Close the place.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:51.680]   Shut it down.
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:54.200]   Didn't they just redesign it?
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:55.760]   I mean, it's about a new way.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:59.000]   They launched it as a complement to Facebook.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.960]   Kind of waving the white flag.
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:01.960]   Compliment.
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:05.600]   Because Facebook just doesn't have enough animated GIFs of games.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:06.600]   Right.
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:07.720]   You like us?
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.720]   You like Facebook?
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720]   You love us.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:14.000]   But do you know my current position on Facebook is defined entirely by two years ago, John
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.720]   C. Devore exposition on MySpace.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:19.040]   Because Facebook was the young upstart.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.720]   And John C. Devore said, I'm sure I'm going to misquote it, but it was just like, this
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.440]   is a fickle market.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.440]   This is popular.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:29.320]   And what's popular now is very rarely was popular two years from now or three years from
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.320]   now.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.560]   And damned if that's not exactly where we are now.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.120]   That's how I rock.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.680]   That's right.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:36.680]   That's how it goes.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.680]   When I first heard about MySpace, I'm like, what's MySpace?
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:40.400]   I'm like, oh, you're not on MySpace?
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:41.400]   You get on MySpace.
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:42.400]   You're like, oh, MySpace.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:43.400]   You're still on MySpace.
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:44.400]   They laugh at you again.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:45.400]   Ha, you're still on MySpace.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.640]   So I mean, the wave is going to come and go.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:50.880]   That's why when everybody goes crazy about Facebook, I know the numbers.
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.280]   But at some point, what you just said, what John said, excuse me, not what you said,
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.400]   because I'm not giving you credit, what John said, because what happened.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.600]   It happens January 6th of this year.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.560]   You're going to have Paul Chambers trying to get on a plane.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.040]   He's late.
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.120]   He arrives at the airport.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.600]   He tweets.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:14.760]   And by the way, he has a few dozen followers.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:15.760]   He tweets.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:16.760]   Two his friends.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.760]   He says outfrowned.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:18.760]   Two his friends.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.720]   Robin Hood Airport is closed.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.640]   You've got a week and a bit to get it together.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.720]   Otherwise, I'm blowing the airport sky high.
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.240]   Yeah, right.
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:29.800]   This is a great one.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.000]   Tweet might have faded into the obscurity of the internet.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.320]   Had it not been discovered a five days later, not even at the time, but five days later by
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:43.800]   an airport duty manager who forwarded it to his station manager with the note, hey,
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:46.400]   this guy's going to blow the place up five days ago.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:47.680]   No, here's the interesting thing.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:59.480]   Even though the threat was deemed a five days ago, even though the threat was deemed non
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.560]   credible, because I guess five days later, he hadn't done it.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:04.600]   It was passed on to the police.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.520]   January 13th, he was arrested.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.560]   He was questioned.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:10.560]   And he has.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.560]   Pooped, Italy.
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.560]   Who knows?
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:19.920]   Because he is now on Thursday, Judge Jacqueline Davies at Doncaster Crown Court in, which is
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:25.920]   in England somewhere with a name like that, Robin Hood Airport, I think is probably kind
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.560]   of a rural airport.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:33.480]   Ordered him to pay $3,225 in prosecutorial costs.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.480]   For pounds.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.640]   Well, no, it's 2000 US.
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.640]   2000 pounds.
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:41.080]   I converted it for you, John, because I know how you feel about that.
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:45.000]   And a 385 pound fine.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.680]   Stephen Fry among others volunteered to he said, whatever they find you, I'll pay.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.680]   Yes.
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.920]   But my favorite part of this story is now, and if you search on Twitter for the hashtag
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:03.280]   I am Spartacus loved this thousands of people have tweeted the same tweet with a hashtag.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.520]   I am Spartacus.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:10.440]   I've said so many worst things in this on Twitter and you threatened to blow up airports.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.760]   I've threatened to kill people and stab them.
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:14.760]   Yes, I'll kill you right now.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.200]   I will stab you repeatedly.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.880]   He will be getting the streets really.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.440]   Look, I'm your right home.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:26.320]   You used to be my right home when I kill you with the keys and throw jacks on the door.
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.320]   I am out.
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.320]   Now what?
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.320]   Who's going to stop me?
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:33.520]   Now we should explain to the younger set this I am Spartacus comes from a movie, Burk
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.520]   Lancaster movie.
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.520]   Yes.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.520]   Yes.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:37.520]   I didn't know it was directed by Stanley Kubrick.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:38.520]   They said they said Kubrick.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:39.520]   It was a Kubrick movie.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.520]   I didn't know that.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.520]   That is interesting.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:43.800]   There's that famous scene when they say they say we're Spartacus and one guy and one guy
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.720]   who is not Spartacus steps up and says I am Spartacus.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:56.440]   identify the body or the living person of the slave called Spartacus! And now of course, there's Tony
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:03.720]   Curtis, there's Kurt Douglas, or is that Kurt Douglas? Yes, yeah. Kurt Douglas is Spartacus,
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:14.480]   right? Yeah, he's gonna stand up. I'm Spartacus! I'm Spartacus! I'm Spartacus, I'm Spartacus!
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:20.680]   I'm Spartacus! Yeah, when you say a word over and over again, it starts to sound kind of funny.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:26.120]   Really? I have a question right here. So all the slaves say they're Spartacus,
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:31.880]   thereby making his identification impossible. I think we all agree. I think we all agree that
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:37.400]   this was a very silly, silly arrest that they made on this guy. Well, he threatened to blow
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:42.200]   up the airport. Did he? It was deemed a non-credible threat. And after it was deemed a non-credible threat,
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:48.080]   then they went and picked him up. This is a make-word busy-bodiness, right? Who did he threat? Who did he
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:53.480]   threat to? He threaded to his 12 friends on Twitter. That's right. So what? What are they gonna do about
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:57.800]   it? Like a threat? It's not credible. Thank you. Like I said, I just threatened your life. Now if
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.880]   you end up missing, then we have a problem. All right, how do we feel about this whole I am Spartacus thing?
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:05.120]   I think it's kind of cool. It's a move of solidarity. I like it. I like to see that. What do you think?
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.520]   Do you like it? Thumbs up? I'm on board. Yeah, John, are you down for this? You think it's a good idea? Yeah, I'm in.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:17.200]   Come here. Are you down? Fine. She's like, I'm already got the mud with you guys at this point.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:24.720]   It's one thing. It's one thing for- Say again, say again. Oh, DCSS, yes. Like this is a sort of a
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:31.120]   cyclical joke that is repeated in new ways, kind of like what we do with Wildcats, right? Or, you know,
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:42.480]   when when DVD John decrypted the encryption, the CSS encryption on DVDs, and it was made illegal,
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:46.640]   people would wear T-shirts that had the code because you could write it pretty simply, right?
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:54.160]   Right. And everybody remember the code when everybody on dig posted and dig pulled it down at first,
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:50:00.800]   posted the code, the PGP or whatever. Yeah, if you had on T-shirts as well. Yeah. The chat room says
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:06.320]   I am Devorak and that will be our next. I am Devorak. Here's what I want to say is like,
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.800]   it's one thing for us to intellectually think this is a great idea, but do I don't know that I
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:14.720]   I am such a coward. I don't know that have the courage of conventions to type those words. I will
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:20.160]   tweet it out right now without the hashtag I am Spartacus. I will explode. No, no, no, no, no.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:27.360]   Stop. Wait a minute. That's the royal run talking stuff. This is my machine from my IP address.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.960]   That's right. That's right. That's because of this machine when they come back to your five
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:35.760]   joyous. They're like, who typed this? Oh, doctor. Yeah.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:42.080]   Black guys. You hear what I like? All of you are subject to the drunk tweet rule and you should
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:48.560]   not be touching Twitter right now. Oh, man. They're not drunk. Are they drunk? No, who's drunk?
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:54.640]   My glasses. I mean, but it's like seriously like when I think about like me really tweeting those
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:58.880]   words, I was like, I fly a lot. I don't want to get on any list. I don't want to. I honestly don't
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.080]   know that I have the courage to participate in that area. You have it. Look at all these.
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.040]   I am not shell. These are all the I am Spartacus. I am Spartacus. I totally do, but I'm a physical
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:12.160]   coward is what I'm saying. You don't support them. A lot of these I am Spartacus are today and
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:16.320]   recently, I mean, this is, I'll tell you what, I'm looking for I am Devorak's. I guarantee you,
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:19.920]   they're already out there on Twitter. I am Devorak. I'm Devorak.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:27.600]   People, by the way, yes. Oh, I don't know if I'm going to be able to. I got to plug something.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:34.240]   I think that's be I am Devorak, which is my editor at MarketWatch, David Callaway. Need some
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:40.240]   followers on Twitter. Oh, dear. I hate it when people do this. I'll do it next time because I
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:43.920]   got to get his exact name because there's a million guys named David Callaway. I'm not one.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:50.080]   I'm ill prepared to do this show. John, if I may channel you, no one needs followers.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:53.920]   Yeah, John. Actually, John, that's one thing about you that gets me when you get on this whole
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.120]   followy thing and you all grumpy pants. Look, I don't have any followers. You don't see me
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:01.200]   ask for followers on the show. I sit on the show. I have a lovely time. Nobody even knows who I am.
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:06.880]   You don't see them. 3000 times. Oh, yes. They're not cops. Oh, HD, oh, CT,
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:11.520]   hey, spell my my Twitter name because I can't spell. So that's the trick against me. So John
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:15.200]   piped down and stopped promoting other people's Twitter. There is no Twitter. We don't care.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.720]   Let's move on. Next story. I don't even know how you would know when this show was over. I
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:23.440]   it's when the guys are coming in. Yeah, you guys got to finish the bottle. You're not even two
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:29.040]   thirds done. I'll take care of the bottle. Where can we see Mr. Brian Brushwood? Two places,
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:32.800]   two new places. Well, I guess three total. Of course, I'm doing a scam school over at
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:38.480]   revision three, but NSFW every Tuesday night. We come up with goofy games like damn you autocorrect,
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:44.880]   the game where you could try to guess the game while he drinks like crazy and brand new.
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:51.440]   A brand new release just new on iTunes right here on the Twit Network. Me and Thomas Marie, Tom
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:56.400]   Merritt talking about video, whether it's from YouTube up to feature films. We call the show
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:01.520]   frame rate news and commentary and I green-lighted it. Apparently so you were probably drinking from
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:05.440]   that bottle and you just said shut up. Just go. That's awesome. That's frame rate is an awesome
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:09.200]   show. We're having a lot of fun. Yeah. And we're very proud of having it on the Twit Network.
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:12.800]   And Twitter at Shwood where you will not see me saying that I am Spartacus.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:20.320]   Mr. Oh, Dr. JJ Owen JJ Stone. Oh, Dr. O D O H D O C T A H dot com.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:24.000]   It's in a note. It's in the show notes. You can check it out there. There's no show. And by the
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.920]   way, what do you think this is like a professional podcast? I think that you don't handle all that.
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:32.880]   No professionals here handle it. But also I kidnap Brian on Wednesday soon to be for random
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.200]   drinking where we're going to get drunk every Wednesday night and do a show and then I can get
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:41.360]   blind. It'll be in the future. Father. You'll be a good drunk. That's a nice try. I never
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.720]   am a T toad. I'm a T toad. I'm a T toad. I never had a drink. I never had a drink. What is
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:50.320]   only on Wednesday? Wednesday. John C. de Vorak. You could find him at channel de Vorak.com
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.640]   de Vorak.com no agenda show.com. Don't forget checking that out once in a while. We need all
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:00.240]   the support we can get in also on market watch dot com and PC mag dot com. There you go.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:04.880]   Jenny Jardin is at Boing Boing.net and really Jenny. I'm just sorry.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:09.360]   I felt like the lone male guest on the view.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:17.600]   Be in Barbara Walters and hitting the whiskey ahead of time. I don't know what to say. You did
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:21.920]   bring up donkey love. I will say that. It was you and Leo. I think I started it though.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:27.600]   Jenny it was it was that pedo author on Amazon. We adore you. We think you're great and we thank
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:32.960]   you for being here and I talk trash about you on the back channel. By the way. I retweeted it.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:38.640]   I retweeted that tweet. I saw it no more. What? I don't want any more Twitter followers.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:43.440]   Yes. Yes. Yes. She does. You're gonna just see really it. Twitter's more fun when you have fewer
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:47.600]   followers because there are fewer people to heckle you and it's more fun when you're not being
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.640]   happy. I'm not trying to get more followers for myself. I'm being man now and trying to get my
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:59.200]   money. I'm very guilty. Well, Jenny follows me. So I'm very happy. I love her. It was really nice
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:03.920]   meeting you. I do. I do. I do. Oh, no signal. That's not good. Yeah, that's not good. When it
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:09.680]   happens. Windows. Wow. Well, I think I don't know if we're on the air or not, but I think this
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:15.040]   are getting in a picture of this. Our heart. No signal. All right. Look, there's people crawling
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:25.280]   at my feet now to fix this. Oh, we missed. I was all excited. I was going to get some
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:30.160]   blue screen. Get it. We're going to get it. Oh, thank you very much, John, for fixing that. I must
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.480]   have seen. We've designed this studio so cleverly so that in fact, there is something at my foot that
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.440]   can take us off the air. Got it. Just in case I could just kick that by accident. So when you
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:43.040]   start dancing, you're almost guaranteed to go off the air. Can we dance? That was actually
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:47.280]   karmic payback for asking for Twitter followers. There you go. It was. Can we call the show Tech
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:53.680]   Donkeys? No, stop it. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go on. Stop it. Jenny is on Twitter where the
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:58.320]   data flows if you want to follow her, but you mustn't. You know, you have to call me Madame Boyne.
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:02.560]   She did. She did. She did. She did rag on us in her Twitter stream. She's she's all set. I'm checking
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:08.240]   it out right now. She says, I feel like I stumbled into a drunken locker room. I have no business
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:13.280]   being in. It's not safe in here. And then she's speaking in some strange language. I don't even
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:18.960]   it looks like Vietnamese. You speak Vietnamese? Try it phonetically, Leo. Say the words phonetically.
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:24.480]   This is where it's going to end. One ball way. Oh, what? No, that I actually was speaking in
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:34.080]   Vietnamese there. It's a really good suit. Ladies and gentlemen, another tweet is long
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:38.160]   been in the can. Thank you for being here. Actually, you know, I have a few things to plug. I should
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.960]   probably mention that we are going to do a best of for the holiday season. If you would kindly go
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:49.280]   to twit.tv/bestove. You can vote for your favorite bits from the past years. That way,
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:53.840]   we don't have to work the week after Christmas. Also, Kevin Kelly will be joining us on Wednesday
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:57.520]   for our special interview segment. We'll be doing a signature interviews every Wednesday at 4 p.m.
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:03.760]   Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern. That's 2200 UTC at live.twit.tv. Tom Merrin and I talk to Kevin Kelly,
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:09.520]   one of the founders of oddly enough Wired Magazine, who is also a really great writer. He wrote
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:13.600]   that book on the hive mind. He's great. I love Kevin. His new book is wonderful.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:18.880]   Yeah, I've got to get and read it before we talk to him. I've heard him talk about it,
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:24.480]   and I think it's really exciting. What's it called? Do you remember? I don't remember.
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:28.320]   What technology was? That's what technology was. I was trying to think of how to translate that
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:33.680]   into Vietnamese. You speak Vietnamese? No, I just speak the name.
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:34.680]   Just soup.
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.680]   Manuey, I'm so nervous.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:36.680]   Just soup.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:37.680]   Okay.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:41.920]   And tomorrow at 10 a.m. we will be live with our coverage of the Facebook announcement,
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:47.680]   whatever it might be. Tom Merritt and company at live.twit.tv. That's 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern.
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.920]   And I always have to do the math. I think that's 1200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:55.040]   Thank you, Brian Brushburn. Thank you, O'Doctor. Thank you, John Seedivorak.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:58.640]   Thank you, Jenny Chodenden. Thank you all for being here. Enjoy and thank you, everybody.

[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:04.720]   Thanks, Jenny. I'm so sorry.

[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:16.000]   Christ.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:16.880]   Doin' the Twit.
