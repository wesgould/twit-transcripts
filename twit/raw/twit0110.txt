[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   >> Something we should mention here is we're doing this over Skype
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and Skype, of course, has been down for the last couple of days.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   But it still has some flakiness because right now I'm getting a message
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   from Skype.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I thought I'd mention it.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   That says Skype cannot hear you talking.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Click here to select correct, microphone and speaker.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   >> What?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   >> Skype can hear me.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   >> I hear you.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   That's better.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> I don't know if that's related, but that's probably the big story of the week.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It sure put a scare into me.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   In fact, we had to kill a couple of podcasts that we had scheduled for recording
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   because I rely on Skype.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Now, somebody's going to come along and say, "Oh, well, what about Gizmo or other
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   SIP products?"
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I mean, there's plenty of other voice-over Internet products we could have used,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   but we're just so dependent on Skype.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   >> I hate SIP.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Maybe it's just the implementations I've used.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Like Gizmo.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Gizmo is one of the most miserable experiences I've ever had.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's what I was comparing to do.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I was preparing to move everybody to Gizmo.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   >> I think it may just -- I think I may have had an ugly experience with it.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   >> No, I remember the Devorek also.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You had problems.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   >> Well, I hate to say this because Mike Roberts is a friend of mine.

[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   >> Right.

[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   >> Lindo's.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   >> And I was like his main testifying person for his Lindo's case.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   >> Bye.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> Testified.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Anyway, so -- and he got like millions out of the deal.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.400]   So -- but the thing is, I agree with Patrick 100%.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.000]   It works kind of for a while, but it's like it takes -- it's like a virus.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.520]   You can't get it off your system.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.640]   It boots when you don't want it to.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.800]   It's just very painful.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   I just got rid of it.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.760]   I just don't -- I just don't deal with it.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.400]   And I know a lot of people who are really into this stuff to an extreme, and they all
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   say SIP stinks.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.600]   >> Oh, that's too bad.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   SIP is --
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.280]   >> Go to the download web page of a website, and it automatically starts opening the installer
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   for their software.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.120]   >> Oh, yeah, that happened to me.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.120]   SIP is the signaling protocol for voice over the Internet, and it's a standard.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.840]   I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong with SIP.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   There's different implementations.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.640]   Asterisk supports SIP.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.880]   A lot of PBXs supports SIP.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.920]   But the thing is Skype just works so well.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.960]   I mean, and there are people like Alex Lindsey who complain about Skype, but it works better
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.160]   than anything else out there.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.200]   >> Yeah, what are they complaining about?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.440]   What's all that -- we haven't heard a lot of weird noise, by the way.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   >> Patrick's like -- I think Patrick's making license plates.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.840]   Is that your new job?
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   >> No.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.600]   I was opening up a -- I was opening up a gizmo window on a PC to see them in the same thing.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.760]   >> Move the keyboard away from your microphone.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.160]   >> That sounds like license plate stamping.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   I don't know.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   >> Like microphone 1A.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   So --
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.880]   >> Oh, John -- now that John's got the big setup.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   >> He's like the --
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   >> I got a rig.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   He's got a rig.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   >> Yeah, he's got -- he's got his own compressor.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   Do they send you --
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   >> I have a bypass for you.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   >> Did they send you an AFEX?
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   What do they send you?
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   No, you can use it.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   >> I have an AFEX.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   I haven't hooked that up yet.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   I'm using some PreSonas stuff.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   >> AFEX is going to send me a 230.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   I'm going to try it.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   It might sound -- it might be great.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.560]   >> Well, you know, I -- what are you doing, Patrick?
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.560]   It sounds like you got --
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   >> You're chopping up a body.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.560]   >> You have ferrets in there.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.560]   What's going on?
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   >> No one ever throws it.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.360]   >> Guys, guys, I had my microphone turned off and on mute.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.800]   That's not me making the noise.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.960]   Might be my network connection.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.480]   Might be Skype, but it's not me.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.640]   >> Oh, I know what it is.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.600]   You think that you're on your headset and you're not.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.360]   You're on your laptop, Mike.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.320]   >> That's Mike.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.960]   >> Because it wasn't muted.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.920]   >> Oh, you know what it is?
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.400]   Stupid Apple.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   Blame the computer.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   Blame the --
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   >> It is --
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   >> Actually --
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.600]   >> In respect to the joyous and wondrous OS X experience, the way it handles audio is
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   stupid.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   >> Really?
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   >> I'm sorry.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.160]   If a Windows -- if every Windows PC I've ever used will automatically turn off the internal
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.440]   mic, it's not like it's that hard when you plug in something externally.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.080]   >> It may also be the way it's done.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.720]   >> You have to manually go in and change the line in for it.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.160]   You're clear now?
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.960]   >> No, you're still on your -- on your laptop, Mike.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   That's why it was so noisy because --
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.160]   >> Yeah, you're typing away.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.800]   >> You need to select -- I think you need to do both in the sound preference painting.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   >> I just did change it over and stop doing the dance.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.920]   >> Yeah, it's still -- tap the laptop, Mike.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.720]   >> No, it sounds good.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.280]   You can't hear them typing now.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.840]   >> Okay, maybe we fixed it then.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.440]   >> The microphone sounds like a piece of crap, but that's another story.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440]   >> We won't.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.560]   Mr. von Neumann.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.760]   Are you using a Neumann or an audio technica?
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   >> Me?
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.760]   >> An AKG.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.440]   >> Oh, sorry.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.440]   What does AKG stand for?
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.200]   >> All cool graphite.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.920]   I don't know.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.600]   >> So, anyway, Skype.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   We love Skype.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.640]   We're dependent on this network, and it's scared that Willie's out of me when it was
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   down.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.760]   Is this bad for Skype or is this just the normal, you know, "Hey, it's Skype's been very reliable."
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.680]   >> Well, you know, this reminds me of about -- if you remember, about 10 or 15 years ago
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.320]   when AOL did a big upgrade, and they threw it online, and they went down for days.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.240]   >> And did you hear AOL?
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.880]   >> Sometimes these things, you know, they didn't upgrade at Skype, and sometimes these
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.600]   things don't work out in the real world.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.760]   It looked good in the lab and looked good in simulation, and then they threw this thing
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.360]   onto the real world, and bam, down it goes.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.760]   >> And I think down harder than anybody expected, they kept saying, "Oh, we'll be back in 12-24
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   hours."
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.160]   It was well more than 24 hours before it came back.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.320]   >> I would love to be in one of those meetings.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   >> Oh.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.600]   Can you imagine the table pounding that was going on?
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.240]   Patrick, are you there?
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.720]   We've lost Patrick, but he's still online.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   Maybe Skype's back down.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.200]   >> No, I don't think so.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   >> Okay.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   Patrick must be having trouble with his sound control panel.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   We'll move on.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.440]   >> It says that he's online here.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.120]   >> Yeah, I know, I see him.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.120]   That's why I can use --
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120]   >> Yeah, he's using a Macintosh.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.120]   This is the problem.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.280]   >> Why do you guys want to just bash Mac all the time?
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   What's wrong with you?
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.280]   >> I use a Macintosh and I like it.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.720]   >> Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   >> It's just limited.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.680]   It has a lot of things.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.200]   So I'm sitting last night with a designer who is going to help me do some design work.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.840]   And he brought up this interesting point that you start using that iPhone for a while
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.160]   and that crazy interface so you can flip things around and go through photos.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   >> You get spoiled.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.680]   >> Spinning and you go back to your computer and you hate it.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.520]   >> Yeah, you want to do all that stuff?
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   >> Is that me and you?
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.920]   >> No, but I have to say I'm looking forward to a computer that uses this touch interface.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.960]   I think that's a great interface and it really is a great way to work.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.040]   I guess if you work with graphics a lot as he obviously does, you kind of want to do
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.720]   that touching the screen, sizing, moving stuff around.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.720]   I don't know.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.520]   The drawback to it is you get fingerprints on grease all over your screen.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.320]   You're constantly cleaning the darn thing.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.360]   >> Yeah, but you can do it with the Google hand.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   I mean, if you --
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   >> It's the Google hand.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   >> Oh, I see.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.720]   >> You can just grab something and drag stuff around.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.320]   If you have a Wii from Nintendo and you go to the weather report because you have a built
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.920]   in Wi-Fi and so they usually go online for you.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   >> Right.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   >> And so you're going -- if you zoom out on the globe --
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.440]   >> Oh, can you use the Wii Moat to do that?
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.440]   Like throw it around?
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.440]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.520]   >> No, well, what you can do is you can grab the -- you can zoom out on the globe.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.360]   Like if you're looking for new stores, you zoom out and there's a big globe and you can
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.640]   grab it and spin it.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   >> Wow.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.720]   >> It's pretty much like the effect you get with the Apple.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.040]   >> I think, you know, Apple has not patented this.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.040]   They don't own it.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   It's, you know, obviously.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   >> Is that right?
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.280]   Because I thought they had 220 patents or something like that on this.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.760]   >> Well, they may, but, you know, the Microsoft Surface Table uses the same pinch.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.840]   I understand that that pinch technology is not owned by Apple and can be used by anybody.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.640]   So I expect you're going to see a lot of devices.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.400]   Let's get Patrick back on the line here.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   He's Skype crashed.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   >> Back to it.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.400]   >> Go ahead.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.200]   >> I was watching, for example, John Markoff has one of these phones and he was looking
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.400]   for a photo.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.360]   And I guess, you know, I'd only play with the phones.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   I didn't notice it.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.800]   But he's very dependent on -- he has, like, all these photos.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.000]   And then he just takes his thumb and you scroll -- you just throw the photos around.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.320]   You just make them into little thumbnails and you spin, spin, spin, and then they roll
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.000]   up the screen and you'll find what you're looking for pretty quickly.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.280]   >> The touch interface is great.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.800]   And I do think that -- and not particularly the iPhone touch interface, but just touches
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.080]   a nice way to work.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.960]   I don't know if it's the right way to work on a desktop computer, but sure is a great
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.000]   way on a handheld device.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   It works very well.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.360]   >> No, but I think still I'm still thinking of the Google Hand.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   Well, I guess you could do that.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   >> You know, a little hand comes up.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.360]   >> Right.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   And you kind of use --
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   >> The map.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   >> You still use your mouse, but you just be moving around.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   >> With a hand.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   >> With a hand.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.840]   >> You don't have an iPhone yet, John?
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   >> No, I'm not going to get one.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240]   >> What?
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.240]   You're going to wait to the next generation or you're not going to get one.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   >> I wait for Gen 3.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.880]   >> That's what my daughter said.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.760]   >> Must you know something?
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   >> I think young.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.360]   I skew young.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.720]   >> Did you see the iPhone, the 300-page iPhone bill, poor Justine?
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.280]   >> Yeah, and now there was another article to follow up article that 300-page for anyone
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.440]   out there wants to check this out.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.480]   You go to Google and look up 300-page bill or AT&T bill.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.680]   It'll come up to the top.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.320]   But anyway, some woman came out with a little movie and she showed this bill.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   It came in a box.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.160]   >> Yeah, Justine, she's been on the show many times.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.520]   >> Now, one of the things that started to show up now, I ran to an Australian blog where
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.120]   they were having this problem there too.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   >> It's huge bills.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.640]   >> AT&T, David Polk was the first to mention this about a month ago.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.000]   AT&T for some reason itemizes every data transaction.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.920]   And Justine is a younger generation.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.120]   She only had about 200 minutes on the phone, but she told us on the Mac break weekly, I
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.600]   think it was 30,000 text messages that month.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.760]   Every one of them is itemized.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.280]   >> It's ridiculous.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.280]   >> That's crazy.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   Every bite that you said.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.280]   >> That's really stupid.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.200]   But that's because you're talking about new generation, old generation thinking.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   >> They don't get it.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   >> They don't get it.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   >> No better.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.760]   >> Now AT&T says we can always give people a summary bill.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:34.560]   I didn't get a bill in the box because I immediately went to paperless billing anyway.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.600]   But I guess if you, she's an outlier.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.200]   I mean, most people get 20 pages or 30 pages.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   >> Well, yeah, but then again, don't you think having a big box full of a giant bill
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   as a collectible?
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.000]   >> Bill in the box.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   >> Bill in the box.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.200]   >> I mean, something you can put away and auction off or have your grandkids auction off.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   >> Look at this.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.160]   This is the way it used to be back in 2007.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.480]   >> Custom seven bucks to mailer the bill.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.640]   I just love that.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.800]   I think we should all just put AT&T out of its misery.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   Ask for paper bills fully itemized.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.520]   >> Yeah, get off that electron thing.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   Get it paper bills.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.840]   Make them grind these things out.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.120]   >> How long do you think it would last before they change their policies?
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.600]   Customs officials say that remember we talked last week about the downtime at Los Angeles
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.840]   International Airport.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.040]   Patrick, if we can get some audio out of Patrick, I think he's still having audio problems.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.320]   But I think he might have some.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   >> Can you hear me?
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   >> Yeah, we hear you now.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   That's great.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.880]   >> You know, for some reason, and I've run into several people that have had this.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.560]   Sometimes Skype won't work with the line input.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.960]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.640]   >> On MacBooks or MacBook Pros without restarting the system.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.760]   >> We tell everybody to use a USB device for that reason.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.720]   >> Every time I use a USB device, you spend the first five minutes of the podcasting telling
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.560]   me how crappy it is and that I should be using a USB device.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.920]   So I just gave up using them.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   Never mind.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   Forget it.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.640]   >> The sound good we're hearing you, that's all I care about.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.000]   >> The one microphone you actually do like is the one that's the fake phone with the
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.920]   headset with the plastic handset that costs like $8.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.920]   >> I know.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.920]   >> And every time I use that, you're like, hey, you're using.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   >> That sounds good.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   >> That sounds great.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   >> Oh.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   >> Well, there's actually a rationale for that.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.560]   Now I'm going to explain it because I have a Kodak 630, one of these little dual lens
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:31.160]   cameras that has the most amazing microphone in it for making little videos.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.400]   So I talked to a friend of mine who said that, you know, who's an audio engineer and he knows
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   about this.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.600]   He says, these microphones and probably that eight-buck microphone is one of them, are these
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.800]   buck 50 microphones that people get from China that aren't calibrated and it's a complete
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.240]   crapshoot, the quality can be astonishing or crap.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.520]   And there are apparently just as a fluke, you get astonishing quality out of a few of
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   them and you probably have one of them.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   >> Save that handset.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.800]   >> Yeah, don't get rid of that, Mike.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.200]   >> Don't let Aaron keep it at DLTV.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.680]   >> What he told me was that, you know, these things are so cheap that they can't, you know,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.480]   you could calibrate them and make them like really high quality, you could quality control,
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.120]   but then the micro, he would cost you 25 bucks to calibrate them so nobody does it.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.760]   So it turns out that the whole computer system, remember we talked about this last week, customs
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.080]   was down at LAX.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.240]   They were routing people, 17,000 passengers were stranded.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:30.160]   Turns out it was one computer with a bad network interface card was broke, was the broke the
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.920]   whole system down for nine hours.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.280]   One bad nick.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.880]   >> That's unbelievable.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.360]   >> It shows you they're a little bit maybe vulnerable, I don't know.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:48.440]   >> Well, did they talk about, is there something where if one of the nicks in the network is
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440]   a secured network?
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.400]   >> It was probably broadcasting or something, right?
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.680]   I mean, it was doing something weird.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.520]   In any event, you know, between this and the Skype outage, it just really reminds me how
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:06.440]   reliant we are in this technology and really frankly how non-bullet proof it is.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   >> You know, I think that the whole thing should be shut down.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.760]   Five years, that's all Elton John asks, five years without the internet.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.160]   >> I'm on his side now.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.640]   >> Sir Elton John and John C. Devorek together at last.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.080]   Do you believe the experts who say that they broke the speed of light?
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.120]   Is that possible?
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.600]   Is I insane or wrong?
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   >> I read that article three times and I still don't grok the whole like, you know, we create
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.280]   a wormhole inside of a molecule and it's faster than light and then in my head goes pop and
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.280]   I go back to reading.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.560]   >> What's funny is that's exactly leaves of grass.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:45.400]   What's funny is that this is exactly how sci-fi has said for years you'd be able to transcend
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   the speed of light.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.320]   >> You know, I'm very skeptical, but at the same time, somebody once pointed out to me
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:58.400]   that Einstein based his, you know, speed of light theses or at least some of his formulation
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.720]   on Edwin Mock who had a bunch of theories about how you can't, you know, that large
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.520]   objects can't go faster than the speed of sound.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   And that's where you got mock one.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.800]   >> And so, I mean, I've never been fully convinced that, you know, there's something that doesn't
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.120]   make sense about the fact that there's a limit to the speed something can go.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.400]   >> Well, I don't pretend to understand any of it, but according to two German physicists
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   say have forced light to overcome its own speed limit using quantum tunneling in an experiment
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.440]   microwave photons, which are energetic packets of light, appeared, and this might be the
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.760]   key word, appeared to travel instantaneously between two prisms forming the halves of a
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.600]   cube placed a meter apart.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.920]   >> Yeah, appeared here.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.120]   >> That's why I'm skeptical about this.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.000]   >> So you know, you know, that meme, the LOL cats or I can has cheeseburger, you know
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   that.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   >> We were talking about this.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I has your power.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   >> Last week.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.280]   So somebody sent me the link to Schrodinger's LOL cat.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.920]   Remember the Schrodinger thought experiment where you'd have a cat in a box and depending
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.240]   on whether you're observing or not, whether the cat would be dead.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.040]   There's a great, I'll have to put this on boy and boy, I'll have to put a link in your
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.040]   quantum, I'm in your quantum box, maybe.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:21.200]   >> It's actually the first LOL cat I've ever laughed at.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   So I just want to thank, I don't have the name of the person who sent that to me, but
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   thank you.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.240]   Bless you for sending that, that link to me.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.400]   That redeemed the meme.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.800]   >> That's a pretty awesome t-shirt too.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.200]   >> Yeah, wouldn't that be good?
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.600]   I'm in your quantum box.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.680]   >> Yeah, there's a cafe press.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.160]   >> Is there already?
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   There you go.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   There you go.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.160]   That's what happens.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.280]   So you were talking about this before we started.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.960]   This is called Wikipedia scanner, a guy at Caltech.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.560]   He's a graduate student in computation and neural systems means he's probably pretty
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.160]   smart.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.120]   He's offering users a searchable database.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.280]   Now you can always on Wikipedia look at the history and see who's edited it, but it's
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.600]   hard to go through it.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.560]   You have to go page by page.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.480]   This database ties millions of anonymous Wikipedia edits to organizations from which
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.640]   those edits apparently originated cross-referencing them.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.000]   Come up with some interesting stuff, hasn't he?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   >> Well, it's interesting that he's resolving IP addresses.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.480]   >> Well, you can do that with Riffic, that's illegal.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:29.560]   >> Well, basically he's created the Wikipedia scanner, which is a user searchable database.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.060]   >> That's lovely.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.600]   >> That works across basically looks at anonymous Wikipedia edits and to the organizations I
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:43.320]   assume by the IP range for where the changes basically they'll get the block of IP addresses
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.800]   that are associated with a particular IP address that's posted to change on Wikipedia.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.880]   >> It's wikiscanner.vergil.gr.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   >> And.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.880]   >> V-I-R-G-I-L.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.880]   >> V-I-R-G-I-L.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.320]   Wikiscanner.virgil.gr.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.280]   And then he has editors picks.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.760]   >> So you could see the Senate or debold.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.960]   >> A debold eliminating long paragraphs describing the technical problems of security
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.960]   in their system.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.200]   >> Oh, busted.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.080]   >> You know, information, but yeah, it's --
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.720]   >> I think this is a great -- this is a great --
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.000]   this is a good example of the kinds of things that computers do so well.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.240]   Walmart changing articles about Walmart.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.800]   Let's just pick a few here.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.320]   >> What's interesting is, like, the -- why I did a pretty good article about this.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.080]   And they pointed out that Walmart didn't really delete the criticisms, but, you know, added
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.720]   a few nice things to their entry.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.520]   >> Well, that's not so bad.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.000]   >> They spun it.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   >> They spun it.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   >> They spun it.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   That's Walmart.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   It's the shark of retail.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   It's like the most highly evolved shark in retail.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:00.040]   Now, by the way, Virgil was hired by the Wikimedia Foundation.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:05.680]   And Wikimedia Foundation -- this is the number one wired pick -- modified the story so that
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.880]   you don't know that he was hired by them.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.880]   >> Ah!
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   >> Ha ha!
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   >> I missed that one.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   >> Ha ha!
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   >> That's hilarious.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.280]   >> Microsoft White watches controversy, cost of ownership, Linux comparison, Halliburton
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.000]   and War Crimes, CIA -- this is an odd one.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.360]   The CIA -- somebody at the CIA vandalized Pope Benedict's entry at Wikipedia to say he's
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   the fawns.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.440]   Now, that's got to be an error.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.440]   >> What do they got a bunch of old -- what is the CIA doing this?
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.440]   >> Hey!
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.800]   Well, it's kind of funny because you look at, like, there's a whole link of editors'
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.360]   picks on the side of the Wiki scanner.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.320]   So DARPA.mil, you know, it's like, you know, Saturn disambiguation.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.160]   It's still a GM automobile brand at a Virginia Tech.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.200]   >> I'm thinking there's somebody -- you know, there's a bunch of jokers at the CIA with
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   nothing better to do.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.000]   They don't think anybody is obviously not tracking them because they're the CIA for
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   God's sake.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.840]   And these clowns are doing these joke entries as, you know, as some way to kill time in
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.160]   the office, I think it's hilarious.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.720]   >> Somebody at Greenpeace is modifying Ted Nugent's entry.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   >> What a shock.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   >> Philip Morris.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.400]   >> That doesn't make any sense.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.440]   >> I know.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.480]   >> Just -- this is -- you've got to read this.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.360]   This is the -- if you go to the Wired article, they've done a ton of them.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.680]   And I guess there's more coming all the time.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.040]   So -- but, you know, it just shows you, you know, not -- everything is alive on the net.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.360]   And when you post, I think people forget your internet address is right there.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.120]   >> This is what Tor was invented for.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.360]   >> Yeah. Maybe the CIA should learn something about Tor, perhaps.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   >> I don't know.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.920]   >> Just the thought.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:56.000]   >> Well, then again, it may be that the CIA is doing these posts to make it look as though
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.440]   they can be tracked when, in fact, the real posts that they're doing are done through
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.840]   some system that is completely untraceable.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.800]   >> It's wheeled with that system.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.720]   >> What is it named?
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.240]   Could be -- how about maybe the quantum system?
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.040]   >> Could be Walmart.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   >> Could be.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.000]   It's all -- you know, Walmart runs everything.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.440]   >> I think Walmart owns the CIA.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.640]   >> Here's another disclosure.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:27.200]   Redmond, Microsoft has hired two veteran lobbyists, Thomas Boggs and Kathleen Ireland,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   not Kathy Ireland, Kathleen Ireland, along with antitrust modernization commission,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.000]   Vice Chairman Clinton White --
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.520]   >> Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.520]   That's not his name.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.320]   Former Clinton -- this is what happens when you cut off a sentence.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   >> What is this?
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   >> It's delicious.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:54.920]   Former Clinton White House attorney Jonathan Yierowski to kind of lobby against Google
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.920]   buying double-click.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.360]   Microsoft doesn't like that idea.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   >> You're a housekeeper.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   >> He removed last year.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.280]   >> I don't like that idea.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.680]   Maybe Microsoft doesn't want Google to buy Wiki -- to buy double-click.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.240]   >> You know, Microsoft's finally learning the ropes about how to do things kind of through
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   the back door.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.840]   >> Google has a pretty active lobbying arm, I thought.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.520]   >> Every company that has evaluation in the building --
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.520]   >> Yada.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.000]   >> -- has an active lobbying, yeah.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.600]   It's everybody lobbies.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.160]   Everybody who's a big player in the industry has lobbyists.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.200]   Just to, you know, question of how effective they are.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:35.320]   >> Yeah, and heaven forbid that our legislature is actually work on behalf of the public.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.320]   >> Oh, John.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   John.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.320]   >> I'm just going to step back.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.920]   >> I'm going to step back.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.080]   >> Don't make me say weeping.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.880]   >> It's safe to say.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.320]   John, by the way, is this stock market crash?
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.920]   This is as long as we're talking about finance.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.080]   >> Yeah, because everyone knows I've got this theory.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.240]   >> Is this stock market crash the crash you've been talking about?
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   The bus burst?
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.040]   >> No, no, I see my belief is that there needed to be a huge direction anyway, so when you
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   have the real -- >> Is this correct?
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.600]   >> -- run up, what's this going to happen?
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.360]   Now, people like to point out that, oh, you know, you had this mortgage situation and
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.880]   triggered this whole thing.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:15.200]   And since my cycle is 80 years, I said, look, what happened 80 years ago, you had the Florida
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.600]   land crash almost to the -- well, actually a little earlier.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.400]   >> Oh, is this like the Florida land crash?
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.560]   >> So there's the Florida land crash, which caused the market to correct, and then you
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.480]   had your big run up, which will begin somewhere around me.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.280]   >> Which, by the way, my ancestors were involved in the Florida land crash.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   >> Really?
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.280]   Buying or selling?
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.920]   >> Yeah, I think they got stuck with a large cavity that rapidly became worthless.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.120]   >> And the long term, if they'd have held on to that property, it's good now.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.120]   >> It's good now.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   >> Long term investing.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.480]   >> Yeah, it would have been like a 60-year investment at that point.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:51.160]   >> Calla Canis says this could be a bad quarter for Web 2.0 companies for four reasons.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.000]   The stock market correction will affect online advertising.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   >> Probably.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   >> Probably.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   >> Which would affect us.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.920]   >> Most of them don't have a revenue stream, too.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.880]   Most of them that do have a revenue stream is going to be impacted by low advertising
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.880]   investment.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   >> Google and Apple stocks are going away, right?
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.200]   They're dying.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.360]   And so that's some, I don't know how that affects Web 2.0.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.040]   Technorati laid off eight people.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.400]   I don't know why that means anything.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.440]   Including by the way, the CEO is gone at Technorati.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.720]   I don't know what's going on over there.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:30.360]   Didn't Sifri, he stepped down, but it was kind of sudden.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.480]   The resignation effective immediately.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.440]   He'll remain a chairman of Technorati's board.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.280]   So maybe Technorati is the canary in the mind, the first Web 2.0 company to kind of disappear.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.760]   Oh, there's Bill McCrone.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.640]   Let's add Bill McCrone to the, hey, Bill.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   >> Hello.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640]   >> Welcome.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   We haven't had John Twitt in a long time.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   Glad to get you back.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.640]   >> Has been a while.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.120]   Let me add John's for some reason dropped off.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.880]   I'm going to add him back on.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.360]   We'll get back to work here.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.960]   Apple stocks looking pretty good.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.760]   If you take a look at it in like a six months or a year.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.160]   >> Yeah, but they've taken a dive in the last few days.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   >> Well, sure.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.560]   >> But they were up to 145, but they're still 120 in a year ago.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.560]   They were under 100.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.560]   >> Sure.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.760]   I think it was going to go to 170 and then crash, but it was good.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.960]   >> Google's down below 500 again, too.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.560]   >> Yeah, that's not going to last forever.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.600]   >> Google's a long-term hold on the Dvorak portfolio.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   The imaginary diver-
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.520]   >> Yeah, I should have probably, you know, I shouldn't even be writing about any of
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   this stuff.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   I should just bought the Google.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   >> I know.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.880]   >> I bought the Google.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.120]   So Bill, how you doing?
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   Haven't talked to you in ages.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.600]   How you, what's up to these days?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.080]   >> I'm doing just fine.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.280]   I'm still writing like a darn fool.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.520]   >> Sounds like you're typing now.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.520]   >> That's Patrick.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.520]   >> That's not me.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.520]   >> That's Patrick.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.520]   >> I'm not typing.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.520]   There's no typing going on.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.520]   >> He's making license plates again.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.520]   >> All right.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.480]   There is a mystery-typer on the line who is just trying to fill our heads with keyboard
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   sound.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.480]   >> That's it.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   That's it.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.040]   >> Moving along, we talked about Skype's outage and we actually have done a few stories already,
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.360]   but I'm glad you could join in.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.040]   We're talking right now about the notion that the stock market correction that's going
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.640]   on might be an indicator that bad times are ahead, especially for Web 2.0 companies.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.640]   >> Hmm.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.640]   >> And I'm an A-sayer.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.280]   I think it's just a blip.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.160]   >> Yeah, unless the Web 2.0 companies have a lot of real estate holdings, I really don't
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160]   see the connection.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.160]   >> Exactly.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160]   I don't either.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.160]   >> Good.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.840]   >> As a kind of a Web 2.0 company, I'm glad to hear that.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.400]   >> Why don't you want to identify with Web 2.0, Leo?
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.560]   >> Because I didn't want to be one of the one that went on your site.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.560]   >> I got it.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   >> As far as I'm pursuing it.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.560]   >> There's no Ajax.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   >> Is that the deciding?
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   >> It is for me.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.560]   If you've got no Ajax, you're not 2.0.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.360]   >> You know what?
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:51.560]   I am stealth 2.0 because all the Ajax is behind the scenes in the administration page.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.880]   There is in fact Ajax, a lot of it on my site, but you can't see it.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.280]   How do you like that?
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   >> It's talking about Ajax.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:02.800]   I'm really disappointed in the fact that Ajax is being promoted to such an extreme because
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.680]   I find it on a lot of pages, and besides the fact that it screws up everybody's numbers,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.720]   I find it on a lot of pages that have to time Ajax if it's not perfectly implemented,
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.680]   then you get these menus and then you go to select something, the menu goes away or it
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.680]   moves over to the left, you're chasing it around the screen to try to click on something
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.160]   and it doesn't highlight right away.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.040]   I mean, I think it's just a joke.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.760]   >> Well, I have to say if it's done, partly it's the worst thing in the world and it does
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.760]   take a lot of work.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.760]   You know what?
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.880]   Maybe it's a way to ensure work for those who can figure it out.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.400]   >> It's not supposed to be difficult.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.560]   It's supposed to just be standards.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.400]   >> Yeah, it's tough though.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:44.160]   And partly because that no browser really adheres to the standards.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.920]   So you're doing versions for Explorer, for Firefox.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:52.400]   >> Opera people would take tremendous offense because they work very hard to conform to
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   the standards.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   >> And how many pages does Opera work well with?
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.520]   >> Well, that's the cruel irony.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.760]   >> What about Safari for Windows?
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   Safari for Windows?
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:06.480]   I recommend people take loads of Safari for Windows and go to the KQED site in San Francisco,
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.200]   Channel 9s and take a look at the TV schedules with Safari and see what you end up.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.400]   >> Unreadable, yeah.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.520]   You can't use Google Spreadsheet with Safari.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.520]   So this is the problem is that a lot of Ajax breaks, not because it's not standard, but
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.720]   because the browsers are implementing it all over the place.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.400]   Apple and Dell have slipped in customer satisfaction rankings.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:34.800]   In fact, overall the PC industry slightly fell in the second quarter of the year.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.880]   Mostly I think because of problems at Apple and Dell.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:48.480]   This is the University of Michigan citing the American customer satisfaction index data
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:54.640]   saying that each Apple and Dell drop 5 percentage points in customer satisfaction.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.520]   Still Apple number one, but only a measly 79% customer satisfaction.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.360]   >> Well, Dell's got other problems.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.800]   They have to restate all their earnings for the last four years.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.560]   >> Let's talk about that.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.240]   >> That's kind of interesting.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.880]   I mean, I don't see that as that far away from having some sort of a federal investigation.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.360]   >> Isn't that the same variation on the theme that Apple's been having the troubles with?
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.760]   >> No, it's not an options thing.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.280]   I think it's- >> It's not an options partner.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.920]   >> Yeah, no, this is just statements.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   Statements of earnings.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:28.080]   >> In order to appear more successful and Dell's internal audit discovered this and they admitted,
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.600]   I mean, they stepped forward, which I imagine helps a little bit in dodging prosecution.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.360]   But still Dell concluded Thursday that this is my favorite.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.640]   Some employees had misled its auditors.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.880]   >> Like what?
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.560]   The guy who makes the and manipulated results to meet performance goals for more than four
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.560]   years.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.160]   >> Some guy on the assembly line.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   >> Some employees.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.120]   Well, let me think, CFO, I don't know.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.480]   Dell said the net income is about $50 to $150 million lower.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.800]   That's $2 to $0.7 per share lower than stated.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:10.080]   Now it's a $55 billion company, but still, $2 to $0.7 a share is not insignificant.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:15.160]   >> Well, to the SEC, this story is not going away any time soon.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.400]   >> No, they just announced that federal regulators have not said anything yet, but I expect we'll
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.680]   hear a lot more about this soon.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   It's interesting.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.040]   >> But according to every state of earnings anymore without going to jail, I think it's
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.040]   horrible.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.800]   >> Well, the question is why the earnings were rare in the first place.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   That's the thing.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.960]   You got to please the investors.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.560]   You got to get those quarterly numbers in there and you got a ship product.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.160]   So you need to restate things once in a while.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.800]   >> I got this little age you're going to do before a Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   I can tell you that right now.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:54.920]   >> I'm getting a lot of mail, John, because John is on a campaign against stocks.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.080]   By the way, most of the mail is from auditors saying, "No, stocks is a great thing."
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.320]   >> Oh, yeah, he's got you cleaning up.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.920]   >> He's offered a cleaning up on this scam.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:10.240]   >> All right, let me quote Matthew Johnson, subject line misunderstandings of Sarbanes
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.040]   Oxley.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.760]   In recent episodes, John seems to be confused about what Socks is all about.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   I'm a CPA.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.680]   >> No, no, wait a minute.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   No, wait a minute.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.320]   Who's an IT auditor and I've been performing internal and external Socks audits since companies
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.680]   were required to be compliant in 2004.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.400]   He works for a big four accounting firm.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.880]   So I think I have a pretty good perspective on the process.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.320]   First, I'll agree with this statement that the rules imposed under Socks about what types
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.840]   of services audit firms can sell to their audit clients as something the Anderson auditors
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.680]   at Enron should have followed.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   A law was not necessary for that though.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.680]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.720]   John's dispute about Socks is the part of the law called Section 404, which roughly
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.320]   states that management must maintain internal controls over their financial reporting process.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.360]   This is for all the back office business processes and IT controls.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.360]   This has been desperately needed because auditors have four years been begging companies to adopt
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.280]   these strong internal controls.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   That's easier.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.120]   Makes it easier to audit a company.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.000]   The strong controls an auditor can rely more on the controls and have to test less of the
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   individual transactions.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.960]   Socks is helping to fix these issues.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   He says it's just growing pains.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.960]   >> It's not an issue.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.920]   This is like a guy typically saying, you know, this makes my job a lot easier.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.920]   So John's full of crap.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:34.600]   >> The real joke is when you go out and you look at all of the enterprise software and
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.840]   it all advertises itself as Socks compliant.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.400]   And there is nothing for it to be compliant too.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.560]   It's a complete scam.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:53.600]   You guys remember 15 years ago when everything was new, now with AI edit.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.680]   Socks compliance is just the latest scam.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.200]   >> Actually, I'm putting Socks compliant on my blog.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.920]   The blog, it's Socks compliance.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.760]   >> You have internal audits in place?
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   Internal controls?
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.280]   >> No, I don't need to because I'm not a public corporation, but thus I'm Socks compliant.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.240]   >> Oh, there you go.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.920]   He also says, because this is one of your contentions, John, is that there are no IPOs
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.320]   because of Socks.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.120]   He says it's due to risks of litigation, not Socks.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.120]   >> Ha.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.720]   Ha, ha, ha, I say.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.400]   There's always been risks of litigation.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   What's changed?
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.040]   What is changed in the scheme of things?
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   It's Socks.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.640]   It's the only new variable.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.280]   >> He sent us a link and I'll send it to you to an odd piece.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.600]   >> I got the letter from the guy.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.760]   I got like 10 letters, probably from all from the same guy and he probably works with some
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.680]   big eight accounting firm and that's the end of it.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.680]   >> Big four, he says.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.680]   >> Big four, I'm sorry.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   What am I thinking?
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.680]   >> Even better.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.000]   >> He's right, there's only four left.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.440]   >> It used to be eight.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.520]   Let's see, moving along to yet another controversial story.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.960]   Boing Boing says, the reporters with the Associated Press has seen it and I might ask you about
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:10.440]   Markov as well, are suing Hewlett Packard and former HP executives, including former
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:16.720]   chairwoman Patricia Dunn and former ethics chief Kevin Hunsacher over the spying that
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.960]   the HP did on these journalists.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.480]   Remember HP kind of got off.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.720]   They got let off the hook on this.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.320]   But now they're civil suits.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:31.680]   They're seeking damages for illegal and reprehensible conduct and an invasion of privacy.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.680]   >> Oh.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.640]   >> Now Markov was one of the guys who was protected and spied upon us.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.640]   Is he a part of this suit?
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.640]   Is he?
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.400]   He was pretty upset, I remember.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   >> I've talked to him about this and you know, apparently the New York Times has looked
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.960]   into whether he should sue.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.120]   I think there's something going on.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.160]   He hasn't made a decision to sue.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.440]   The way it looks is probably, I'm not thinking he's going to, but if these other four guys,
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.560]   you know, the way you want to do a suit like this is let these other four guys go in and
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.200]   throw their money away.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.680]   If they win, hey, it's a walk away.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.600]   You just walk in and you just tell them to give you a check.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.400]   >> Me too, your honor.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.880]   The charges against Dunn were dropped.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:17.800]   She had a resign, but they were dropped and the rest were reduced to community service.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.080]   So they really got let off on this one.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.080]   >> That will.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.800]   >> And HP paid $13.5 million to California to establish a fund for law enforcement activities
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.600]   related to privacy.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.120]   >> There's at least one or two reporters, one works for Forbes, everybody over there
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.560]   knows who he is, that apparently was just steaming and livid.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.560]   >> Oh, I'd be curious.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.560]   >> He wasn't pre-texted.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:46.360]   >> They weren't looking at me.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   >> They were looking at me.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   >> A hunter s Thompson Rance.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.840]   >> Why did they leave me out?
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.000]   >> For those who didn't follow the story, remember this was all about leaks from the
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.480]   HP boardroom that HP was trying to track down.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:04.760]   Not only did they tap their own board member, more members, but they were tapping and pre-texting
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.600]   reporters at the same time.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   >> I don't know.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   I just said that.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   >> I don't know.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.360]   I mean, it'd be interesting to see how it came out.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.800]   I think it's a wheel spinning.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.400]   I mean, the thing is, what did these guys find out that was so damaging against anyone
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   for a person?
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.080]   I mean, it's like, well, this guy's sure dull.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.320]   >> Are they doing it because they want to make sure other companies are more highly
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.720]   motivated than not doing it?
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.240]   Are they doing it for a payday or does it really matter?
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   >> What do you think?
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   A payday, of course.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.920]   >> Why else would you sue?
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.920]   >> Absolutely.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   >> Why else?
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.640]   >> To make the world better, John, remember?
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.640]   Remember, you were being all hopeful.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.200]   >> What are you from?
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.800]   >> Frankly, this is the most depressing tweet we've ever done.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.480]   It's like the world is sucks.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   Everybody's corrupt and socks is ruining everything.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.640]   >> This is a great supply of the creative and their drivers.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.040]   >> All right, go ahead.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:57.240]   Patrick's been dying at slam creative about the drivers.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.320]   >> Is there a company with worth's drivers supporting creative?
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   >> Creative, who?
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.160]   >> ATI, creative class.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.400]   >> Creative labs to get those sound car people?
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   >> What do you use that?
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   They still build us?
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.400]   >> Sure.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.640]   >> Yeah, well, I had a car that I got an older system I use for writing and web browsing
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.440]   and stuff, and I wanted to reinstall the audio card in it.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.800]   And of course, the audio card is no longer supported.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.880]   But you can still search their website for drivers, all of the drivers and all of the
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.880]   related content to that has been deleted.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.920]   >> And this really bothers you.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.920]   I mean, what was the card?
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.280]   A $15 card or a $17 card?
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.880]   >> I was like $125 card when I bought it.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   >> In its day?
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   >> Wow.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.720]   >> That's worth three bucks now.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:48.320]   >> Yeah, but I'm sorry, I come from the terrible, like I bought it, it still works.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.800]   I shouldn't need to replace it kind of camp.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.560]   I know that makes me terribly old-fashioned.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.720]   >> It's weird.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.720]   >> It's just sad that they can't even be bothered.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.040]   I mean, obviously, it's miserable problems with driver support, with Vista and other things.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.760]   But it's just kind of like, couldn't you at least keep the old drivers around on your
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.760]   website or do you just--
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.280]   >> Oh, yeah, I agree with that.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280]   What's the call off?
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.400]   >> Well, maybe it was, well, they want to drive people into, you know, this is also the company
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:21.200]   that used to never allow you to download drivers if you lost your installation disk for audio
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.920]   cards for a bunch of years.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.720]   >> You know what, Patrick, people should just shouldn't buy those products from companies
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   like that.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.720]   >> True.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.720]   All right, turtle beach it is.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.840]   >> I mean, Sound Blaster isn't even the standard anymore.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.680]   >> It's not, is it?
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.280]   On Motherboard audio is completely taken over everywhere, AC-97.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.360]   >> Well, a lot of people use them.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.880]   A lot of people like the X5 cards.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.880]   >> Who?
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.880]   >> X5?
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.880]   >> Who?
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.880]   >> I haven't heard of this.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.960]   >> I mean, I have one on one of my machines, but, you know, I've got that X5 extreme with
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.880]   a whole external thing, and it sure is swell, but frankly, I never use it.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.280]   >> It's just a sound card.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   >> But X5 is--
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.280]   >> I like this as a term, it's swell.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.280]   >> No, no.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.480]   You just love my folksy terms, John.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.280]   I know you've been at for two decades.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.280]   >> I got to get MacPron and Pornell on together on one podcast every day.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   >> But on a show.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   >> Hey, the X5--
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   >> Go ahead.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.280]   >> X5.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.240]   >> X5 is a creative product, though, right?
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240]   It's a Sound Blaster.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:27.400]   >> It has one neat feature, John.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.400]   It's really swell.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.160]   >> Actually, my version of that is nifty.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.160]   I love things.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   >> No, it's nifty.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.960]   >> Nifty is O'Korant.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   This is Nisse.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960]   >> Wow.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.840]   >> And that's the 24-bit crystallizer.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840]   >> What's that, dude?
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.800]   >> 24-bit crystallizer.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   >> Is that what you--
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   >> It's travel in time?
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.640]   >> Travel in split.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:57.560]   >> It actually kind of does, because it takes games and upgrades them to extreme fidelity.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   >> It does.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:04.320]   It takes CD quality audio, and it adds another 4-bit quality to it.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   It's a decompressor.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   >> How could that work, though, a built-in?
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   >> I could get that.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.320]   >> If that sounds bought.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.360]   >> If the data's not paused.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.920]   If the data's not there, what do you add 4-bits?
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.320]   What does a 4-bit come from?
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:26.400]   >> Well, decompression is a well-known art, and there's lots of compression on-- especially
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.400]   on CD music.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.400]   >> Really?
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.400]   It's compressed?
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:36.240]   >> Yeah, because, well, you only have 16 bits of range, and that's not enough.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.800]   You had more on a well-engineered vinyl record.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:46.040]   >> So, we're going to get, by the way, to an anniversary this week of the CD in a second.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.040]   >> 25 years.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.720]   >> All right, but don't rush it, because I have--
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.240]   >> It's too-- overall, you, though, you like the effect.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.520]   >> I think the crystallizer is awesome.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.080]   >> Is it like an expander?
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.080]   What is it doing?
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   I don't understand how it goes.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.920]   >> It expands the high end.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.520]   It increases the dynamic range, and it just makes the music sound better.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:14.800]   There's an analog product that lots of studio musicians and even live musicians use, called
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.080]   the BBE Sonic Maximizer.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.280]   And you just find these in every recording studio and in most stage things.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.560]   And it just takes what's coming out of the microphones and the console and maximizes it.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   >> Huh.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.800]   Well, I want one.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.800]   I want to be used to--
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.360]   >> It's stuff like this usually cruds up the audio more than it helps it.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.040]   It's kind of nice to hear something that actually--
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.080]   >> Well, yeah, and I trust Bill, because, I mean, Bill really knows about audio.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.840]   So if you say so, I believe you.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.840]   >> It really does work.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.440]   It really does sound spectacular.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.080]   So you can rerecord your music maximized.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.080]   >> Wow.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.280]   >> So that's the statistic called the crystallizer and it comes with what piece of--
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:00.000]   >> Well, it comes on a couple of models of the creative X5, and I just happen to have
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.720]   the-- I guess it's the extreme, the one with the external console.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.000]   >> Extreme music, it says.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.280]   Patrick, is this what you're trying to get a creative driver for?
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   Is this particular unit?
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.240]   >> He's trying to get for some clunker.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.120]   We're on a CPM, apparently.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.640]   You got your X5 Elite Pro, your X5 Platinum Fatality Champion Series.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.120]   >> Well, with all due respect to the crystallizer, and I am curious now, why would I go out
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.760]   and, you know, why would I go out and spend another 100 bucks on a sound carbon and have
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.000]   a perfectly good AWE 64 that's been serving me for all these years.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   >> AWE 64.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   >> Aww.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   >> Aww.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   That's neat.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   And boss.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.640]   >> I get my old Nash ambassador, and it still runs.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.560]   So you have-- because you have the breakout box, you must have the Platinum version.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.360]   It looks like that's the one with the breakout box.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.080]   >> I guess that's right.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   >> That's right.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.080]   All right.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   And how much is that?
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   >> No idea.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.080]   >> A lot.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   >> No idea.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.080]   159.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.080]   >> Aww.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.580]   It works with Vista.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.080]   There's the good news.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.080]   Huh.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.520]   All right, we're going to celebrate a couple of birthdays.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:13.100]   As you said, the CD is celebrating its 25th, but you know, this is the anniversary of the
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.300]   day of Elvis's death or was this week anyway.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.300]   Yes.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.020]   And actually a little old lady was camping at Graceland and passed away.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.020]   >> Aww.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.020]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.580]   That's kind of sad.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.780]   But it made me think there must be a great book on audible.com.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.940]   >> About camping at Graceland.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.420]   >> About Elvis.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.900]   And there is Jerry Schilling who played college ball.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:47.900]   Or no, I'm sorry, high school football with Elvis and state his friend, his bodyguard,
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:52.260]   his photo double, and even a co-executive producer on a karate film.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.460]   Elvis is confident.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.460]   It's hard not to laugh.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.340]   >> Well, let me, hey, hold on a second.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.340]   Let me write this down.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:59.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:04.260]   It's called me and a guy named Elvis, my lifelong friendship with Elvis Presley.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.780]   Jerry Schilling, you want to hear a little bit of it?
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.580]   Because you know, you're going to lie for us.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.580]   >> I'm in.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.580]   >> This is good.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.580]   Yes, you're going to hear it.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.580]   >> Next five.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.860]   >> All the six points where Elvis movies play nonstop.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.860]   >> That's right.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:17.860]   >> That's another tricky summer.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   >> That's right.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.780]   >> Here's the story of him meeting Elvis.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:25.060]   >> Well, the old kid living at the Little Brick Duplex, my father rented on Breedlove
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:30.980]   Street looking for some way to fight off the boredom of one more stretch of sweltering
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:31.980]   afternoon.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.780]   >> This is before Twitter, of course.
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:40.060]   What he does is he starts a touch football game and and Ebis is the quarterback.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.060]   So anyway, that's our audible pick.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.700]   I just figured we should do something topical.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:45.700]   >> That was very topical.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   Very good.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.700]   It had nothing to do with tech, but it was very topical.
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.700]   >> Well, you can't always.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.540]   There are plenty of tech books, by the way, on Audible.
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.540]   Audible, Audible, Audible.com.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.620]   >> Sorry I mentioned it.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:56.620]   >> We want to encourage you.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.180]   Audible is a sponsor of the show and we really appreciate it.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.180]   They've just been a great sponsor.
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.700]   And you know, I'm joking around, but you know, that's actually a fun book to listen
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.700]   to.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.860]   It's got 4.75 stars out of five.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:15.180]   So people love this book if you're 14 hours of Ebis and it could be yours for free.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:19.140]   You get a credit when you join Audible, you go to audible.com/twit and you can pick a
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.180]   book from there, thousands of great books.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.380]   You could pick a different book, John.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.380]   You got another book?
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.580]   Well, you know, it seems to me that since we're on the show plugging this company since
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.140]   they're a sponsor, some sort of an extra special deal.
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.820]   So we didn't have to buy any books.
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.540]   >> Just like that for you or for everyone, John?
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.180]   >> Well, I just, I don't care about you, to be honest about it.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.860]   >> Just for you, man.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.820]   >> You want me to arrange a subscription to Audible for you, John?
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.820]   >> No, that's okay.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.420]   >> I don't have a free one.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.380]   I pay 15 bucks a month and it's worth it.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.580]   I get two because I'm, I'm grandfathered in.
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.820]   They don't have that deal anymore.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.580]   But it's a, I love Audible.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.220]   I am a, you know, I subscribe when I used to commute to tech TV and I had spent three
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.020]   hours a day in the car and I still don't, you know, I don't spend any time in the car
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.020]   anymore and I still.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.420]   >> You know, the problem with me, I don't listen to enough of these books.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:10.740]   I should have, and the rest of the family are booked, you know, listening to book addicts.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   >> Oh, really?
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.740]   >> Everybody does.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.500]   And except me, I listen to the right wing talk radio.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.900]   >> And he's a Michael Savage fan.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.860]   >> It's kind of like, it's kind of pathetic.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.860]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:21.860]   >> Who do you listen to?
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.860]   >> That's where you get your material, John?
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   >> I think so.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.860]   >> I get a lot of it from these guys.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.860]   Get yourself.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.860]   >> Who do you listen to?
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:27.860]   >> I listen to all the bit.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:28.860]   >> Savage?
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:29.860]   >> I do listen to this.
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.860]   >> Riley.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.860]   >> Because he's, you know, he's the most entertaining.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.860]   >> He's hysterical.
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.340]   >> I also listen to Rush Limbaugh occasionally.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:40.940]   The problem with Limbaugh is he's up against now Jim Rome, who I consider to be one of
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:41.940]   the great broadcasters that--
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.460]   >> Rome is actually very good.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.540]   >> I actually, my radio show comes out of the Jim Rome studio.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.260]   >> Yeah, well Jim Rome is unbelievable.
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.940]   And it'd be mainly because he created his own world.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.580]   I mean, he's got his own lingo, and he's got his own kind of group of people.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.580]   >> That's what you gotta do.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.300]   >> He berates his customers in a very funny way.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.700]   And then what's in the comic is on at that same time.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   >> Franken?
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.700]   >> Dennis Miller.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.700]   >> Oh, Miller.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.700]   >> He's on one of these stations at the same time as Limbaugh.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.860]   He's toast because of this.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:17.140]   I mean, he's sandwiched between Limbaugh and Rome at the morning hours.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.100]   And he's actually, he shows actually gotten fairly good.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.980]   So I'm clicking between him because, you know, the trouble is everyone runs on the same
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   clock in radio.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.580]   I tell everybody wants to know why you hit the button, and everyone's got a commercial
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:27.580]   scene.
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.580]   >> Well, that's why.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.580]   We don't want you to leave us.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:33.060]   So they have these clocks that are, but sometimes the clocks go out of sync and then you can
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.380]   make a lot of jumps back and forth.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:43.660]   >> Well, that's just a long roundabout way of saying listen to Audible Books, audible.com/twits.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.500]   We thank them for their support this week in tech.
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.500]   >> What an ad.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.980]   >> Now, ladies and gentlemen, let us celebrate, let us commemorate the 25th anniversary of
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:59.460]   the CD on August 17th, 1982.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.780]   Now there's some debate.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:08.500]   According to an article by the BBC, the first CD produced was The Visitors by ABBA.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.780]   But if you read the official press release, I think Phillips Corporation who made this
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:16.300]   first CD was a little embarrassed to have the notion that the first CD was ABBA.
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.620]   So they say it was a record Strauss Waltz.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:22.820]   >> I think it was a record Strauss Waltz because I remember these things first came out.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.700]   I remember the first thing being a classical recording.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.540]   >> Well, there you go.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.100]   They produced it in August.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.060]   Nobody had a CD player till October.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:36.980]   Bill, do you remember when you, do you remember your first CD, Bill?
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.980]   >> Absolutely.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.500]   >> Must have been classical, right?
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.420]   >> Well, no.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:47.900]   It was when the, when Burr released the Ella Fitzgerald song book on CD.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.860]   >> What a great, what a great.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:55.140]   >> That was the reason to buy all of the, the LSCDs and buy a player.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.740]   Were you happy with the quality of the first CDs you heard?
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.220]   >> Surprisingly, yes.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.860]   Of course, those were really carefully engineered.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.700]   I'm sure they could be done even better now.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:12.100]   But, you know, when you had engineers sitting there just loving the experience in gain
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:18.300]   riding and scratch filtering and doing all that stuff, they, they really did a superb
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.300]   job.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.260]   Those CDs still sound great to me.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:27.740]   Phillips did the hardware, Sony did the software, the firmware for the player.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.500]   And there's, you know, there's debate also about why the CD was the size it is, the length.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:36.060]   Some say it's the size of a Dutch beer coaster.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.500]   That I find hard to find that hard to believe.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.700]   >> I thought it was, go ahead.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.940]   >> Well, I understood it was pocketable with very, you know, you put it in a spot.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.940]   >> It was pockety.
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.940]   >> It was a pocketable.
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:48.940]   >> The same pocket that fit the Walkman, right?
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.620]   >> Or the Dutch beer coaster, actually.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.060]   They all fit in the same pocket.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.740]   The other theory is that a Sony.
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.260]   >> I've been to Holland a lot.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.060]   And I've never seen a beer coaster that size ever.
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:59.660]   >> All right, all right.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:03.140]   Well, maybe you'll believe this story that a Sony executive said, wait, I don't care
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.620]   what size it is as long as it's long enough to hold Beethoven's ninth.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.420]   And in fact, it is just.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.220]   And that makes sense because you don't want to break up Beethoven's ninth.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.220]   >> No.
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:14.220]   No.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:19.820]   >> I was thinking more, it holds the second live at the Apollo recording by James Brown.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.820]   What an amazing album.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:26.220]   >> You know, that ends right at the end of the length of the CD.
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.420]   Yeah, it's a great album.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.020]   One of the great collectibles.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.540]   >> 69 minutes and 59 seconds.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.540]   God.
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.460]   And it's over.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.460]   So what was your first CD, Mr. Patrick Norton?
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.020]   I'm sure you remember.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:44.700]   >> Actually, I'm not sure if it was REM's life's rich pageants or if it was a Joe Jackson album.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.420]   >> Oh, Joe Jackson is sounding good on CD.
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.420]   How about you, John?
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.900]   >> You know, I can't remember.
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.500]   I mean, I have so many of these really old ones.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.580]   It was some early rock things, some sort.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.300]   >> I remember very well for some reason.
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.980]   I think a lot of people remember their first CD's.
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.020]   Mine was "Rocksy Music Avalon."
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.540]   And I picked it because I thought, well, this will sound good on CD.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.540]   It will be well produced.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.540]   And it did sound good.
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.540]   >> Yeah, I think mine was the, what was the song?
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:10.540]   >> '99 Luft Balloons.
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.540]   >> Never mind.
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.660]   But I think I remember it.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.700]   But I can't, for some reason, I can't remember what it is.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.100]   >> Well, it was 25 years ago.
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.100]   That's why.
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.100]   >> Huh.
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.380]   >> Happy anniversary CD.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.740]   And of course, the CD is a dying medium now.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.740]   It reached its peak.
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:30.980]   >> Well, wait a minute, Leo, before you finish, you should mention that to this day, 200 billion
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.540]   of these babies have been sold.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.540]   >> Wow.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.540]   >> 200 billion.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.540]   >> That's a lot of plastic.
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.020]   >> Sure is.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:40.580]   >> The peak was 2001 when it sold 700 million.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:45.380]   It's down now to about 550 million units a year in the US.
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.060]   So it is kind of dying out.
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:48.060]   You think it'll last?
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.900]   >> I don't know.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.900]   I don't think so.
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:52.900]   >> How much longer for the CD?
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.900]   How long before downloadable music supersies?
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:56.900]   >> Back up data.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.700]   I'm backing up all my data now on DVDs.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.700]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:04.980]   >> Yeah, but the thing is that music needs to be sold at higher bit rates.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:10.340]   And right now online, a lot of the bit rates you can get music at is garbage.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:14.700]   >> A lot of record producers are saying that.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.020]   They're upset by the 128 kilos.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.620]   >> 128 sucks.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:23.860]   192 begins to be listenable.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:29.140]   >> 192 is the beginning of acceptable if you have a decent system.
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:33.940]   >> We've talked about this before though, that consumers don't seem to care anymore.
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:34.940]   >> They can't.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.100]   >> Well, all these, these kids, they all have 10 years because they put those plugs in their
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.300]   ears, they crank it up their half-death.
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.620]   When they talk to you, they yell at you because they think they're talking to the low voice.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.580]   >> Is it that John, is it that so much or is it that we have an entire generation that's
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:53.580]   been raised on digital cable or satellite with heavy compression on the channels?
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:54:01.380]   They started downloading music in their early teen years in MP 128 megabit MP3 format off
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:04.060]   the internet which sounded crappy now.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:07.180]   Just as crappy now is it sounded then?
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.740]   And the standards have kind of been lowered.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.140]   It's amazing when you think about just exactly much.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:17.660]   You look at it in sort of standard deaf television and it's amazing how crappy it is on a lot
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:20.740]   of cable that works compared to what it is on over the air because they're compressing
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:27.340]   it and they're squeezing it because I need that extra 300 channels on DirecTV.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.340]   It's frustrating.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.420]   >> Good article by Joel Selvin in The Chronicle, he quotes Phil Ramon, the great record producer
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.620]   saying, "You can get used to awful.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.900]   You can appreciate nothing.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.100]   We've done it with fast food.
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.100]   We're doing it with music."
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.540]   >> I agree with you, Patrick, to a point.
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:45.380]   The other thing is if you go out and hang out with some guys who manufacture speakers,
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:47.820]   they say nobody buys speakers anymore.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:53.220]   They have these things in their ears and they crank it up and they go deaf and then the
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.740]   sound's not going to be any range anywhere when you've got this thing pumping, injecting
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.140]   sound directly to the ear drum.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:04.540]   Within a few years, they don't give a crap what things sound like.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:09.580]   He has a nice speaker systems and sits back and relaxes and tries to imagine the sound
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:10.580]   stage.
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:11.580]   Nobody.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.580]   >> Home theater people.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.580]   >> Home theater people.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.500]   >> They're not listening to music even.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.060]   They're listening to explosions.
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.060]   >> Exactly.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:25.500]   But those subwoofers really do come in handy for a lot of orchestral stuff too.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.500]   >> Interesting.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.500]   >> Totally.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.500]   I'm a good -- but you're an old guy.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.500]   >> That's true.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.500]   I'm an old part.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.100]   >> We're all old farts, except for Patrick.
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.980]   >> Like, you know, so we can complain about this from our perspective.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.140]   But eventually it's going to be revitalized.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:42.100]   There will be a comeback because somewhere along the line someone's going to discover,
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:45.860]   you know, hey, these things that we're doing, it stinks.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:46.860]   It sounds crummy.
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.020]   Listen to this guy's thing.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:54.180]   >> I'm going on in this article and this might lend credence to this rebirth.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:58.100]   Guy named John Meyer who builds speakers at Meyer Soundlines and Berkeley, very high-end
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:05.060]   speakers, says, "The truth is literally poor audio does not touch you as much as better
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.060]   audio.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:10.100]   He says it turns you into an observer because the brain is working harder."
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.260]   This is how MP3 works.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:17.300]   It takes out parts of the sound that you don't need to hear and the brain has to solve this
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:21.100]   and it's working so hard that you don't actually get -- it stimulates the brain in a different
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.100]   way.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:27.500]   They quote a guy, Dr. Robert Sweetow, who's head of UC San Francisco's audiology department.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:31.100]   He says, "Poor fidelity music stimulates the brain in different ways with different
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.780]   neurons, perhaps lesser neurons stimulated.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.380]   There are fewer cortical neurons connected back to the limbic system where the emotions
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:43.340]   are stored so this crappy compressed music doesn't move you in the way that high quality
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.340]   music does."
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:50.780]   >> There's another interesting statistic there too and that is that the average dynamic range
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:53.620]   for popular music is 3 dB.
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:54.620]   >> Wow.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:55.620]   >> That's not --
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:56.620]   >> That's not a lot.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:57.620]   >> That's not true.
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:58.620]   >> That's the compression.
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.620]   >> That's a compression.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.620]   That means it's so highly compressed.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.620]   >> Check it out, John.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.620]   It's true.
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.620]   >> I'll buy into that because --
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.620]   >> That's horrible.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.620]   >> Well, it has to sound good on the radio.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.620]   >> Exactly.
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.620]   >> That's not good on the radio and also it's amazing.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.740]   I mean, it's funny to listen to orchestral music if you've been listening to a lot of rock
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:17.380]   and roll because once you get past the late '60s, early '70s, there's not a whole lot of
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.540]   dynamic range built into most albums.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:20.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:23.900]   When you're running that situation where there's a flute or a piccolo and then all of a sudden
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.180]   the entire orchestra jumps in and it blasts you back in your seat, which is what it was
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:32.980]   supposed to do, but you know, that can be a little -- it's just not the way music's
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:33.980]   built anymore.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:34.980]   >> Exactly.
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:35.980]   >> All right.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.980]   Well, that brings me to the first CD I bought, which was the Money for Nothing, What's the
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:39.980]   Name of That Grew?
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   Dire Straits.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.980]   >> Dire Straits for --
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.860]   >> That album had a huge dynamic range.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:48.100]   One of the things I liked about it, especially the early one, I think I had maybe even the
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:52.620]   Japanese pressing, is that the dynamic range was so outstanding, especially when that song
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:57.100]   began that you could demonstrate your stereo system using the CD player to people and
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.740]   would just blow them out of the room.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.980]   Because you know, as we know, as you have a 90 dB headroom on those things and they were
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:07.380]   taken advantage of it, but if everything's been compressed down to three, it's ludicrous.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:08.380]   What's the point?
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.380]   >> Exactly.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:13.740]   Well, this is the most depressing episode of Twitter we've ever done.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.100]   The world is going to hell in a hand, Bassett.
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:17.100]   >> Down, out.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.100]   >> Audio sucks.
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.100]   Politicians are corrupt.
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.100]   >> And we've got the internet.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.100]   >> It's a bitches.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.100]   >> It's a bitches.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.660]   >> It's a role-distracted and happy.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.500]   >> But at least we're distracted and happy.
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.500]   That's it, Patrick Norton.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.700]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:29.700]   >> The option works.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:30.700]   >> I want to thank you all for being here.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.420]   John C. Devorak is online at devorak.org/blog.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:36.220]   And if you don't know that, by now, shame on you.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.780]   The best place to go to get all your crap.
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.780]   >> Check it out.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.060]   >> Patrick Norton is unemployed, but ready to have a baby?
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.340]   We congratulate you, Patrick.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.340]   That's such great news.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.340]   >> Thank you.
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:46.340]   Thank you very much.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.340]   >> Actually, start with your job on Monday.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.340]   >> Oh, yes.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.340]   >> Very exciting.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.140]   >> And what job will that be?
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:53.980]   >> Going to work for revision three.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.980]   >> Aha!
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:55.980]   >> What a shock.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.940]   The facts come out.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.540]   Thank you for giving us the scoop, Patrick.
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:00.980]   That's great.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:06.500]   So now it's Jim Latterback, Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Sarah Lane, Martin Sargent,
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.500]   David Prager.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.260]   It's practically tech TV.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.260]   >> Hardly.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.260]   >> Hardly.
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.260]   >> Hirement Center.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.300]   >> It's your folks home for tech TVers.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.300]   Hey, that's great.
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.260]   What are you going to do on revision three?
[00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.420]   >> Oh, you know, making content.
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.180]   >> You know that new shows?
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:25.700]   >> Did you do a system which I've been working, David Randolph is amazing.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:27.740]   He's been doing a lot of projects.
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:32.940]   We're doing more, basically episode concentrated on a single project, going in depth on how
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.660]   to do something.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:40.100]   And that would be system.org, S-Y-S-T-M.org.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:43.420]   And then there's another show I'm going to be working on, but it looks like we're going
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.380]   to have to get a fresh new name for it.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.900]   >> Can you describe what it's going to be about anyway?
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:53.460]   >> Well, it's going to be about using technology and not getting your ass kicked by it.
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.660]   >> Sounds good to me.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:55.860]   Hey, that's great news.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.860]   I'm glad to hear it.
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.780]   I guess it's not a huge surprise, but I'm glad to hear it.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.820]   Instead of from the gossip columns to actually hear it here first.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.820]   Thank you, Patrick.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.820]   That's great.
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:06.820]   Congratulations.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.020]   Bill McCrone is writing everywhere.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.620]   Where's the best place to find you, Bill?
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:17.380]   >> Well, I'm pretty sporadic these days, but I mean, you can just Google me or something,
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:24.460]   but I guess my biggest project is the Wall Street Journal Holiday Gift Guide, which is going
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.220]   to be an enormous undertaking a little later this year.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.220]   >> That sounds exciting.
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.540]   Will that be on newsstands?
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.540]   >> That'll be in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.540]   >> That'll be in the Journal.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.540]   Okay, good.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.740]   >> And I imagine it'll have an online component and all of that stuff.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.020]   And it should be fun.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.540]   >> And there's always Bill's Best.com.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:48.620]   >> Well, yeah, that's the site that Ziff Davis froze 10 years ago, and I haven't been able
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.620]   to update it since.
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.260]   >> It's still got a Yahoo button on it.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.260]   I love it.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.460]   And McCrone.net, is that frozen?
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:02.180]   >> No, no, I don't ever update it, but it's still out there.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.100]   >> You and Patrick are going to have a blog.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.340]   >> I love it.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.620]   Anyway, we're so glad to have you back on, Bill.
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:09.620]   It's great to hear from you.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.620]   Don't be a stranger.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.620]   Always a pleasure.
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.620]   >> Thank you all for joining us.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.620]   Don't forget audible.com/twit.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.860]   A great place to find your favorite books, including books about Elvis.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.260]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.260]   We'll see you next time.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.260]   Another Twit.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.260]   >> This is amazing.
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.260]   >> This is in the can.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.260]   [MUSIC]
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:32.900]   >> You know, we still have cops in real talks.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:33.900]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.780]   >> Usually in Vegas or in New York or something like that.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.340]   >> And they have a similar show in Canada called To Protect and Serve.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.340]   >> Oh, I bet it's great.
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:47.220]   >> And the Canadian version of the show, I swear to God, is nothing more than a Canadian
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:52.020]   cop that's usually walking a beat, poking a drunk with a stick saying, "Get up, get
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.020]   up, go home."
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.020]   >> Get out of here.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.020]   >> Get out of here.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.020]   >> Go home.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.020]   >> Now go home.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:00.180]   >> We got a low speed chase going down Main Street.
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.180]   >> It's the whole show.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.020]   >> Bad boys, bad boys.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:15.020]   [MUSIC]
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.020]   >> All right.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.020]   >> Doin' the Twit, baby.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.020]   >> Doin' the Twit.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.020]   All right.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.020]   >> Doin' the Twit, baby.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.020]   >> Doin' the Twit.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.020]   All right.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.020]   >> Doin' the Twit, baby.
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.020]   >> Doin' the Twit.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.020]   All right.
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.020]   >> Doin' the Twit, baby.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.020]   >> All right.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.020]   >> Doin' the Twit, baby.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.020]   >> Let's go around.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.020]   [MUSIC]
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.020]   >> All right.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:41.020]   [MUSIC]
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:43.600]   (upbeat music)
