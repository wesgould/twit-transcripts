[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm calling this TWIT the beautiful edition because aside from myself we have some very attractive people
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   doing the show today starting with this guy over here Kevin Pereira, formerly of Attack of the Show on G4 TV.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   He's now at leeup.com.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Hey Kevin, good to see you.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Hey Leo, great to be on.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We have never met.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   No, we have not.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   But we bonded very quickly over cat videos and diamond.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And diamond Dave.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   We have that in common anyway.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Listen, I did not know what was going to go down so I brought a peace pipe just in case.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I also brought a handgun because you never know.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And so far nothing Adam Curry hasn't already introduced.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   The flashlight, that's the first.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Adam did not ring a flashlight last time though.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   But I'm here and prepared for any outcome and it's nice to finally chat with you.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Also with us, we'll talk about the flag.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Also with us, the wonderful Sheerla Zar.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Good to have you from what's trending.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Congratulations on your Emmy nomination, Sheerla.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's always great to be on.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I need to come in person in studio.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I agree.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You're doing this again though.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Last time you were on you were a tube top.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's summertime.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And this time you framed at least we know you're dressed because last time people were pretty
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   convinced you were naked the whole show.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Well that's, you know, they need to just listen to my voice.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   They don't need anything.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   That's right.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's the reason.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   That's all about the voice.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That's the reasoning.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And also with us, Callie Lewis of geekbeat.tv.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Great to have you, Callie.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Great to be here.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   She's obviously not in studio either but it looks like you have an amazing studio audience today.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   We do.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Everybody, let's hear from the studio audience.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Let's just show you know how many.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   [applause]
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   They're all here for Kevin Pereira.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's very exciting.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And I am wearing my baseball cap.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   You may notice this with the P on it.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   You know why that is?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Because our kids from the Petal Luma League, Petal Luma League are going to the, are in the
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Little League World Series.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   They're the Western Regional Champions.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   They lost today but they won their first game so it's a double elimination.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So I'm just showing, I'm showing representing P town with my Petal Luma Leagues.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Petal Luma Little Leagues.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   That's hard to say.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   What is the lead up 2012 tour?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I'm at the website and I'm looking at this Kevin.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I have no idea.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It sounds like a money making scheme to cash in on the nerd culture.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   If you ask me, I wouldn't buy a ticket.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So it's like Lala Palooza for geeks?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.760]   Yeah, honestly, I love going to conventions and I find myself seeing the same groups of
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.600]   people at each convention and it was painful to me that we only got around to meeting each
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   other and seeing each other a handful of times a year.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.720]   So I wanted to take bits of CES, E3, Comic Con, potentially Coachella, sort of miniaturize
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.320]   it and put it under one roof for one night and that's what lead up is.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   Wow, this is ambition.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   This is ambition.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320]   This is ambition.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.440]   We're in Los Angeles and it was a blast.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.800]   We had over a thousand people come.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.800]   Wow.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.540]   We had Kevin Smith, Chris Hardwick, Doug Benson, Alex Albrecht, Felicia Day.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.480]   We did stunts and games and giveaways.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.520]   Epic Neil Time had somebody chow down on a 500,000 calorie burger.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   And then while all that's going on on stage, there's music and then in the crowd, there's
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.360]   video games and cosplay and photo booths and it's one big party.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   So that's what we're doing.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.520]   We're taking it to 10 cities.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.960]   Seattle, September 20th, Portland, the 21st, then Austin, Dallas.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.960]   They're going to be down your way, Kelly.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   Yes, I see you here in Dallas.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.640]   Come on out to the show.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.200]   Philly, DC, many others.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.440]   I'd extend to you if you want to come out for any shows.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.360]   I wouldn't go anywhere near this.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   It sounds dangerous.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.560]   Oh, it sounds like we check for a switchblade.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.760]   I mean, the worst you're going to get is a switchblade comb.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   Wow, that's wild.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.760]   I think that's as dangerous as the crowd is.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.920]   Is there music to or is it all, I mean, what?
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.280]   Yeah, Vijay Mike realm is joining us for this tour and I'm going to jam with him on
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.280]   stage.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.680]   He's doing a 40 minute set and I'll be playing drums.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.600]   So it'll be a weird VJ drum mashup.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.040]   But yeah, we have local DJs opening up in every city.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.920]   So if you want to come on out and just play cat remixes, you're welcome to.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.080]   We'll put some drums behind it.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.320]   Well, that's cool.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.560]   That is just awesome.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   Wow.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.960]   Boy, it puts me, it puts us to shame, doesn't it?
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.160]   Cheryl Azars, what's trending launches its new season tomorrow?
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.400]   Yes, live in daily.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400]   Wow.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.640]   And you're going to go daily again.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   That's great.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   Brain damaging, a bit brain matching, but yeah, we're going live in daily with YouTube.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.920]   So it's really exciting and are you one of them YouTube channels or something?
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.720]   Not part of that.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.640]   I should have PR around me for what I say here, but we're not part of that whole investment.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.040]   They had the $100 million investment, but we're partnering with them and it's we're
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.320]   going to be shifting to a bit more.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:30.240]   We're more broader, what's trending online and what we saw is it all came back to YouTube.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.440]   And so we're going to be like what MTV was for music videos.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.400]   We're going to be to YouTube and we're, you know, live daily.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.000]   It's going to be a 20 minute or so live show curating the top videos that are trending
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   on YouTube.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.440]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.920]   So watch today, including the stars behind those videos and the same mixture of, you know,
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.400]   web and social media influencers and celebrities and traditional stars as well on the show.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.080]   So it's going to be really fun and it's the beginning of our growth.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   I keep.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.760]   I keep expecting that somebody's going to do a talk soup for YouTube videos because that's
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760]   really that's the idea.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   That's Ray William Johnson.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.280]   Oh, he's already doing that.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.800]   Ray William, I mean, it's a clip show of crazy stuff on YouTube.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   So we're more trying to create what you really need to watch.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.080]   We're obviously entertaining and fun and informative and we're going to be doing Google
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.440]   Plus interactivity in it.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.600]   I'm going to have guest co-hosts.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.000]   Why Google Plus?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Why Google Plus?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Why Google Plus?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.040]   Well, I won't we like it because, you know, for our switcher and what we have, our capabilities,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.760]   bringing in Skype for every single person.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.080]   If we want to have three or five people in a live chat, I mean, I don't know how you
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.440]   do it with your tech right now, but we were having to call one person up and then, you
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.520]   know, say goodbye to them and bring the next person up, whereas this allows us to bring
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.320]   in everyone at once.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   Got it.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   So you just hangouts.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.960]   Yeah, it's a hangout, but we're bringing it into our live stream.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   Got it.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.480]   So we'll be doing a global Google Plus hangout tomorrow with YouTube stars from around
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   the world.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.760]   We have a star in Peru who does the cute and fail in Peru.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.240]   We have a star in Hong Kong who has like over a million subscribers over there.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.760]   Beauty channel will have this YouTuber Olga Can Studio and will a DC.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.920]   It's a whole other world, but as you know, just the ecosystem is becoming more mainstream
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.840]   than it just it is where the media is.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.440]   It's not about either being a techie or a YouTuber.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.080]   It's like you need to be there to connect with people.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.720]   Callie Lewis is also here.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.160]   Callie, I feel left out.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.640]   I don't have anything big that you got anything big and huge going on exciting.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.720]   You're wearing bone conducting headphones.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   That's exciting.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   Right.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   Well, always testing new gadgets.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   That's my job.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.800]   But yeah, we've we've just been increasing a lot of what we're doing and putting more
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   out there.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.080]   We've also been working a lot with conferences, technology conferences.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.000]   It's been her official media street partner and go out there and do a lot of coverage
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.640]   from those from those events like in September, photo pluses coming up.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.400]   So all photographers, Geekbeat is teaming up with Frodo's photo, Jared Polin.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.360]   And we're going to be live streaming from that event and doing a lot of great coverage
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   from there.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   It's not September.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   It's October.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.560]   But I knew that was coming up too soon.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.960]   But yeah, we've been doing a lot of that and it's it's been fantastic.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.680]   So one of the things that we're just going to act about Google plus sure is because Twitter,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.000]   of course, getting a lot of attention this week by changing their API.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.040]   I'm just wondering if that's an opportunity for some of these other social networks to
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.160]   take up some of the slack.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.960]   Twitter is essentially saying to developers, thanks guys.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960]   Thanks for all the fish.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.200]   See you later.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.360]   A few developers, I think probably mostly developers who want to stay on Twitter is
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.520]   a good side of saying, oh, it's not all that bad.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.920]   But a lot of developers are saying, this is it.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.680]   There's no place to be a third party anymore.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.480]   Twitter really wants everybody to use Twitter's apps and Twitter's pages.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.000]   And of course, it's all about ads on Twitter.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.320]   Does that make any different share or does the user community on Twitter even know or
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   care about this?
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   Well, yeah, they do.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.480]   They've created a whole new economy with all the third party apps.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:23.040]   I mean, people have gotten acquired and made millions of dollars because of their ability
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.200]   to connect with the API.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.280]   And I think we're going to see a lot of businesses that are going to have to shut down because
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.280]   of it.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.760]   You're going to have a user cap.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.400]   You're just changing the whole system.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   The reason people love Twitter is because it was an open platform.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.720]   But obviously with the business angle of it all and advertising, the realizing they want
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.920]   people just to stay there.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.320]   They don't want people going to the third party apps.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.120]   And yeah, Twitter was the only one that did it.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.280]   You Google, obviously, people stay within the Google ecosystem and within YouTube.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.040]   Yeah, because Google doesn't really have an API.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.480]   You can't really build Google+ clients.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.400]   They maybe looked at Twitter and said, well, that was a mistake.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.360]   Although from an old timers point of view, it looked like that's what made Twitter a
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.360]   success.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   I was the smartest.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   There's no way that was a mistake.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   What?
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   What?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   What?
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   Not having an API?
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   No, to have an API.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   That's what brought everybody there.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   And this is Twitter's move to squeeze play.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   Everybody.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.680]   And it's our set based off our approval.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.480]   I mean, you can get to 100,000 or go to 200,000 if you're being grandfathered in or whatever
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.480]   the percentage is.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.120]   But it's up to their approval.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   So that's their squeeze play.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.280]   You'll either play to play them or they'll just acquire you or they'll see what's successful
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.040]   and just build it themselves in house.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:38.480]   They're saying if you're a new to upset about all of this, I mean, yes, it has great roots.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.200]   And it has that open feel from their roots.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.040]   But speaking as a business owner myself, I mean, you have to look at this decision from
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.520]   a business perspective because that's what it is.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.200]   They can't just do the same thing that they always have been.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   Sometimes you have to grow and you have to change.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.600]   And you know, if you love Twitter, you want them to stay in business that is an expensive
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.440]   proposition to run it like they always have.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.040]   So yeah, they do want people to use their ecosystem.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.480]   They do want people to pull in.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.400]   But it's not just using the Twitter website or apps.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.200]   You know, there are official apps that people can use.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   And to be honest, I think that the people who really care that it is an open platform
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.640]   essentially or has been are all on Twitter.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.760]   So people coming in new, I don't know that they're really going to have a problem with
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.160]   using the Twitter app on the iPhone or Twitter.com on their, you know, on the website.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.160]   I don't know.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   I have a problem.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.120]   Because I, to tweet, I use tap bots for instance, which is so much better than the official
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.320]   Twitter app.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.440]   Do you use the official Twitter app everywhere?
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.760]   I use the Twitter app on my iPhone.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   I use TweetDeck on the desktop.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.560]   TweetDeck is by the way owned by Twitter now.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.560]   Exactly.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.560]   But they haven't really been updating it.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.560]   I can use it for forever.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.760]   They haven't really updated it though, have they?
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.200]   No, it's still, there are things I don't like about it.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.280]   I mean, it's still very heavy for sure.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.520]   And they've done a couple of updates, I think.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.440]   TapBots, which I think is the best client on iOS anyway, iPad and iPhone, says, "Don't
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   panic."
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.720]   They say it's not as bad as it sounds.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.120]   We're going to continue with our development on the desktop.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.800]   They have been planning to put out TweetBot for a while on the desktop.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.920]   Now they're in a different position because they're grandfathered in, as you said, Kevin.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.640]   If you're a new Twitter client, you have to stop at 100,000 users unless Twitter says
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.240]   you can have more.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.680]   This could discourage innovation for developers when it comes to Twitter.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.440]   This could give rise to a competitor.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.240]   Someone's actually trying to kickstart a paid Twitter-like service that would promise to
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.240]   be ad-free and have a video.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.400]   Yeah, I'm using that app.net, which I love.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:56.640]   But it's 50 bucks to join, which is obviously not going to keep it from going mainstream.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   It could.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   Certainly.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.840]   Twitter could also say, "Listen, for these app developers, if they want to open it up,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.080]   the app developers could kick the cost to their users.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.480]   If you want to be on this piece of software, pay X amount of dollars, we'll use that to
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.400]   pay Twitter to allow you in."
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.400]   That could happen.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.200]   Twitter could squeeze it for multiple directions.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   We have to drop.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.400]   Yeah, I think that's going to have to happen because people, as they reach their limits,
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.880]   third-party applications are not going to be able to rely on advertising revenue for
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:30.480]   themselves because there will only be so many users that they can sell.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.400]   They can't rely on that increasing ad revenue.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.200]   They will have to absolutely charge people to use their service.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.000]   Why would you want to build your business on something that you know there's a cap on?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Right.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.440]   Well, there's always a risk of building your business on something like this, on somebody
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   else's business.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   Right.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.880]   I think people are learning that lesson and maybe they're not going to be as anxious to
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.880]   do that.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.040]   It's the same thing when you build your business on Facebook, isn't it?
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.880]   If they change their rules, you got no recourse.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.280]   I mean, any e-commerce or the iPad.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.840]   I guess you're right.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.840]   I guess if you're...
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.040]   So I did this thing.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.080]   Do you know about status people?
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.760]   Fakers.statuspeople.com.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:22.040]   This is an interesting thing.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.640]   I found out that 19% of my Twitter followers are fake.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.320]   I think you guys should all do this.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.640]   How much spam and junk there is.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.640]   Now I'm logged in as Wasted Leo.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.120]   The good news is Wasted Leo, which is a different account.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.320]   That's for when I'm drunk tweeting.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.600]   He's only 6% fake.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   But let me just show you the...
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.800]   That's the more relevant one.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   That's the one you should follow because there's fewer fakers on there.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:58.160]   But Leo Laport is now 22% fake followers, 42% inactive followers.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.360]   Only about a third of my followers are active.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   According to this...
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   How do they determine fake?
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.840]   Well, they're not super specific, but the implication is if it's somebody that has an
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.600]   egg for the profile, hasn't tweeted much, doesn't have many followers themselves.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.040]   Although that's deceptive because the way these spammers...
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.560]   You know you can buy followers on eBay, right?
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.680]   I've known people that have actually used services that artificially inflate your Twitter
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.200]   account so that they can get deals on hotels and get free goods from companies.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   For cloud.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.720]   They say, "Look, I've got 100,000 Twitter followers.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.840]   They're all completely fake, but some people just look at the number that's their metric
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.840]   and there you go."
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.720]   Well, I'm sure people are doing that now to get deals in general.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.200]   That's what they're using it for.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   Yeah, they're saying, "Hey, hotel, I'll come out and keep that."
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.760]   But you guys work in Hollywood.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.920]   I've heard stories that casting agencies will say, "Well, how many Twitter followers do
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   you have?"
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.080]   And they consider that now.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.560]   Well, they make that and they see it.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.080]   When I pitch shows, people want in the deck, whether I'm pitching a project for a media
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.320]   company or a viral campaign or an actual television show, within the deck, people want to know
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.120]   the social outreach of all the parties involved.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.960]   Like you have to have a slide that shows your Twitter outreach because that's now important.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.600]   And what's really important is that Twitter doesn't care.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.000]   It's as good for Twitter.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.280]   So here in Absolute Public, here's a site, www.EnterTwitter.com by 1,000 followers for
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.840]   14 bucks delivery within three days.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.080]   5,000 followers, 43 bucks.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   These are fake followers.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.840]   You want 100,000 followers?
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.840]   That could make a big difference.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.840]   Somebody has 100,000 followers.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   That's under 500 bucks.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.600]   It's worth a while if you have a business and you show that you just go to your Twitter,
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   right?
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.120]   And you show that you have 1000 followers, it shows that you're irrelevant, right?
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.840]   So I'm just saying that this is starting to add up to look less and less good for Twitter.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.440]   I guess real people don't care.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.160]   I guess Fiddy Cent doesn't care.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.000]   And the people who use Lady Gaga doesn't...
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.280]   He needs to hyperinflate the stock price before he can short sell.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.280]   Right.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.280]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.280]   That's Twitter.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.480]   By the way, Twitter worked really well for him, didn't it?
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.680]   I'll be very interested to see as the market moves from...
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:04.560]   As Hollywood as you point out, moves from seeing just numbers to actual influence.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.000]   Because as we all know, people with varying degrees of numbers have varying degrees of
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.400]   influence or actual interaction from their audience.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.160]   But who's going to determine that?
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   I think that's the next step.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.160]   Is it cloud?
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.160]   Well, we'll do use the credits.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.680]   It'll be cloud-free, cloud-like service.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   Sure.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.920]   If you look at Justin Bieber recently celebrated his latest album, I believe it went platinum,
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.280]   which is, I think, is that a million purchasers or something of that nature?
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.280]   See, that's real, right?
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.560]   You don't have fake buyers.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.080]   Well, but that is a very small fraction of a percentage of his Twitter followers.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.080]   Is that interesting?
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.440]   If you look at it that way, it's like, you know, a 4% engagement or something like that.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.880]   Now, these numbers I'm completely scattershot on because I don't follow Bieber as closely
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   as I should.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.880]   Well, how many...
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.880]   Does he have that many followers?
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   It's a cancer flaw.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.880]   How can you not?
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.880]   I have his...
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   I'm subscribed to his SMS tweets.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.880]   Are you?
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.880]   You get him on your phone?
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.880]   No.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   The bees?
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   Hey, I just got a text from the bebs.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.360]   Remember, there was a story ages ago about Twitter having dedicated servers and stuff
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.200]   to manage just Bieber's outreach because so many people were looking for alerts with
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   them.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   That's amazing.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.200]   The Bieber server.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.280]   But there's a raxome place with just a bad lesbian comb over and it's the Bieber net
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.000]   system just sitting there, just managing him.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   That's amazing.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Sure.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   What were you going to say?
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I've seen a single Twitter audit.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.840]   I feel like all these things came out in the past week.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.840]   No.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   Is this the same idea?
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.840]   It's like the same...
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.320]   Yeah, it literally came out actually created by a fellow Montrealer.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   So check it out.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.320]   I'm going to do my...
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   I'm going to take my Twitter audit.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.240]   Yeah, see, it's the same the way they go through the names.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.800]   See if that other site does it the same?
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.480]   Yeah, see if I get the same.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.800]   I'm trying to find the site.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   Twitter audit.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.360]   How many of your followers are real?
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   It's very odd.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.360]   All right.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   Let's see.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.080]   By the way, if you guys aren't following Horse_Ebooks, he is the single greatest Twitter
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   stamp bot.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.560]   You know about Horse ebooks?
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.560]   Oh my God.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.640]   I put him on attack of the show a while back and we actually had a character come out
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.280]   in a Horsehead with a cigar and read the tweets.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.720]   It was a terrible bit, but damn if those aren't hilarious tweets.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   So this is a...
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   This is apparently a...
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   I don't...
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   We don't even know what it is.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   They're a publisher of Horsebooks.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   No, no, no, no.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.000]   It's a complete like Ukrainian spam bot.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.480]   Like someone did the research on it.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   Oh, they're not real?
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.480]   No.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480]   Not at all.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.200]   It's completely random prose in their tweets.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   That doesn't...
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.440]   Yeah, it's a piece of software goes out, crawls the web, pulls out random sentences and what
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.480]   not and then tries to pass itself as human.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.560]   Oh, what's the point?
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.520]   To get followers so that they can do sponsored tweets.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.920]   So eventually you will see in their timeline tweets that have URLs.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.360]   Look at these, closed open, closed open, closed open, closed open.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.520]   I love trout fishing sounds.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.600]   Crammed with scrumptious.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.600]   Are you looking for...
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.960]   I have a t-shirt with one that just says the rock hard thighs of a God.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.440]   Which was one of the random Horsebooks tweets.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.480]   Now most of these don't have links, but some of them do.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.480]   So maybe the idea is...
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.920]   Well this is an interesting way to play on an internet meme.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.800]   We've got 95,000 followers, mostly people like you, Kevin, who think it's hysterical.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.320]   Yeah, it's absolutely great.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.400]   I mean most of my followers get angry whenever I retweet Horsey books.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.560]   The ones who get it are my favorite.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.040]   One tweet here, the 13th of August.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.000]   The decline and fall of the first Italian.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.160]   The hell does that mean?
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   It's brilliant.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.920]   Guaranteed roof or oatmeal muffins.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   So great.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   So great.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   But cruise ship career.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.640]   But you're playing right into this by retweeting them.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.640]   What am I playing into?
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.640]   I don't know.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.800]   I have a piece of software that's going out there and crawling the net.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   I know what it is.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   I think it's hilarious.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.680]   I love that a piece of software can have more interesting tweets than Taylor Swift.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.160]   It's totally non-sequitur.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.640]   You are all into the celebrity tweet or something.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   I like Taylor Swift.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   I'm so pumped.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.640]   I'm so pumped.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   She's great on Instagram though because you see pictures of her house, her bed, her
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640]   TV or cats.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640]   Her cats.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   That doesn't sound remotely creepy the other way.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.640]   I just feel like...
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640]   I know the way he was saying it even.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.640]   He's fantastic.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640]   He's good.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.640]   He's good.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.640]   He's good.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   He could drive by her place on street view and look through her blinds.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.960]   She leaves him wide open and she's tanning.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.280]   She did a livestream on YouTube recently and the engagement factor was interesting because
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.520]   she has what a few million followers.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.200]   And she had 30,000 people watching live which is pretty incredible for this announcement.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.960]   But if you think about the percentage of people that are actively engaged versus the
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.000]   people following her, that's nothing, right?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.720]   Well, I think that's one of the points we're making and clearly with the Bieber sales,
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.480]   that's one of the points that you're making, Kevin, is that this proves that these Twitter
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.880]   numbers are grotesquely inflated.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.040]   There's quantity and there's quality just like there's always been with everything that's
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.480]   quantifiable.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.640]   And I think people are starting to realize now that having 5 million Twitter followers
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.720]   is not nearly as interesting as having 100,000 hyper-engaged followers.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.960]   And once the services figure out how to measure that properly and one rises to the top,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.560]   then it'll get better for businesses across the board.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.200]   Or not.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.600]   So what do we do about Twitter?
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.080]   Do we ignore the new API?
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.600]   Oh, I'm going to do my Twitter audit.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600]   Let me just see.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.440]   I was going to see.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.960]   So according to Twitter audit, they're analyzing right now my follower.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   Oh, it takes a while.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.600]   It's going to be done in two hours.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   Two hours.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.600]   It's going to take--
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.240]   I expect some seriously good results.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.640]   I'm in the queue, boy.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.920]   Deep Blue is crunching away on it right now.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   It's beautiful.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.920]   It shouldn't be that hard.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.000]   I mean, I can understand why it's taking time because it has to go through each follower
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.640]   and say, well, do they tweet?
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640]   Do they have followers?
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.480]   Do they have a profile picture?
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.520]   Does their profile picture a porn star?
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   I mean, they--
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.680]   I wonder if that two hour limit is because the API is actually limiting how many calls
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.920]   they can make against your profile because they only do so many per hour.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   It could be.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.560]   So they do it similarly to the other one where they take a sample.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.800]   In this case, a 5,000 person sample followers sample.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.000]   And they base to score a number of tweets, data the last tweet, and ratio followers to
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   friends.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.880]   I don't know how perfect that is.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.600]   But I'll be very curious to see if it comes out compared to the other one.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   It's by Dave--
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   Well, I'm a blindfold.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   Dave C. and Gross Nasty.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   Right.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   I think--
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.600]   Right.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   --the guns of yours, Shira.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600]   I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.840]   I just think along those lines, what's fascinating to me is Twitter sentiment engines right now.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.360]   To me, that's a very hot space because it's one thing to do a search and say, oh, look,
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.120]   people talked about cold case.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.600]   20 million people are talking about it.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   But what are they saying?
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.080]   Are they saying something that's good or bad?
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.080]   I'll tell you what they're saying.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.080]   Yeah!
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.680]   That's the time of day.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.960]   That's what they're saying.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.960]   That's what they're saying.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   All right.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:40.640]   Well, I mean, that's the same question that Facebook has with on their hands when they
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.840]   let anybody be saying anything about a page that they like to show up on that profile.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   Ah.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.160]   We can talk about that because they got to find, isn't they?
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.760]   Are you talking about the ads that they were doing?
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   No, no.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:26:00.000]   A while back, how pages can automatically show--
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Oh, your interest.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.560]   --what everybody is saying about that.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.560]   Right.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.560]   I forget what they called it.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:12.360]   But that's the same kind of concept that we have this issue of, OK, yeah, they may be
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   talking about it.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.040]   But what are they actually saying?
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   Right.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   And Facebook's--
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.280]   It's not enough merely to say they're talking about it.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.240]   They could be saying how much they hate it.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.240]   Right.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.880]   Unless you subscribe to the All Press is good.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.040]   Well, maybe it is.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.640]   Yeah, I feel like the internet's sort of eroded that a little bit.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.040]   I feel like that they equaled the playing field a little bit for negative press.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.520]   I feel like that could be equally damaging to a brand.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520]   Oh, totally.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   Completely.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.760]   And it has-- I mean, United Breaks guitars.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.760]   There are stories--
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.760]   Right, right.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.760]   --the stories that we all talk about on a daily basis where exactly your point, Kevin, is
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   pretty--
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   You have three of you have brands.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:55.600]   Isn't it a little scary that how easy it would be for somebody to tarnish your brand?
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   Kind of--
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   Is that a threat?
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.120]   I don't mean taint your brand.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   Just tarnish it.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   My brand has been so tarnished and taintred already.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.120]   The other guy knows that.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.920]   It is a little bit scary, though, isn't it?
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.080]   That-- you know, it's hard to control this.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.680]   You have the ability to talk back, but this stuff gets a life of its own.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.440]   Yeah, of course it's scary.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.440]   And there are that potentials out there.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:24.600]   But in all of our cases, we have the-- we have a bit more ability to control it, whereas
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.560]   large, huge companies, Fortune 500 companies or whatever, they have less of the ability
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.560]   to control that.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   Look what happened to Rick Santorum.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.080]   Now, I don't know if it hurt Rick Santorum or not.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.040]   But then you Google his name.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   Is that?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.160]   So I feel like if someone wants to troll you, like you can do anything these days.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.520]   And even if it's someone, you're like, oh, it's a troll.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.600]   It's someone that's from Midwest that lives in their parents basement.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.000]   There are nobody.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.920]   Nobody's can still have voices these days, and that can get scary too.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   Right.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920]   And if people--
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.920]   Here's a good example.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.920]   --play the game online, go with Reddit.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.360]   They can just totally troll you everywhere.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   Here's a good example.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.720]   Rocklon, our chat room reminded me of the comedian who said that his insurance company
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.960]   was paying for the defense of his mom's murderer, which turned out not to be true.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   But people--
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   That turned out to be true.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   --is the progressive auto insurance.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   I wasn't going to say the name, but yeah.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.040]   It's not true.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   It's not true.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.280]   It is the gist of it.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   Right.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.240]   But I don't want to bring it back to life.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.000]   But it just shows you that thing had life of its own that had a whole news cycle out
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   of itself.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.520]   I'll be honest though, the reason I asked you, because I didn't hear that it wasn't true.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.040]   And studies have shown that the further away you get from the root story when you're just
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.640]   looking at discussions or you're looking at comments and reactions, people tend to take
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.840]   it as truth because they assume the commentary is based off of a kernel of truth, a story
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.360]   that did fact-checking and everything else.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.280]   And even it has proven that that's not entirely true at all.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   Right.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   That was back to example--
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.280]   Yes, I can't.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.280]   Oh, sorry.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.000]   Take, for example, the day four story.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.800]   They published, they created the iPhone screw or the--
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.600]   Oh, that's a classic.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.040]   --that was quote unquote "creating."
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.880]   And just put a link on Reddit.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.560]   And next thing you know, everything has blown up and people are talking about it like it's
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560]   real.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.880]   And it was completely fake and contrived.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:26.000]   But that all tells us and what we're just talking about that you should put a little
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.640]   bit of thought into what you believe when you're reading something and then just take
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.800]   it and go.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.680]   I mean, it's something we all have as a habit, I think.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   That was quite the story.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:43.880]   Day four is a Swedish blog that published a fake image of an asymmetrical screw and all
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.640]   of the Apple rumor blogs picked it up and said, "Look, what apples?"
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.240]   Partly because they believed it, you know, that this is something Apple would do.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.880]   I think that's part of what this--
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.360]   It's like an urban myth, urban legend, right?
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.920]   It has to be credible in some way.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.080]   It has to tap into something.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.400]   Like, "Oh, you have course insurance company would pay to defend my mom's murderer."
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.880]   Of course that would happen.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.720]   Otherwise, it doesn't carry any weight.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.240]   It's a very-- I just find it a little scary and depressing.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   And I will--
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:18.920]   It also points to how like just an obsessive and sometimes pathetic need to constantly
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.560]   be craving new information about things like a new iPhone.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.720]   It is our fault, isn't it?
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   I mean, we all perpetuate it.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.720]   It is our fault.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   Yeah, it's not just a new iPhone.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.760]   When you have a blog that you're updating 24/7 and you want to report about something,
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.640]   you know, a lot of people want to say they're the first or they want to bring people the
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.760]   inside track to a story.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.520]   But that doesn't mean that it's real.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.720]   And then we definitely need to come up with some sort of way of sifting through all this
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.000]   information and figuring out what's credible and not credible.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.240]   You kind of got bit by bit.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   You kind of--
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.920]   A rumor or gossip becomes like, "Oh, that's like in the headline."
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   It's still a rumor, but it's enough a rumor that we need to report it, right?
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.520]   You kind of got bit by that, remember?
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.880]   I mean, that was terrible what happened.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.440]   Yeah, it was unfortunately an employee that decided to--
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.600]   This was before Steve--
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   No, you were five something.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.440]   Before Steve Jobs died, somebody tweeted on your account.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.560]   Unfortunately, it wasn't you I know that Steve Jobs was dead and people picked it up
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.000]   and then it turned out not to be true and it cost you dearly.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.200]   And less than a minute later, it was taken down.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:29.000]   And it was interesting that it was less than a minute later, but it was still a story that
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.960]   someone would have just tweeted that but then deleted it.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.440]   It wasn't even like it was a blog post, yeah.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:40.720]   But it really proved it was a lesson, a harsh lesson, that one, even a credible outlet,
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.880]   like Gizmo know all these sites that we look to for our tech information will post something,
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.520]   even though the person maybe who posted it said, "Sorry, this is not real."
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.520]   Didn't matter.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.360]   And yet, it's still a story.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.880]   It becomes real.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.880]   It becomes real.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.280]   Anyone's just trying to find any sort of story this day and age.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.800]   And the story that you posted it becomes the story.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.280]   That's the most ridiculous part.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.520]   It was at some point it's not even about the fact that that tweet was sent out.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.160]   It's about the fact that you deleted it and who sent it and why was it sent and what's
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   going to happen?
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   We're sick.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.160]   We are all sick.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.160]   It was nothing else going on.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.160]   We need a more high speed car chase.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.160]   It's like us weekly.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   Right.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:25.440]   It's like the community online is becoming these gossip magazines that we all used to
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.680]   put down and that's why this community emerged online because we hated all that stuff.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.440]   We were so anti-Hollywood and yet we're creating our own little mini Hollywood system here.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   I love it.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   We have the same way.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.000]   I mean, it goes back to news and gossip and tabloid.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Dear Leela Putsch, I got...
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Yeah, it happens everywhere.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   I am.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.440]   News, biochases, politics that happens in school yards.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.880]   It's human nature.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:55.880]   So like you were saying, Sherry, we got away from it to form the online community but because
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:01.600]   it's just the way we work as human beings, it's creeping back in.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.080]   You got to kind of keep a check on yourself, I think, every single person.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.760]   We're going to take a break.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.400]   I want to talk about the backlash to something like this.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:17.080]   Do people just start to give up, throw their hands up and dial out or do we love this trash
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.080]   so much?
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.760]   We wallow in it.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.240]   Kevin Pereira is here from Leet.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.240]   What is it?
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   Leetup?
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240]   Leetup?
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   Leetup.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   Leetup for creative.tv either one.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.600]   Oh yeah, and super creative.tv.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.600]   Let's not forget that.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.600]   Got it.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   Plug it all.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.640]   Former host of Attack of the Show, I'm going to ask you what happened there too because
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.240]   I know the world wants to know.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.240]   I think you've talked about it but I'm just going to...
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.080]   People in the chatroom are saying, ask Kevin about it.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.280]   I want to put this to bed, Leo.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   That's all I want to do.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   Put it to bed.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.000]   We just share a box of cupcakes.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.520]   You have a bed right behind you so you'll be ready to do that.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.520]   It'll be easy.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.520]   I do and I hate it for you.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.520]   Yeah, it's made.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   We like that.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.360]   The hardest part was kicking the fan girls out.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.160]   Then it's been coming back.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:05.120]   Well, we first started doing net cams on tech.tv.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.520]   We started taking calls for people.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.880]   Nobody had ever done that before.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.760]   I think people weren't thinking that, yeah, this is going to be...
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.960]   People are going to see what's behind you and never fleshlights and unmade bet.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.560]   Oh, wait a minute, never mind.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.720]   Callie Lewis is also here.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.320]   And sorry that she is.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.160]   And of course from Geekbeat.tv.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.040]   And of course, sure, Lazar.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.400]   What's trending that come more in a bit?
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.600]   But first a word from our friends.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.960]   It's Citrix, makers of the great go to my PC.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.440]   Summertime is a great time to get away from work.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.120]   But sometimes getting away from work is not the greatest thing.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.760]   How many times you come back to an inbox piled with mail?
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.760]   You wish...
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.200]   Maybe I can clear that out a little bit during the vacation.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.680]   Or maybe there's some important thing your boss says, "Hey, where's that PowerPoint?
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.760]   You've got to drive into work just to get the...
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.960]   Wouldn't it be great if you could access your office computer anytime, anywhere, from even
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.080]   from your iPad or your iPhone?
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.480]   That's what go to my PC makes possible.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.640]   Mac or PC, before you go on vacation, I want you to visit gotomyPC.com from your office
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   computer.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.640]   Install it.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.640]   You don't need IT help or anything.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.640]   It's very straightforward.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.920]   By the way, very secure.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   And now hit the road and you can access your computer anywhere, anytime, from any other
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.440]   computer or your iPhone or your iPad.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.280]   It's actually great on your iPad.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.840]   And there's some additional advantages to it because it means you could, for instance,
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.000]   somebody was saying, "Well, how do I run Flash on my iPhone or iPad?"
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.720]   Well, you can't, but you could with go to my PC, you run go to my PC, surf back to your
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.320]   office computer, and there you can see the Flash.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.760]   It lets you surf securely.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.160]   If you're in an open access spot and you're a little worried, you surf back to the office,
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.760]   surf from there.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   Lots of great uses for it.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.640]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.400]   The apps are free.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.880]   All you have to do is visit gotomyPC.com.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.920]   There's that orange try it free button right in the middle there.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.160]   Click that and use our offer code TWIT.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.320]   The great folks at Citrix, it uses NAT traversals.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.880]   You don't have to open ports on a firewall.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.880]   That's why it's secure.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.720]   It's also SSL, so it's 128-bit encrypted.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   That's why it's secure.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   Never been an exploit.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   It's safe.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   It's fast.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   It's effective.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.960]   You could do anything you could do at work, send and receive email, access any network
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.400]   resource running program.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.320]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.320]   Try it free.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.400]   Offer code is TWIT.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.360]   Do you ever think, "Shirless" are that people are just going to get through up their
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.960]   hands at some point and say, "The Internet is a cesspool.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.320]   I can't trust anything I read.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   I give up."
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.080]   There is a movement going on of actually disconnecting, right?
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.600]   There's a lot where people don't want to tweet anymore.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.920]   They don't want to Facebook.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.440]   They just want to create and put it out there.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.600]   If it does well, it does well.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.440]   In the instruction it does.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.600]   It's stopping so connected and tweeting stuff just for the sake of tweeting it.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.120]   I'm just annoyed at the journalists and some of these outlets and I'm not going to name
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:59.480]   names, but that continue to try to dig up things when just there's no story there.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.080]   That's where you find the blogs that are about the rumors and the gossip and, "Oh, it's
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.480]   not confirmed, but maybe."
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   That's not information.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.640]   That's not news and I'm so sick of journalists propagating that as news, right?
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.080]   Name some names, Shira.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.080]   Who are you?
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   I'm not going to take them down one by one.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   But even though they don't even need a journalist, put them on the tires.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.080]   It's not even a journalist.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.080]   These are blah.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   There's no way.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.760]   We don't have Valley Bag around anymore, right?
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.600]   We can't talk about who you're dating or I'm dating.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.960]   We still have Gawker, believe me.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.800]   If they want to publish something sleazy, which they have about me, they will do it anyway.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.600]   The thing is, you don't even need a journalist to spread information these days.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:42.040]   You can just have a Twitter person or a YouTube personality or any sort of online personality
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.160]   that has a following and has a voice and they can just start a story themselves.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.240]   Because they have some sort of reputation or credibility because of just how many people
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.480]   follow them, you listen.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.480]   You know what I think of?
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   I think of TV.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.160]   When TV first came out, everybody was saying, "This is going to change the world.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.640]   It's going to bring us together."
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.080]   Maybe why the Soviet Union fell because they saw the West and they saw freedom, I don't
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   know.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.600]   But it also brought a Gilligan's Island, I dream of a genie and a bunch of crap and
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:14.560]   in reality, a desperate housewife or the mafia mob boss wives of New Jersey or whatever it
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   is.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   Here comes Honey Boo Boo.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.560]   He's comes Honey Boo Boo.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.040]   And it didn't live up to its potential.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.760]   I'm a little worried that the internet, which really has the potential to change everything,
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.680]   it just ends up being just another junk fest.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.200]   I think it's, I mean look, TV managed to change a handful of things before it became
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.040]   all 16 in pregnant reruns.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.600]   You know, and I think we're seeing that with the internet from Arab Springs to other uprising
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   that it's getting.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   Exactly.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   And I hate to lose that.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   I hate to lose that.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.400]   But that exists and that's a slight gooey center surrounded by just chocolate BS, which
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.320]   yes, you have to nibble through to get to it.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.320]   Well, that worries me actually because on YouTube you see shows that work that have
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.320]   huge followings and viewership.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.600]   And I think media is trying to figure out the examples of success right now.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.600]   And those are the case studies.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.360]   And so everyone's like, well, that means that's the future of content.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.440]   We're going to see annoying oranges up the wazoo.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.960]   All different fruits of faces.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.160]   No, seriously, I guarantee you you'll see that on all the major networks, you'll see clones
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.720]   of epic mealtime, annoying orange, all of the, all of the success.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.680]   We don't happen because the people that are creating them don't want to get into those
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.640]   contracts because networks can't pay them enough because they will sign their.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.920]   You're kidding, really?
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.080]   There's more money being a YouTube star than on the networks.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.560]   There's more money in owning your property and have, you know, thinking long term and
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.320]   big with what you've created instead of being with a bad contract.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.960]   I hope that that's the case.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.160]   I think it depends on the property entirely.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.520]   But what I what's really fascinating is not to me, Leo, not so much that you'll see the
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.960]   rip offs of epic mealtime, but the notion of that in five years time, which is a shame
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.520]   because it should be today, you will have that delivered on your TV and it will feel
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.520]   just the same as a network program.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.320]   Really, you think that's a shame with epic mealtime is not yet on TV?
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.680]   I think it's a shame that, I think it's a shame that cable operators have been so restrictive
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.760]   like the way that they retaliated against Google TV and the Comcasts of the world and
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.960]   the Biocom stopped their streaming because the experience was too good.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.520]   They should be able to compete with the same things.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.880]   And there's something to be said for epic mealtime being way better than some of the
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   trash that's on TV.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.240]   They want to control it.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.400]   And I think you're right, sure that the creators say, no, why should we even consider that?
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.440]   Well, because they look at themselves as the next channels.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.920]   So epic mealtime, I don't know, it depends on the brand, but they could create their
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.880]   own app so that the future TVs instead of flipping through a channel, you're flipping
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.800]   through apps and they're one of the most popular apps because of brand recognition and they're
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   following.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   Right.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:50.200]   And I think when the future, we're going to have still the networks that we have loyalty
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:56.280]   to and they're familiar to the viewers, but you're going to have the brands that we're
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.800]   seeing being created on YouTube and different digital platforms that are going to end up
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.560]   becoming the future channels and networks.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.800]   And we're already seeing it.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:09.640]   Well, that's segues us to this story about Apple trying to woo cable operators into piping
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.680]   their content through Apple TV.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.840]   This comes from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.120]   Apple is in touch with cable operators.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.760]   What they really want, I guess, is what you were talking about.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.960]   Kevin is access to cable content on your Apple TV.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.120]   Over the top box, everybody's fighting to be that last device that delivers a signal
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.480]   to the television so they can overlay their experience and their ads and wall their garden
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.360]   and charge you for their experience.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.400]   It's going to get really, really muddled for consumers in the next few years when you have
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.120]   to, I mean, already, if I want to legally watch a piece of content, I have to check 15 different
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.520]   services from Apple, to Xbox, to Sony, to iTunes, to Amazon.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.520]   And it may not even be there.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.160]   So then I just go to my trusty torrent site.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.160]   Right.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.440]   And there it is in every version, every flavor and high def.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.240]   It's going to get worse before it gets better.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.880]   I think it's going to come down to the Apple, Google, Comcast and Viacom's of the world.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:07.680]   Well, I think if they can achieve this Apple rather than doing the Apple TV, the TV itself,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:12.640]   I think if they can put this in a set top box, essentially, and get the cable providers
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.040]   to work with them, which is going to be really tricky.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:23.280]   But the fact of combining traditional TV and the online content is ideal in all worlds,
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   for sure.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:29.920]   And I think that the cable operators, they certainly need to take another look.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.560]   I mean, the amount of cable cutters are on the rise.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:39.920]   But let's say we have the Apple TV and you have both your online content like you do
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:47.160]   now, as well as the traditional TV sources, those cable cutters, because who wants a half
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.560]   working device, right?
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.400]   Those cable cutters could actually turn the cable back on and start paying for that content
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   again.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.040]   So I think it'd be ideal for them to work with Apple on this, for sure.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.160]   It's an interesting balancing act that Apple is trying to do because on the one hand, I
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.560]   think they want the well, perfect example, Game of Thrones.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:11.640]   You can't buy Game of Thrones until a year after it's on HBO because HBO is very restrictive.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:17.440]   I think you're right that the stick that Apple can shake at cable operators is, well, you're
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.040]   just going to bit torrent it.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.520]   They're just people are just going to steal it if you don't make it available.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520]   They can't buy it.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.320]   But then on the other hand, these cable operators also realize Apple wants to bring original
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:32.680]   content, like the stuff sure does, to the television set, disintermediating the cable
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.480]   operators and making an effect.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.040]   Apple be the channel for content.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.560]   It's going to be very competitive.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.160]   I mean, Apple's trying to play both sides, aren't they?
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.800]   Yeah, and you're going to see everyone.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.320]   I mean, I think I look at YouTube with the premium channels that they launched.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.800]   And I look at that as a place.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.240]   So in the Google TV comms, you'll have something besides for the advertisers that is premium
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.400]   and that is the future series that you would otherwise, you know, maybe would have watched
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.000]   in the past on a cable network, but it's going to become very competitive.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.160]   I see them pinning people against each other besides the actual cable networks and traditional
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   networks.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:10.920]   The need for original, like what Netflix is doing with the rest of development, everyone's
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.200]   going to be finding like, what is that original series?
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.640]   Like, oh, you're on Google.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.600]   Well, you can't be on Apple then.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.000]   It's going to get very dirty.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Very messy.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.400]   Yeah, I mean, look, it's the age old saying that content is king and everybody's realizing
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.920]   that yet again in this new brave era.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.200]   And so that's why Apple is going the licensing route where to Leo's point, they have to play
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.400]   nice to get the content and then eventually they can start clamping down charging what
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   they want.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.440]   Google is going original programming with YouTube as well as agreements, Netflix, clearly as
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.080]   they're watching all of these content providers pull their libraries from their streaming service.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.520]   They're saying, Oh, wait a minute, maybe we need to fund some original content.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:52.160]   They're all going to say content is king and certainly, you know, Comcast bought NBC
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.040]   because they believed content was important.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.760]   But I think ultimately the companies that provide the big fat pipes into our houses think
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.080]   they're the king.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.680]   They think, well, you know, look at the battle between Viacom and is it dish where dish says,
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.320]   Hey, look, we're the gatekeeper.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:14.440]   We don't have to let you into that guy's house unless you give us enough money and they don't.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.040]   And that's where the battle is going to rage.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   Is it not?
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   They're all going to say I thought it.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   I'm sorry, sure.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.000]   What was interesting about that whole debacle was I thought for sure this would be a light
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.920]   lightning rod for Viacom to say, you know what, forget it.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.400]   Clearly users are seeking a chance.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   They can't get.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.080]   We're going to put up the pay gate, give us 99 cents a month or five 99 a month and you
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.080]   got it online.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.360]   And what they did instead was shut down their online streaming of mini programs, which doesn't
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.520]   make any sense to me.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   I don't understand because the deal is there.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.400]   I think they're scared of going it alone right now.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.520]   They're scared of consumers paying directly and they make a lot of money off direct TV.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:53.200]   They said get more complaints if people couldn't watch Colbert on the internet or anyway.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.440]   So they'd say, Hey, I can't watch Colbert at all.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.760]   You got to put it back on.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.760]   Correct.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.480]   And I think that, you know, make no mistake about it.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.040]   Everybody realizes this is the future set top box.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.280]   You're holding up the iPhone.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.840]   You're saying so any portable device is really any smartphone that has high speed internet.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.960]   There's no reason you can't deal in a play.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.200]   Here you go.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.560]   And it's all available here.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.760]   I mean, this will be it.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   We got a demo.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.000]   We'll show it on iPad today on Thursday.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.040]   We got a demo of area, which is Barry Diller's company in New York City only right now.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.480]   They won the court case against them.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.000]   Cable companies trying to put them out of business.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.720]   So it looks like they'll be everywhere.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.760]   What you do they have, they figured out a way to make dime sized antennas and they put
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.560]   hundreds of them on a card and they put thousands of them in a box that receive the over the
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.400]   air signals in New York City.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   And then you as a subscriber and it's $80 a year, by the way, as a subscriber get the
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.800]   whatever's coming into that antenna on your iPad.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.440]   They have built in DVR capability.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.600]   So now you have the over the air signal and you don't have a cable company.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.960]   You don't have a satellite.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.580]   You just have this little online service called area.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:01.160]   And the reason they want to court is because the judge said, took, believed them when they
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.680]   said, well, all we're doing is running them an antenna.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.920]   This is a one to one thing.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.920]   You've got an antenna.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.560]   It's piping it into your internet access.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.120]   That's all we're doing.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.560]   They're going to do that nationwide.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.800]   I think that's interesting.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:18.600]   But Wall Street Journal also says that Apple intends, and this I think will be very compelling
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.360]   and I'm curious what our audience thinks of this in their set top box to erase the distinction
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.680]   between live and on demand.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.120]   Basically, you just pick the show you want to watch.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.640]   And even if it just started a minute ago, you can watch it now.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.560]   You just want you watch whatever you want to watch whenever you want to watch it.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.840]   I mean, yeah, isn't that isn't that a logical conclusion when everything can be digitized
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.840]   and held on a server?
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.680]   Like, why wouldn't you be able to start it at some point?
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.120]   It's not it's never been a technical limitation.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.880]   It's always been a monetary one.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.520]   It's been these guys holding back trying to restrict viewing, trying to get better licensing
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   agreements.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.920]   We've had the I mean, look at replay TV.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.440]   We've had the technology to do amazing things with shifting our viewing habits and getting
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.680]   it all around on different screens and broadcasting wirelessly.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.120]   We've had that technology for years and years and years and years.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.280]   It's not a technological issue.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.080]   It's a monetary one.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.320]   Maybe Apple's the one company that could pull everybody together.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.320]   Go ahead.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.320]   Kelly, go ahead.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   No, sorry.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:21.680]   That's the generations of these cable companies move along and people retire and new generations
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.520]   come up that these things will get easier.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.920]   But that's still going to take a long time.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.600]   And I think like she was saying, it will get pretty nasty.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.520]   And then we'll see it settle.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.360]   But I still think it's going to take a long time and that's we're just going to have
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.080]   to live through it, unfortunately.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.640]   Do any of you guys have HBO go?
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   I've been loving it.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:53.720]   It's an amazing streaming service and I rather buy the HBO go than just buy cable to get
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   HBO.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.720]   You have to have cable to get HBO.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.720]   Yeah, but that's the thing.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.000]   Well, yeah, I guess I take it.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   It's so easy though to take someone else's username and password.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.200]   You just have a friend that gives it to you.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   Sheer a lazzar.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   You are a bad person.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.640]   I gave it to you.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.640]   They wanted to get it to me.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.840]   Oh, so when you said does anybody have HBO go?
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   You meant is anybody stealing HBO go?
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.840]   I just use it.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.400]   You put your names and passwords.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   How many?
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.400]   It's so easy.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   How hard are you going to be?
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.400]   Do you want to?
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   You want to get asked for this?
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.400]   Maybe some information.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:28.800]   So they would have had an extra user for me if I could do it without getting it through,
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.760]   you know, a typical TV contract.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.920]   I would have just bought HBO go for I saw you saw the online petition HBO.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.920]   Let me let me give you money.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:42.000]   And thousands of people, tens of thousands people said, yeah, I'll pay HBO 50 bucks or
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   whatever, 15 a month.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.040]   HBO said, no, not going to happen.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.040]   You know why?
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:54.360]   Because it would be because dish, direct TV, Comcast would all say, buy by HBO.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.720]   And right now they got affiliate agreements.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.080]   Sorry, they've got affiliate agreements that say they can't do that.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.080]   Exactly.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.240]   So it's going to be years before they can do that.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.320]   It's not that HBO might not want to do that today.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.320]   They can't.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   They're probably chomping at the top of the contract.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   They can't.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.320]   They can't.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.080]   They got in bed with all the major media distributors and their hands are tied.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:13.360]   So that's why I'm rallying against tiered internet again.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.760]   The notion that we're going to have be paying per gigabyte on these devices very soon.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.040]   And that might roll over to some broadband, you know, cable modem plans is ridiculous
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.240]   because that's where they'll get you.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.800]   HBO will offer their service HBO go for four bucks a month or whatever.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.040]   And then Verizon's going to say, well, if you stream HBO go, that's going to go against
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.600]   your data plan unless you sign up for our service and you'll get unlimited streaming through
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.600]   us.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.320]   It's an end around neutrality and it's disgusting.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.400]   It's going to cripple innovation and so many industries, not just wireless industries,
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.840]   but can you imagine going back to worrying about streaming a YouTube video or streaming
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.000]   Netflix because you might be over your bandwidth cap for the month?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.080]   That's happening now and it's going to get worse.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.880]   Well, and what you propose is actually going to happen.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.520]   I believe it was AT&T that announced that, yeah, what we're going to do is we're going
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.800]   to let some applications ride free on our network.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:09.440]   So they don't like FaceTime, so they don't use any of your data limit.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.320]   And of course, that's exactly what's going to happen.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.640]   They're going to go to Netflix and say, we were very much like the have you be a partner
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.720]   in this program and that flips.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.000]   But first you got to show us what you got.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   And you know what?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.400]   Now you've just got a new incumbent instead of Comcast.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   You've got AT&T.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.760]   That's exactly the same.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.720]   And all the net neutrality legislation was going back and forth and people are like,
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.040]   hey, hooray, we got net neutrality for broadband for wired broadband.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.720]   I was like, did you guys miss the sleight of hand where Verizon and Google won the end
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:44.480]   of net neutrality for wireless, which is clearly where everything is going right now?
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.200]   We completely lost that battle.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.480]   But to the AT&T thing about FaceTime, they're saying you could FaceTime on 3G.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   That's fine.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.640]   But you have to buy one of our shared data plans.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.840]   And that's how they're going to get you.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.680]   That's the perfect example of that.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:02.080]   You know, they make this stuff so complicated that the normal consumer has in a hope and
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.280]   hell of figuring out how they're getting screwed.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.080]   No seriously.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.760]   I rented on stick ham the other day about buying a 4G LTE modem from Verizon and I felt
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.760]   used.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:16.680]   I had to project myself to the quarter of the store like a rape victim when I was purchasing
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.400]   the device because they make you pay to be a new user.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.280]   They make you pay for the SIM card or whatever the card that goes into the device a couple
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.440]   of bucks there.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   You have to buy the device.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.040]   You have to sign up for two years or you pay more monthly.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.840]   Then once you bought the device, you have to pay to tether it to the bandwidth plan that
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.040]   you're paying for.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.360]   It's like ordering a drink at a restaurant.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:38.600]   You have to pay to go in, pay to sit down, buy their glass, buy the water for the glass.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.400]   And then you have to pay for a proprietary straw and the rights to use the straw in the
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.400]   water.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.400]   You've already purchased.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.600]   It blew my mind.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.600]   It blew my mind.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   Did you scream like a woman?
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   What did you...
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   How did you...
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   I was dressed like one.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.600]   So we're just screaming.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   Don't.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   Look that way.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   We're going to take...
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.600]   I thought I would get better treatment.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:56.600]   We're going to take a break.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   We have more Apple news.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:06.280]   Kenny, the clown, has been caught now, red-handed and nosed with Steve Jobs' iPad and many more
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.880]   equally exciting and important stories.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:13.360]   I had a burrito for lunch.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.360]   Do you...
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.360]   Callie Lewis is here.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.920]   Cheryl Azar, Kevin Pereira, more to come in just a bit on this beautiful...
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.040]   The beautiful Twit, the beautiful edition is what I'm calling it.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.640]   Which we contain.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.440]   The taint is off.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   You did it.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.440]   The taint has rubbed off.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.440]   She says, "This is entertainment."
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.080]   And it's best.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:39.240]   I'm just going to quote big body tad in our chat room who says, "Kevin is surprisingly
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   awesome."
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.280]   Thank you for that compliment.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.880]   Put it on the back of your hand.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   It's very fine.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.720]   He's not as much of a D-bag as we thought.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720]   I'm still going to hate him.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   I'm not that bad.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.720]   He's not bad.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   He's 4% in.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   No, you're great.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:57.760]   It's great to have all three of you.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.240]   You know what's good is we're getting a little bit of the Hollywood perspective here with
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.000]   both Kevin and Shira because you're down in LA.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.480]   And the perspective on technology is very different in LA than it is up here.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.200]   And I'm sure that it is in Dallas because it's an entertainment capital.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:19.720]   And I think LA has been circling around Silicon Valley for some time now.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.440]   It's really hitting up other ceremonies.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:26.840]   Yeah, there's so many incubation engines going on and so many celebrities forming their own
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:30.600]   teams to use their brands to launch products and get fun for .coms.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.000]   It's a wild time down here.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.960]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.840]   The new Squarespace is here.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   Everything you need to create an awesome website.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.840]   I don't say this enough.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.880]   So I want to say it now.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.400]   It's hosting to start.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.480]   So people always say, "Oh, I need a great web host.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.400]   I know a content management system.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.800]   I know it's software, but I need a great web host."
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.240]   Start with the web host, squarespace.com.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:58.000]   And then what's beautiful about Squarespace is the tight integration between the hosting
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.880]   they provide and the Squarespace software and the new Squarespace.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.720]   Just fantastic.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.960]   You've got to try it.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:11.920]   One of the things that they've taken Squarespace into the new era.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.120]   One of the things they've done is its responsive design.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.400]   That's the hot topic right now in web design.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.400]   Why?
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   Because so many people are looking at your site on a variety of different devices from
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:26.200]   a three and a half inch iPhone to a 27 inch display to everything in between.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.640]   So how do you make your site?
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.320]   Do you have a special mobile site?
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.760]   That's the old way of doing it now.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.640]   What they do is responsive design.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   Squarespace is doing that.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:37.680]   Every time you put an image, for instance, on your website, they size seven different
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   sizes.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.480]   So it looks great on any device.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.360]   When you do the design, it's automatically responsive.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.200]   So you can arrange your site the way you like it.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.120]   Start with those great templates over 50 wonderful templates.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.280]   And then you can customize it.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.200]   And the responsive design is automatic.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.440]   It's built in.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.280]   You don't make a separate site for mobile.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:08.040]   Latest web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript Foundations for beautiful, beautiful
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   pages.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.680]   They've got the Google fonts, 300 plus fonts.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.240]   So you're not limited to those same whole four web fonts.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:21.440]   Get into your social media like Facebook, Instagram, Google+, for the three people that
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:27.120]   use it, including Shira Lazar, Twitter, four squared Dropbox, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Stumble
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   Upon.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.160]   It's all in there.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:35.600]   You're just going to love the new Squarespace, but they've really done a great job.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.400]   David Lee Roth for Squarespace.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.840]   Yes I am.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.160]   Go to Squarespace.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.600]   You can try it.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.600]   You know what?
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.320]   Should we make a David Lee Roth?
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.560]   What is that song running with the devil?
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.640]   He's signing the devil.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.120]   We could make a running with the devil website right now.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.120]   Let's do it.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.120]   I'll show you how it is.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.360]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.080]   Click the Get Started button.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.480]   I'll pick a template, but you know, what did they do?
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.080]   Do they log me in?
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.080]   What happened?
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.200]   Now I did something because I have a Squarespace site.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.400]   Maybe they may be a guy confused.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   Okay.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.400]   There we go.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.200]   What do you think?
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.480]   Atelier, tack, native, front row.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.480]   I like the surfboard.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.480]   We're going to start with that template.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   All right.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.280]   We're going to pick that right there.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   We're going to set it up.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.200]   Then all you have to do, you don't give them a credit card.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.920]   Just give them a name and address.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.080]   Let's do a spam.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.000]   I'm going to do at leoville.com because I don't want to get a lot of spam.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.720]   I'm going to, the password will be David Lee Roth.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.720]   There we go.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.360]   We're going to create a site, David Lee Roth.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.440]   You'll log in with spam at leoville.com and David Lee Roth.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.560]   Now I give it to you guys.
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.480]   For two weeks now, you can do anything you want.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.560]   You can put the sound up there.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.960]   You can put an embedded video.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.400]   I want to see some creativity.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.680]   Leo dash, support.squarespace.com.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.680]   There it is.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.680]   Start building that site.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   I give it to you.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   Now that's absolutely free.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.680]   It costs me nothing.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.220]   I didn't even give him a credit card or anything.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:11.640]   If after two weeks you say, "Hey, this is a pretty great David Lee Roth running with the
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:15.560]   devil's site."
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.480]   I want to keep it.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.040]   Look at the pricing here on Squarespace.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.880]   It's just fantastic.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.000]   They've kind of revamped the pricing.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.040]   There's really two different plans.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.040]   That's it.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.000]   You can go monthly or yearly.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.320]   I recommend yearly because that's the best savings.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.880]   Eight dollars a month for the basic, but here's the one you're going to want.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.720]   The $16 a month when you pay for the year.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.720]   Unlimited pages, galleries and blogs.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.880]   You could have every David Lee Roth image ever created.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.880]   Unlimited bandwidth.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.920]   If a million people visit the site, you don't care.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.880]   Unlimited storage.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.000]   Unlimited contributors.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.800]   We can hook it up with a custom domain name with the annual plan.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.560]   Either annual plan, you get the domain name and they do all the hook up and everything
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.240]   absolutely free.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.960]   You got to like this.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.800]   Squarespace.com.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.960]   David Lee Roth is running with the Squarespace.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.600]   Offricode, by the way, if you decide to buy, do use the offer code TWIT8.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.680]   Twit in the number eight because you get 10% off your first purchase and if it's the
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.720]   annual plan, you'll save the most.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.960]   TWIT8 is our offer code this month for the month of August.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.360]   I love Squarespace.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   Running with the devil.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.760]   That's a great sum and I'm never going to be able to listen to it again in the same way.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   Nope.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.760]   You absolutely won't.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.760]   That is hysterical.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   I love that.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.400]   You need to get the Smash Mouth one as well.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   I'm going to listen to it.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.400]   It's all on YouTube.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:43.600]   You know, I have to say for all of its flaws and everything and I just YouTube has really
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.240]   transformed everything in terms of anything on YouTube.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.240]   It's all.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.240]   It's all.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   It's like the Wikipedia media.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.240]   How cool it was.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.240]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.240]   Yeah, Google.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.560]   You know, when Google bought them for what was billions of dollars, four billion, something
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.280]   like that, I was a little worried because I thought they're going to be sued out of existence.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.480]   In fact, I remember interviewing the guys who started YouTube before Google bought them,
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.560]   like the month before, Steve Chen.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.760]   And I said, Steve, how are you going to stay in business because the rights holders are
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   going to kill you?
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.600]   And he said, we'll worry about that later.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:22.840]   I think the Parker program for them was really revolutionary because they created a marketplace
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.000]   on YouTube for people that got a lot of views.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.440]   But why would they stay there?
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.120]   You know, they could have gone into merch or started their own little, you know, used
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.840]   their own video players on their own sites and moved the community there.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.480]   But because of this partner program, it made it really easy for people to stay there.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.480]   And that was the win.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.480]   That was a big win.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:47.600]   And then it was obvious that other outlets had to be there too because that's where the
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   community was.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.320]   That was the future generation of viewers.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.440]   So it's changed in a lot of ways.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.400]   Google bought YouTube just for correction for $1.6 billion in 2006 Google stock.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.600]   That was cheap, maybe.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.080]   Yeah, except if they held that stock, it's probably worth five, six, ten, ten.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.680]   And times that, I don't know what the stock value went up to.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.920]   It's now over 600 bucks, right?
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.000]   So we found out who stole Steve Jobs' iPad.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   No, we didn't.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   We still don't know.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   You're lying, Leo.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.360]   So no, well, no, no, no, they found the guy's name was, well, I'm not going to say his name
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:29.440]   because he's allegedly stole the iPad from Steve Jobs' home at Palo Alto.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.160]   He didn't know it was Steve Jobs' house.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.880]   It just was easy to break into because Jobs very famously talks about this in biography,
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.520]   did not want to have a fenced, gated house.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.000]   He wanted his kids to grow up in a normal environment in Palo Alto.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.240]   So the guy who stole it apparently gave his iPad or sold his iPad.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.680]   No, he gave it to a friend.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.720]   To a friend who was--
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.160]   He gave the old hand some money.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.680]   And the friend was Kenny the Clown.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.480]   Here's the picture of Kenny the Clown.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.960]   That's an awesome picture.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.720]   But I don't get clowns.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720]   I-- this is scary.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.720]   He was--
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   --never been a burning man.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.720]   I'll tell you, enough LSD will make anything make sense.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.800]   Here's a video of Kenny the Clown.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.200]   No way, but there's an ad first.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   Gosh darn it.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.360]   It's not that interesting of a video, Leo.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.360]   OK.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.600]   He just basically says how weird it was.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:28.000]   He's a huge fan of Steve Jobs and how he known that this was a stolen iPad.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.640]   He thought the thief was just giving him an old path.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.640]   Right.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:40.680]   Well, he let the alleged thief borrow some money in the alleged thief,
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:46.480]   said that he was giving him the iPad instead because it was his older iPad or something.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.720]   And he didn't have the money to pay him.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.320]   So that was kind of the transaction.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.600]   Ah.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.080]   Ah.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.320]   Kenny the Clown, by the way, just in case you're curious, ran for mayor of San Francisco in 2007.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.320]   No way.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.320]   Yes.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.360]   Of course he does.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.680]   No word on whether he won.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.720]   But unless he took the makeup off, I thought he won't think so.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.720]   Right.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.720]   San Francisco.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:15.520]   I just think this guy, if he goes jail for this, he's going to be a hero in jail.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.520]   Right?
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520]   Kenny the Clown?
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   No, no, no, the thief.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520]   Oh, the thief?
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.600]   The thief is going to be a hero given that he broke into Steve Jobs' house.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.280]   What's an under construction or something?
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.880]   Yeah, I guess it was under construction.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.360]   His security system was just burning sage.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.360]   It wasn't that hard to get out.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360]   It's so delicious.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.360]   It waltz right on him.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.360]   It's not my turn.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.360]   It sends vortex that he just waddled through it.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.360]   You may not come in.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.680]   Not that big a deal to steal an iPad from an unprotected house.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:51.040]   The new retail chief of Apple, you know, Apple's original retail chief, was it Philip Johnson?
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040]   No, Johnson something.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.040]   Anyway, went to JCPenney.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:04:01.200]   He says he's going to revamp JCPenney to be more like Apple stores.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.160]   And one of the things he's going to do is get rid of clerks.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160]   Okay.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.680]   He's going to modernize JCPenney.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.400]   He's going to modernize JCPenney.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.480]   It's just what I'm looking for when I go in to buy underwear.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480]   Apple.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.000]   Did that happen a while ago?
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.640]   Well, he got the job a while ago and he went over there recently.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.240]   You mean the clerks leaving JCPenney?
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.240]   Did that happen already?
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.240]   I don't know.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.400]   That he said that he was going to make it.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   Yeah, that was a while.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.840]   Ron Johnson is going to have a while.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.920]   So the new real tale chief comes in and decides he's going to, we got too many people.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:44.960]   He fires a bunch of people, including a bunch of retail people.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   Apparently he's changed his mind.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.960]   Oops.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.880]   And he hired them all back.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.880]   With the iPhone 5.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.240]   Why would you fire people right before the iPhone 5 comes out?
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.680]   That's a crazy move.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.680]   I agree.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.880]   I guess we're all in.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.240]   What happens for last time?
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.080]   I'm reading the story for the first time.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   I apologize.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.520]   What happened is, you know, remember there was all of this about in the New York Times
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.600]   about how Apple store people are underpaid.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.640]   So he gave them all a 25% raise and then he realized it was too expensive.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.600]   So he fires a quarter of them.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.600]   And then people.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   Well, he fired.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.520]   Someone was like in his budget.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.160]   This guy is not a genius.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160]   I don't know.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.160]   It does not bode well.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.160]   I'm just saying.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.160]   You can't work at his own bar.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   Is that what you mean?
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.120]   Yeah, he's not at the genius bar level yet.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:39.480]   Well, so Web 81 94 in the chat remastered me why it was a crazy move.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:44.280]   Maybe they do have too many people in the stores, which I would say if they had just
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:50.560]   left it at, OK, they fired these people, then yeah, maybe that was the right move.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.720]   But then he reversed his decision and started hiring people back.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   More people.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   More people.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:02.160]   I don't know if you know, do you know, do you ever shop at Dixon's?
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.320]   That's that that's where this guy came from.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.400]   Yeah, that's where this guy came from Dixon's.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.400]   What is it?
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.560]   This is a good story.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560]   Really good preparation.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.800]   Low priced electricals and kitchen appliances.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   Wow.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.040]   I mean, is this was this because of you think this has anything to do with a stock price
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.800]   when they announce our employees are paid too much?
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.800]   We're going to trim back.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.680]   We're going to make some cuts and then they go, you know, we're going to rehire because
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:30.200]   stock volatility will go down as much with the announcement of a rehiring versus the
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.200]   announcement of, you know, pruning.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.760]   Are you saying you think it was planned that way?
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.680]   Either plan that way or a smart reaction based upon stock.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.520]   I mean, I don't know how it went down.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   I certainly don't.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.920]   Well, whenever they did, they did the right thing.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:49.400]   This week on Friday, Apple broke a new record for market cap and stock price.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.480]   Record record.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:56.360]   It's worth the company's now worth more than $600 billion.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.080]   So whatever they're doing, they're doing okay.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.240]   In fact, it's interesting because at the same time as Apple is setting records, everybody's
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.400]   starting to look at Facebook.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:09.320]   In fact, Facebook stopped tanked on a Thursday because a number of employees, the lockout,
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:15.080]   I guess that you get a 180 day lockout after initial public offering where employees can't
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.040]   sell their stock the minute they could, which is Thursday.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.280]   They apparently dumped quite a bit of stock on the stock.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.720]   Well, you know who these people are.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   They're like our friends.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.520]   They're all people who want to kind of travel abroad.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.560]   And they want to begin their own startups and they're like, you know, you never know.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.160]   They want to leave knowing they had something, not, you know, hang in there.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.160]   Right.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.160]   It also could have been people who bought stock on the secondary market who got, you know,
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:41.560]   through like shares post and actually bought employee stock before it was publicly available.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.120]   But I think the real story is that people are over, I think they're overreacting to the
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.960]   news of the stock tanking because depending upon who you asked, it's still hyperinflated.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.600]   The price is still incredibly hard.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.320]   Yeah, it's 31 times earnings.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.880]   So I mean, it'll sort itself out in a few years.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:59.520]   It's just those who wanted to get in at the craps table for the short game are feeling the
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.520]   pressure, right?
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.000]   But the chips on the table for the long game, they're fine with it.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   Right.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.440]   And business insider wrote an open letter to Facebook employees and basically said, don't
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.440]   panic.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:14.200]   It's going to be, it's going to be okay.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:19.800]   Not the stock price never coming back, but don't be like, you're never going to use this
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.160]   dear Facebook employees.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.400]   Here's the truth about your stock price.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.680]   He says, the stock crash has nothing to do with the quality of Facebook as a company.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.520]   I think it's probably true, right?
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.920]   The market is reassessing Facebook.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:39.600]   Because of decelerating revenue growth and the shift to mobile and so forth.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.640]   All these factors suggest Facebook's unlikely to be the next Google, which is what people
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.720]   thought when it went public.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.080]   So that's why the price was so high.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.400]   And now reality has set in.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.880]   He says, that's the, it's not your fault.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.560]   It's the investors fault.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.520]   And he does point out, as you did, Kevin, the stock is very expensive, still 31 times
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.480]   earnings.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.240]   We people wanted to hit so bad.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.240]   We wanted another $1,999.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.240]   We did.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.240]   A treasure trail.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.840]   I'm going to go get a hybrid car and a helicopter.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:12.160]   We wanted another big.com story so bad, because we're still hurting from every other bubble
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.160]   that's burst.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.160]   And this just wasn't going to be it.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.960]   But it's amazing, you know, how, what happens when you actually have to prove your worth
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.360]   and prove what you are doing in your company.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.360]   These days, a lot of companies just sit there and say, we're just going to try and get the
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:35.480]   user base and try and get an audience before we even think about what we're worth or what
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.120]   making money and all of that.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.360]   This is a, this is a, I feel like it has some connection, you know, I mean, this is a good,
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.640]   good thing for people who are starting companies to look at and to kind of work towards before
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.960]   they get to that point.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.800]   I think there's a lot of people sitting right now, sitting down going, my company has a
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.960]   $400 billion valuation.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   Right.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.840]   And I think, oh, maybe we should wait before we go public and make sure we have, I don't
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840]   know, a business model.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.120]   The scary thing is when you talk to investors or VCs, the out is always like, okay, well,
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.480]   you get acquired or you go public.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.080]   And the fact that, I mean, how many percent of companies should be going public, actually?
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.200]   I think we overestimate the amount of people that should be going public, but it's like,
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.800]   it shows, improves your success.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:23.040]   If you go public, when companies shouldn't be going public, staying private, and possibly
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.360]   they might not even get acquired.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:30.280]   But we expect this overnight success these days with these rock star web digital properties.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.920]   Here's an interesting thing.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.880]   Google just bought Fromers Guides, the guidebooks for $143 million.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.120]   I think it's smart.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.120]   Really?
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.960]   Smart, what do they need the guidebooks for?
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.320]   They'll integrate the photos, the rich media.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.520]   They'll integrate the, I mean, if you look at the travel industry and how things are booked
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.280]   online, Google wants, when you're searching for a trip to Bahamas, they want to offer
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.120]   you information about the Bahamas.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.840]   You know, they bought the engine that powers Kayak.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.560]   They want you to purchase your plane tickets through them.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.320]   They want a piece of that industry.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.680]   And this gives them an overnight database that could rival Yelp or TripAdvisor.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.640]   I mean, they tried to buy Yelp and they failed.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.560]   So this is their new approach.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.600]   It's interesting that Google is putting, I agree with you, Kevin.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.640]   I think it's a fantastic move.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.520]   They're putting a ton of effort into the local search, into trying to make sure your whole
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.720]   trip can be planned out.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.640]   Whereas Microsoft with Bing is putting a lot of effort and their focus into the social
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.840]   aspect of search where you can ask your friends for advice.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:35.080]   If you combine those two approaches, what we would have is, I think, just an amazing
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.080]   search experience.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.480]   Yeah, but who uses guidebooks?
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.880]   Does anybody still use guidebooks?
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880]   Don't you just?
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.440]   Well, maybe not the physical books, but the data contained within.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.080]   I mean, I recently, I used TripAdvisor for a lot.
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.400]   I used Yelp for a lot of decisions.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.400]   Right.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.600]   No, but that's my point.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.560]   Why would you use Fromr's guides when you could use something that's up to any control
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.560]   that experience?
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.640]   Google is going to promote their content first.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.560]   So when I search for a trip to Turks and Caicos, I'm going to get, it's going to be Fromr's
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.320]   data, but that's going to pop up before TripAdvisor or something else.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.000]   So now it shouldn't be about TripAdvisor, shouldn't they about Yelp?
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   Maybe they didn't want to follow.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   They tried to buy Yelp.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.560]   They did try to buy Yelp.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.560]   I apologize.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.680]   The price that I gave was for zigat guides.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.600]   They paid $23 million for Fromr's.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600]   A little bit less.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.560]   Well, that's a lot less.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.560]   Yeah, that's low.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:26.440]   And there's been controversy over the purchasing of those guides and propagating their content
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.920]   and their results to the top of the search engine.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.840]   Some people are very upset about that, but that's sort of the nature of their travel
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.840]   play.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840]   That's the nature of their beast.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.120]   And you know, I guess $23 million is not, I mean, that's chicken feed to Google, right?
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.680]   Yeah, that's nothing.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.800]   Literally, that's what they used to feed their chickens at the--
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.800]   Literally.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.800]   So organic.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800]   No glucose in the market.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.000]   I guess I understand zigat for $150 million because they couldn't get Yelp and they wanted
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.480]   that kind of information.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.660]   But Yelp is more up to date.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.020]   Maybe there's some problems, potential problems with Yelp.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:06.680]   It just seems like an editorially driven guidebook like Fromr's compared to crowd sourced information
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.480]   like TripAdvisor, which would you choose?
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.280]   I think what Cali says holds true is that we're going to see a hybrid of that.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.280]   It's clear that Google--
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.840]   Google has tried to activate social results within their search engine.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.120]   They haven't had the best of luck.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.680]   I don't know if Bing is faring any better.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.200]   I just heard about Bing today.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.000]   Yeah, I hear this.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.760]   Yeah, I asked Jeeves and he told me about it.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.160]   But I think that once Google figures it out, they switch it on.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.200]   When you get a hybrid of here's our information matched with the social results of your friends,
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.920]   that, as Cali said, that's an incredible result.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.920]   That could be the new gold standard.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.360]   All right, now I want to be plus Leo Laporta on G plus, plus.google.com.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.240]   Some people have already got it plus Toyota.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.640]   You'll get a Toyota page.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.560]   Can I do plus Shira Lazar yet on Google plus?
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.960]   Yeah, I'm on Google plus.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.040]   No, no, but this is the new thing where you have your own--
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   What is your name?
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.000]   I'm going to ask them for the vanity pages.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.040]   Yeah, because if I go to Shira Lazar on Google plus--
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.120]   I still need to do my vanity page.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.120]   I've been in touch with them.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.120]   They were supposed to help me.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:18.440]   They're like-- as am I, by the way, like a 20-digit number is your official Google plus.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.440]   Your Google plus address is plus.google.com.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:28.480]   Everybody should write this down slash 1071339485539489679.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:34.640]   And of course, we have the third-party website G plus.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.440]   I trust that, though, because--
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.920]   I just got to go to the website.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.000]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.840]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.480]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.400]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.000]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.920]   I'm going to ask you to go to the website.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.520]   It's useful, but gosh, I can't wait until it's actually
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.160]   official.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.040]   But don't feel bad, sure, because my Google+ address
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.200]   is plus.google.com/101261239.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.280]   I don't use Google+.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.820]   I wonder if there's an order that just
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.920]   creates a caperara account and uses it as my profile image.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.160]   You don't use Google+ at all?
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.120]   OK, here, let's get this shot.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.280]   Just-- this is strangest flashlight I've ever seen.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.040]   Super props for this, too.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:28.560]   What is it?
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.080]   What is it?
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   What is it?
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.680]   I'm going to know how the party is going down,
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:32.480]   so I can't prepare it.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.240]   I'm an internet boy scout.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.440]   It's a creepy jelly.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.800]   So someone could just create that profile for me.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.720]   That'd be fantastic.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.400]   And then I'll get the password later.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.840]   You know, there's two people who have
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.800]   flashed weapons on this show.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.640]   You and Adam Curry.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.280]   I'll take that.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.000]   I have a sword sitting over there.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   You guys want a sword?
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.440]   No, no, no, no.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.960]   You have a firearm and a flashlight, though.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.320]   I refuse to believe.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.640]   No, I need a lead.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.480]   Because I'm in the middle of rehearsals,
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.880]   and they're all-- my whole production.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:01.480]   I was supposed to do a rehearsal at 4 p.m.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.280]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.640]   Nobody told you that Twitter is actually
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   5-hour marathon.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.320]   I know.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.000]   I usually hang out.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.880]   I feel really bad.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.480]   I'm getting told I need to--
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.240]   Wow.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.960]   My whole staff is here, so I go over.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.440]   Are they just sitting there like eyeing you angrily
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.920]   as you sit in the wax?
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.960]   One person is.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.040]   I'm not going to say who.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.920]   I'm being eyed angrily right now.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.080]   Oh, tell that Damon guy.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.640]   I'll leave you alone.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.160]   Hey--
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.600]   Get him on the camera.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.760]   You're going to miss the fireworks.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.320]   Get him on the fireworks.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.760]   So give us the information.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.560]   You're launching daily tomorrow.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.080]   What time?
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.040]   Tomorrow.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.720]   Noon daily, noon live, Pacific time, 3 p.m.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.560]   Eastern, youtube.com/wetstrending.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.520]   And also, wetstrending.com.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.440]   We post daily 24/7 through our social also.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.840]   But it's going to be awesome.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.520]   We have a ton of people who stand
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.000]   Lee coming on the show, Jase Hall.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.840]   We have YouTube stars galore every single day.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.160]   We're going to be just live every single day
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.680]   creating the best of YouTube.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:03.120]   So you want to bookmark us as your almost like YouTube home
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.360]   page.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.200]   So we're going to move your avatar.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.040]   Thank you, Shirley.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.480]   It's our great to see you.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.000]   We're going to now roll your monitor out of here.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.760]   Get it out of here.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.360]   Go away.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.680]   Roll it out of here.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.400]   While we rolling out of here, I'm going to talk about stamps.com.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.040]   And then we will regroup with a more intimate Cali Lewis, Kevin
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.520]   Pereira, and me.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.040]   And now.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:25.920]   You hate now.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.560]   But first, stamps.com.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.080]   I got to tell you, I do not go to the post office anymore.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.960]   You needn't go to the post office anymore.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.440]   Because stamps.com lets your print official US postage
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.160]   right from your desk with your computer and your printer.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.120]   And it is awesomeness.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.760]   You can even-- you don't ever have to go to the post office
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.840]   because the post office will come pick up the packages.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.120]   You can even schedule free pickups.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.160]   It's just fantastic.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.480]   A 24/7 solution for sending letters and packages.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.720]   Buy and print official US postage anytime you need it.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.280]   They have, by the way-- and you're going to get this.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.520]   I'm going to tell you how you can get it.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.400]   This USB scale.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.920]   You plop the letter on there so you always
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.240]   have the right postage, a letter or package.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.320]   It's just fantastic.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.600]   If you're sending international stuff,
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.400]   they fill out the forms for eBay sellers, Amazon sellers.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.000]   Really awesome.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.760]   Because you don't ever have to type in the address
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.560]   that you're mailing it to.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.560]   It just takes that right off the page.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.440]   It makes it so easy.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.120]   If you do a lot of mailing-- and I think any business probably
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.800]   does--
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.280]   stamps.com is fantastic.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.720]   Visit stamps.com right now.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.240]   You'll see an $80 bonus offer.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.960]   And you might say, well, that's a pretty good deal.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.560]   I'm going to take it.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.040]   Don't.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.160]   I can get you a better deal.
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.120]   Do not go for that $80 value.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.280]   Click the radio microphone.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.560]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.680]   It's going to turn into a $110 bonus offer, including,
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.080]   yes, the digital scale.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.560]   You just pay shipping and handling for that.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.200]   It's about $5.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:50.360]   You get $55 in free postage coupons.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.440]   Wow.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.400]   You get the supply kit and a four week trial,
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.000]   all from stamps.com.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.360]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.840]   But you got to use the offer code TWIT
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.120]   to take full advantage of it.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.160]   Stamps.com never go to the post office again.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.240]   All right, we've rearranged.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:06.760]   Look at that.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.260]   It's a miracle.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:08.720]   It's magic.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.800]   And I actually am glad, because I
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.120]   want to callie a little closer, even though she has a--
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.080]   they say it's not a sword.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.320]   It's a katana.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.520]   Oh, we've lost her audio.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.680]   Did you mute?
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.020]   I did.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:20.680]   Sorry.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.040]   I had to write a note.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.120]   It is a katana.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:24.920]   How do they know?
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.440]   How do people in the chat room know
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.920]   that you have a Japanese samurai sword in your office?
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.680]   Well, gourd, Michelaud, is actually one of our bloggers.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.880]   Oh, he's a friend in the chat.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.200]   He's one of our editors, actually.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:38.640]   Sorry.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.680]   Oh, all right.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.040]   There you go.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.920]   Anyway, good to have you back.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.160]   Oh, and the katana came out on the last episode of Geekbeat.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.960]   That's probably where they saw it.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.720]   Yeah, sure.
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.040]   Yeah, where'd you get a samurai sword?
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   It's actually John Pease.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.480]   No, that doesn't surprise me.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.480]   Yeah, he-- well, he's a bladesmith, so he's all in--
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.120]   He made it?
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.400]   All sorts of-- no, he didn't make that particular one,
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.360]   but he's into it, so he got a real one.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:06.840]   So let's talk patent wars.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:10.120]   There's, of course, the Samsung Apple lawsuits
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.200]   drawing to an end.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:15.960]   That court case is almost over.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.600]   I guess they have final arguments.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.800]   Right, Samsung's done.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.400]   Apple's done.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.680]   He's scrolled down. This is such a long story.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.240]   Apple has rested its case.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:27.600]   Sam--
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.200]   It gets really exciting by page 35.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.640]   Jeez, the tweet.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.880]   So closing arguments are Tuesday, day after tomorrow.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.800]   And now, OK, you're on the jury, Kevin Carrera.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.120]   Look at that.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.040]   He disappeared, like magic.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.800]   As soon as I put the test--
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.960]   you're on the jury, Kevin Carrera.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.760]   You're on the jury, Cali Lewis.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.000]   Have you been following this Apple Samsung trial?
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.320]   Who do you find for?
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.240]   And what are the damages?
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.960]   Apple's asking $2.5 billion damages.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:58.440]   I seriously just want to go to sleep every time I go about this.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.760]   There's some good stuff in here.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.320]   But really, do you think Samsung copied Apple?
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:14.880]   Well, I think you could pick apart every single new gadget
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.520]   or whatever and say it's a copy of something else.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.320]   What's that saying?
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.080]   Yes.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.000]   There's nothing that's actually new.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.760]   But there are some similarities in the doc.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:31.080]   I think that's part of the dispute, how Samsung does the doc.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.280]   But I don't think that that's necessarily--
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.600]   and I'm not like a lawyer or anything.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.040]   So I--
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.000]   No, I'm not.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:40.520]   And you know what--
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520]   And it's necessarily a--
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.960]   Cali neither is the jury.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.360]   And that's kind of the point here.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.320]   The lawyers have had their say.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.160]   Now common sense comes into play.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.280]   I say Apple just move on.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:50.640]   Yes.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.920]   Samsung do their thing.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.600]   They have--
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.040]   I don't think they're using that doc feature that they had
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:02.000]   on the whatever phone it was back then that whatever.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.320]   It's just like move on.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.960]   Yes, you do have to stand up for your patents,
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.040]   and you have to go through those legal rights.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.480]   But just move on at this point.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.360]   How about you, Kevin?
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   You agree?
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360]   Apple should just move on.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   [GROANING]
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.600]   You're asleep too, huh?
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.760]   Listen, I'm-- these kind of issues,
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.000]   they stifle the industry.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:28.520]   They really--
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.000]   It's bad.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.240]   They hold back innovation.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:30.840]   It's terrible.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.120]   With that said, there was a site that
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.760]   had a great rundown in comparison of what their phones were
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.880]   like pre-iPhone and what their user interface and phones
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.520]   were like post-iPhone.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:43.400]   Clearly, some design cues were stolen or borrowed
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.000]   or iterated upon from the doc.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.200]   To the icons, to the overall design of the phone.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.000]   Remember when the first iPhone came out?
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.280]   It was seen as a revolutionary design.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.640]   And then a year later, it was--
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.140]   Right.
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:53.800]   There was a thousand--
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.400]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:54.900]   Yeah.
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.760]   Yeah, so clearly some things were stolen.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.600]   But this kind of bickering and infighting
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.920]   is only bad for the mobile industry.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.240]   But I also understand a company's need
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.280]   to protect their design patents.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.400]   I get really worried when I see natural human gestures
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.040]   being patented.
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:10.560]   Right.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.160]   You know, like the fact that a wave could
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:15.360]   be patented by a connect device by Microsoft
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.440]   or Apple could say, we own the chicken wing, which
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.880]   shuffles your iTunes tracks.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.800]   Like, no, this is something that I can naturally do.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.760]   You shouldn't be able to own that.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   That's where I get started.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.680]   Kevin, that is a brilliant, brilliant thought.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.360]   We should all be doing the chicken dance to control our stuff.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.160]   All the gestures are going to be gobbled up.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.520]   That's all that's going to be left.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.360]   You're going to have robot moves to delete icons.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.400]   You're going to have the wave dubstep dance.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.560]   Like, these are the only gestures that are left.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:42.120]   That would be pretty hilarious.
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.200]   But it's going to be sad.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.320]   Well, it's going to get worse.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.600]   Your nap time can continue because Google on Friday,
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.440]   via Motorola, it's new subsidiary,
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:55.480]   filed a lawsuit against Apple, asking the International Trade
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.880]   Commission to block all imports of the iPhone, iPad,
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.800]   and Macintosh into the United States.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.560]   Obviously, they know that that's not going to happen.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.040]   What?
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.360]   No, not obvious.
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.520]   Not obvious at all.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.880]   Why is that obvious?
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:16.440]   iPhones and iDevices won't be able to be brought in and sold
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:16.960]   in the US.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.080]   Apple successfully blocked the Google Nexus phone from the US
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.160]   as part of this trial.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.600]   That's this is tip for tap.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.800]   Let's say it happens and that no other iDevices could be
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.920]   sold in the US.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.120]   Motorola mobility Google is going to be hated.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:35.520]   I know.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:36.800]   It's a risky thing to do.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.240]   I mean, this is Jetson Arms race.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.480]   Everybody's flexing their muscles.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.880]   Like everybody will settle down, they'll back off,
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.600]   they'll go and absorb more companies from more patents.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.760]   They'll sue again.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.080]   This is just wolves in the forest bearing their teeth.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.920]   I just think I should start patenting all sorts of stuff.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:55.760]   You should.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.160]   I'm going to start doing that.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.960]   Yeah, you're making a mistake if you're not doing it.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.400]   You're missing out on the big patent gold rush.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.760]   It is a patent gold rush, isn't it?
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:05.480]   Oh my goodness.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.160]   Well, the notion that this is patented.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:08.560]   Right.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.240]   That.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:09.800]   Right.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:10.240]   That.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.040]   Right there.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:11.540]   Right.
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.640]   And I can sue you for billions of dollars a few years back.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.680]   Crazy, crazy.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.200]   Insane.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.880]   Like every magician does that and then releases dubs.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.240]   But they didn't patent it.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.040]   Oh, they should have.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.040]   David Blaine took a huge misstep copper field.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.560]   Right, right.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.680]   That's what everybody got.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.800]   And now I'm suing Motorola.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.800]   Are you guys excited about the iPhone 5?
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.320]   What do you know about the iPhone 5?
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.840]   What are your sources telling you?
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:37.400]   Apple is creating a custom screw to screw over the customer.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.360]   And it's bull--
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.920]   Yeah, it's bull.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.360]   All right.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.960]   Well, no, they're not, actually.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.080]   And so there you go.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.040]   We don't-- I mean, the rumor mill is going crazy,
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.080]   because I think everybody kind of agrees
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.440]   that we are going to find out soon.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.840]   September 12 will be the announcement.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.200]   And that according to Imore--
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.040]   Renee Richie's been very accurate at Imore--
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.240]   that the pre-orders will be available then.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.680]   And that you-- so you'll be able to pre-order immediately.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.440]   Callie, will you pre-order the minute they announce it?
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.440]   Um.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.440]   Maybe.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:11.960]   We'll see.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.120]   See, that's interesting, because I bet you last year
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.160]   you would have said yes.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:16.880]   Well--
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.800]   4S, did you order it right away?
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:23.560]   You know, I don't think I even did the iPhone 4 that way.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.680]   Oh, OK.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:29.400]   I think the iPad-- the new iPad, I didn't order right away
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:29.840]   either.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.600]   I think they're making--
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:31.600]   I'm thinking of me.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.480]   I ordered it all right away.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:38.280]   I just think they're making so many incremental--
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:43.560]   like, small changes that are going into their releases.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.400]   I'd prefer to see larger.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.640]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.040]   But, you know, I was trying to--
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.560]   But you still use an iPhone, right?
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.720]   You still use an iPhone, right?
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:52.560]   I still use an iPhone.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.200]   I love both Android and iOS just to stop all the haters
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.800]   right now from attacking me.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.600]   I have a Galaxy tab from my tablet.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.080]   Whatever.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.320]   Open source for life.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.760]   Whatever.
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.520]   And then I have iPhone for my phone.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.680]   But, you know, I was trying to think back to previous years.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.720]   I don't remember them ever having pre-orders available
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.240]   the day of the announcement.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.920]   Am I mistaken?
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.440]   It's varied.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.960]   I'm thinking the iPad, yes.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.480]   iPhone 4s, yes, I think.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.240]   Was it day and day?
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.240]   I thought I remember people setting alarms
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.320]   to wake up for the pre-orders.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.320]   But that might have been fun.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:29.820]   Right.
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:30.320]   I thought it was--
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:30.320]   OK.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:30.820]   All right.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:32.320]   So maybe it is the first time on the iPhone.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.400]   I know for the sure, the iPad.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.280]   The chatroom's saying this is the first time.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.760]   Of course, the chatroom's never wrong.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.320]   Chatroom's saying this is the first time
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.160]   that they've ever done day and date.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.720]   That the iPhone 4s-- that's right.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.600]   Was two days later.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.200]   I remember that now.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.360]   OK.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:47.860]   So--
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:48.360]   That's interesting.
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.920]   I love that this is a story, though, that people
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.680]   are discussing.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.480]   And not just here.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.040]   I mean, this is a--
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:52.560]   Like people care about it.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.520]   Like, just the announcement of a phone
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:58.440]   and the way in which you can pre-order it is now a story.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.960]   And it shows you why fake stories like the screw
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:01.280]   blow up.
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:03.400]   They're so much excitement whenever Apple does something
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.040]   with a phone or a tablet.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.240]   You're going to be able to pre-order it that day!
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.400]   And I will cite unseen.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:11.400]   One of those guys.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.040]   You're carrying an iPhone IC, Kevin.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:13.840]   Yeah, I am.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.200]   And I said, every year I say I'm not going to do it.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.840]   The other 4s is just an incremental upgrade and upgrade.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.120]   And OK, I need it now.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.040]   Of course I need it, because someone else has it,
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.080]   and it's faster.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:23.960]   So they got me.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.800]   They got me by me.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.320]   They got me in their little tendrils.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:29.920]   But I really hope Google takes them down a peg or two.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:30.720]   They're getting really good.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.240]   I love the voice assistant search
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.200]   war that's brewing now.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.880]   The battle versus the Google voice.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.040]   I love that.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.160]   Bring that on.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.040]   Google's voice is fantastic.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:42.760]   Do you use that?
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.960]   What phone do you use it on?
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.160]   Well, I don't actually have a phone that does it,
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.480]   but I use it on my partner's phone.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.720]   John keeps coming over and saying, see, watch.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.560]   OK, let's have a race.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:53.560]   OK.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.440]   Yeah, he keeps using it.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.120]   I'm like, oh, that's so unfair.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.040]   This theory does not compare.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:28:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.000]   New Siri, though, the new Siri, the potential for that API
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.200]   to blow the doors off of the way we interact with services
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:06.880]   is incredible.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.440]   To go from Siri, find me a steakhouse nearby to saying,
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.400]   Siri, book me a reservation for four at a steakhouse nearby
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.000]   and send me directions via the navigation app.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.960]   That's something that it could potentially
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.280]   comprehend in the next one.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:20.960]   I love that.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.520]   Like, now it's going to get interesting.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.400]   If that's true and if that happens, then yeah.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.040]   Open table.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.600]   You can open table is one of the announced APIs.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.320]   So if a restaurant's open table, then there you go.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.120]   Well, ironically, Siri had that before Apple bought them.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.480]   That was already in Siri.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.560]   And then Apple bought them and took it out.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.080]   Sure.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.680]   I'm sure they wanted a better deal.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.680]   I'm sure they wanted to threaten to buy open table.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.640]   It's not a license.
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.360]   It's not that it couldn't do it.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.640]   It's just that Apple, maybe because of the vast number
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.800]   of people that would suddenly be using it, I don't know.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.040]   They couldn't do it.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.960]   The only thing that worries me-- and I've
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.840]   wine enough about it, so I'm not going to wine anymore--
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.520]   is this new Doc connector.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.400]   Now we believe we know it's a nine pin doc connector, which
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:06.720]   will be incompatible with all previous Apple iPhone cables
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.080]   and Doc connectors.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.000]   You don't think there's going to be--
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.200]   And again, what were they saying earlier?
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:14.280]   It's risky to put your whole business on one device
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.800]   or on a platform.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.920]   All of these companies are going to have to revamp everything.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:20.440]   Good plan.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.680]   And I think that 19 pin connector was getting old.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:25.480]   I think they held out for a long while with that connector.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.080]   And I'm sure we're going to see third party solutions that
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.400]   will be a little dongle or something that will convert
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.840]   all your boxes and all your cars and everything else
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:33.520]   and has the adapter.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.360]   I think it was about time to go to a smaller adapter that
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.560]   might be faster and charge a little quicker.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.360]   I don't disagree.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.680]   I think it'll be nice to have that smaller adapter.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:45.400]   I wish I almost wish it wasn't proprietary.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.760]   But again, we're talking about that.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.760]   Oh, it would have been so nice.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.320]   From what I'm saying.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.360]   Micro USB.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:52.600]   So Kevin, is your impression that the new nine pin cable
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.920]   will charge faster than the 30 pin did?
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.560]   I would be astonished if it didn't.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.760]   I mean, I think it clearly needs to sync faster
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.720]   the way these sizes are increasing.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:02.360]   It takes forever to back up your device.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.720]   And get photos off of it.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.600]   So I think it needs to sync faster and charge faster.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.160]   If it doesn't, what was the point changing it?
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.120]   You don't back up your device?
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.080]   Come on.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:12.600]   Oh, god.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:12.880]   It's--
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.920]   Come on.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.400]   All right.
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.200]   So we're going to take--
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.120]   Not nearly up.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.000]   Yeah, it's hot in here.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:18.440]   Woo.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.560]   I'm waiting for-- I'm waiting for Taintgate.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.320]   Is this not happening?
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:21.680]   Are we just--
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.040]   What are we supposed to fight it out?
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:23.400]   Does that happen?
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.040]   What are we supposed to battle it out?
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.680]   I think-- well, I'm getting a lot of tweets of people
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.680]   saying, hey, are you guys going to break it up?
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:29.600]   Is it going to happen?
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.160]   But I'm--
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:30.660]   All right.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.480]   We certainly don't have to.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.800]   I don't know why we would bring it up.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.040]   But you're the guy with a weapon.
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.720]   So I'm kind of just backing off.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.080]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.560]   I thought we were going to bring it up.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:39.840]   There was a--
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.360]   Tell me that's a cigarette lighter.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:41.800]   And I'll--
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.960]   It's where we said that it was going to get brought up.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.320]   I'm happy to not bring it up.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.720]   Tell me that's a cigarette lighter, and I'll bring it up.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.280]   It's airsoft.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.240]   Oh, you couldn't hurt me with that.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.840]   You could post my eye out.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.640]   I'll put my eye out before I put anybody else's eye out.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:55.360]   OK.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:55.800]   All right.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.400]   I will talk about it right after this.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.480]   But first--
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.480]   I'll talk about it.
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.800]   Let's talk a little bit about FreshBooks.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:06.320]   I tell you, I'm a FreshBooks customer since 2004.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.160]   That's when Amber MacArthur told me about it,
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:11.960]   because I was complaining, moaning, about how I had to do
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:12.680]   invoices.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.320]   Oh, this is such a pain in the butt.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.760]   And you know what would happen is I would never do the invoice.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.080]   And then I would-- or I would do it late,
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:19.880]   and then I wouldn't get paid.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.920]   And it was just frustrating as heck.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.080]   She said, you really got to try FreshBooks I did.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.400]   And now, I am one of-- what is it?
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.160]   They have it here, I think.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.120]   3 and 1/2 million FreshBooks users
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.720]   who have used the service since then?
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.920]   3 and 1/2 million.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:39.000]   So FreshBooks lets you create your own online invoices,
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.840]   which you then can email to your clients.
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.520]   And I'll tell you why not online invoices better.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.240]   First of all, it looks great.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:47.480]   But there's also a button on the invoice.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.360]   I love this.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.080]   It says, pay Leo.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.600]   Well, in your case, I'll say pay you, which is fantastic.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.800]   You're going to get paid faster, because what I've learned
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.520]   is clients, it's not that they don't want to pay you.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.240]   It's that it's just as much of a pain for them
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.040]   to go do the payroll or do the--
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.360]   write the checks that it is for you to invoice them.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.200]   So make it easy.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.360]   In fact, you can even set it up so that you're automatically
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.240]   invoicing and they're automatically paying every month.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:15.080]   Now, if they don't, they've got great follow-ups.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.320]   You could schedule them for 30, 60, 90 days.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.760]   They send late payment reminders.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.320]   That helps a lot.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.880]   It's very professional looking.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:26.320]   And by the way, they will print an invoice for those old-fashioned
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.960]   people who still want to print an invoice.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.320]   That's not a problem at all.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.000]   If you do time and expenses, it's great,
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.480]   because they will take-- they have an iPhone app that will
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.640]   automatically start, stop, start, stop.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.640]   Or you can do it on the web app, start, stop, and then
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.200]   automatically put some in the invoice.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.160]   It's great to getting data out of the invoice.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.600]   Your tax accountant will love you when it comes to tax time.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.360]   I liked it because I was billing Canada as well as the US.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.640]   It does currencies.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.080]   All the currencies, very easily.
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.000]   I'm just a big fan.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.160]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.520]   Visit freshbooks.com.

[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.240]   And should it come up?
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.360]   I don't think it will.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.720]   But I don't think they ask.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.400]   But if they do, imagine you're an unto it.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.960]   Say I are an unto it.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.560]   Very easy.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.120]   No obligation or no credit card required either.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.920]   30 days free, very simple.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:20.560]   Freshbooks.com, big fan of them.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:24.200]   And if your small business is not using it, you're missing out.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:27.920]   My audit is still in process on Twitter.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.120]   Has them in two hours.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.920]   It says done in about an hour ago.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.480]   Done in about an hour ago.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.560]   I don't know what that means.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:41.560]   Yeah, that's going to be good.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.520]   That's going to be good.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.840]   You're a glory and give us the results.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.680]   Back to the past.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.480]   So no, look, here's the deal.
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.800]   It's not a big deal, Kevin.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.120]   And it's not you that we're changing.
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.720]   I never-- have I ever met you before?
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:55.560]   No, you have not.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.160]   Which is why I took Umbridge to that tweet, by the way.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.520]   That's the only reason I've ever--
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.200]   publicly.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:00.880]   But it is.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:03.320]   If you say I'm tainted and your followers
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.520]   have no idea who I am, that would be talked
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:07.520]   about brand management earlier in the show.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:09.320]   That automatically puts a stigma upon me.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:09.840]   Right.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:10.840]   And that's what I understand.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.200]   I don't have to explain what's going on.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:12.960]   We do all right.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:13.960]   So somebody asked me--
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:14.960]   That's just some other time about that.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.800]   Somebody asked me-- no, we've got to do it now.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.440]   We started.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.280]   Somebody asked me-- and by the way,
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.040]   Callie really wants to know.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.600]   So somebody asked me on Twitter.
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.080]   Dying.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.520]   They asked me on Twitter.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.720]   Why don't you ever have Kevin Pereira or Adam Sessler on Twitter?
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.160]   And I said, because they're tainted by G4.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.160]   But not-- which is not-- I know Adam.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:34.680]   I love Adam.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.560]   It was not to say that I don't like these guys.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.960]   It was to say, I don't-- because you guys were
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.040]   the face of G4 for seven years, I didn't want
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.840]   to have anything to do with G4.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.800]   But we had a nice exchange offline and its direct messages.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:49.240]   Absolutely.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.360]   And you made me cry, because you said I was--
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:55.560]   I never meant to hurt you, Leo.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.400]   And that made me-- so I said, well, I'm so sorry.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.400]   I wasn't meaning to slander you in any way at all.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.920]   If anything, I was slandering G4.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.320]   By the way, so you left G4.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.760]   Why did you leave?
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.880]   Well, there's a myriad reasons.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:12.800]   But first and foremost, I've got my own personal projects
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.160]   going.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.680]   I have a new show coming out on Sci-Fi.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:17.120]   I'm hosting a new syndicated game show.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.880]   I've got a series coming out for an online thing.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:21.920]   Yeah, just super busy.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.880]   And to be honest, there was a little bit of fatigue
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.840]   of fighting a broken brand promise, which
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.560]   is something that was always an uphill battle
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.960]   for the network, from day one to the tech TV merger
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.760]   to today, when there's a new president and a reformatting
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:36.760]   and a rebranding.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.680]   And I didn't know that I had it in me
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:42.200]   to hang in there for another TV ambassador of another brand.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.320]   It's a very difficult, stressful process.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.960]   It's kind of a failed network, right?
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.760]   I mean, let's be honest.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:50.280]   Yeah, well, it depends on how you look at it.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.160]   It really does.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.800]   I mean, there's certain spreadsheets
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.280]   where it's absolutely successful.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:57.640]   There's a certain core audience where it has resonated.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.360]   They're reformatting yet again.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.520]   So that remains to be seen what will become of it.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:06.200]   I can tell you that that merger was bungled.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.760]   It was successful in the sense that it kept the lights on
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.800]   for a lot of people, a lot of good people.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:12.800]   Yeah, not me.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.680]   Not anybody I know, but yeah.
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:15.680]   Correct.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.640]   And to that point, I witnessed that bandaid getting ripped off
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:23.520]   and saw how tragic and how mishandled that merger was.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.280]   And it was painful to watch.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.680]   Yeah, actually, I didn't mean to be painful to be the face up.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.720]   I don't really-- yeah, and that's where I felt bad,
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.760]   because you got in the middle of it.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.960]   And look, you're working and you're trying to get a job.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:37.480]   It was a 24-year-old kid who was given a chance to host a show,
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.120]   by the way, that I was a huge fan of.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.160]   Somebody before it down.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.560]   Somebody gives you some news.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.440]   It was a dream job.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.880]   I'm standing in the same studio as Kevin Rose and Sarah Lane.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:45.880]   Right.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.800]   People that I used to admire and adore on television.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.240]   And now, they're my coworkers.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.680]   So for me, this was the greatest experience ever.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.200]   And then slowly, the wool was pulled down over my eyes.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:58.600]   And it became this thing that I was the ambassador of hate
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.840]   and change for a network that was mis-managing.
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:01.400]   Yeah, I've heard that.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.400]   That's where I really felt bad for you, actually.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.720]   When I heard you say that, it's like, oh, yeah,
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:07.280]   I'm sorry you got stuck in the middle of that.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.360]   But with that said, listen, I'm glad.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.200]   I'm really glad.
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:12.200]   And I appreciate the opportunity to come on your show
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.080]   and just sort of say hello, because I've always
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.200]   respected and admired you.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.280]   And I didn't take the tweet personally.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:19.440]   But I did--
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.960]   I think you understand why I had to get defensive
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.360]   in a public manner about that.
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.920]   Because for years--
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.320]   and maybe I'm hypersensitive to it.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.320]   But for years, I have fought the G4 stigma when, in reality,
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.680]   I was more, I think, tech TV at first,
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.760]   and quite an actual nerd who really appreciated
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.920]   what tech TV was doing.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.680]   So I had to speak up.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.160]   I feel like this is a tele-tubby,
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.360]   "Please moment."
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.000]   I'm not hugging him.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:43.720]   No.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:44.920]   Come on, total party, man.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:45.400]   Come play a--
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:46.400]   Plan a spooch on the model.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.240]   No, cuddle party.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.240]   No.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:48.760]   No.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:49.600]   But on this Portuguese TV--
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.640]   I have to say-- and I had--
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:54.720]   of course, I never intentionally never watched G4.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.840]   Never saw your work.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.240]   So I had no idea.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:00.120]   But I know many people who know you,
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.520]   including Kevin and Sarah, who say good things about you.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.440]   So I knew you were an ice guy.
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.320]   It wasn't really about that at all.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.960]   I just-- I didn't want the words G4 to show up on the way.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.000]   And that's all.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.120]   But because you're a great guy, and you're obviously
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:15.360]   you're impressive, you're very smart.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.840]   So I'm glad we had you on.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.800]   I mean, we'll have you back.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:18.360]   You're great.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:18.640]   Thank you.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.280]   I appreciate it.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:19.760]   It's an honor.
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:22.120]   And listen, I know you say you would have no desire
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:23.400]   to be at something like LeadUp.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:26.160]   But I'm telling you, it's a crossover crowd
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.600]   that has insane energy.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.840]   And you're more than welcome to come on and do a live
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.880]   Twitter or whatever you'd like from the show.
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.040]   We'd love to have you out there.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:33.800]   I think it'll be wild.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.120]   Maybe you can play with Epic Meal Time
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.320]   or Jam with Mike realm.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.080]   Sounds awesome.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.720]   You can give me the Diamond Dave app
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.640]   and you can trigger some all you has.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.920]   People should find out-- this is--
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.320]   I'm really going to be watching with interest.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.880]   It's a very interesting idea.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:47.360]   It's basically a nerd-lollap-looza.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.160]   Yeah, that's the hope.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.880]   I mean, the first one was-- there's footage
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.120]   on the site of our first one.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.000]   And we announced Grace Helbig is joining us as well.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:53.600]   So we've got--
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.600]   Who's that?
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.080]   --one of the--
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.120]   She is one of the most talented, funniest women
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:02.000]   I have ever met in my life, let alone people.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.080]   And she does a My Damn Channel show called The Daily Grace.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.240]   Where she improds daily about whatever.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.200]   And she is amazing and hilarious.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.480]   And we're going to put wireless GoPro cameras all over her body
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.040]   and send her out into the crowd to do some audience
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.160]   interaction for some games.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.960]   In addition to some other crazy stunts we have planned.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.520]   So it's going to be wild.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:22.960]   But I'd love to have you out if schedules permit.
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:25.720]   You're not coming to San Francisco, but--
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:26.600]   We'll fly you.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:27.560]   We'll take a care.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.960]   We'll put you up at a La Quinta Inn.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.400]   You'll get a continental breakfast.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.600]   I think I'll watch from a distance.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:34.240]   But thank you.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:34.800]   And good luck.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:36.480]   I see a crossbow in the guy's hand.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.880]   That's the only thing that worries me is the--
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:38.840]   A marshmallow crossbow.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:39.520]   Oh, it's marshmallow.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.440]   We also had parachuting twins coming out
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.640]   from the rafter at 65th.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.480]   Leah, you have no sense of adventure.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.920]   You wouldn't come skydiving with me,
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.760]   with the US Army gold knights.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.000]   You won't go to lead up.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.040]   We got to work on you.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.160]   You know, initially I said I would jump out of an airplane.
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.920]   And then I realized what I had said.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.080]   And I said, no, I'm not jumping out of an airplane.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.720]   I'm not nuts.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.360]   What do you think?
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.400]   I mean, I'm an old man.
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:04.920]   Look, you got to understand it's not good.
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.320]   It would break my ankle or something.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.000]   And I would be very bad.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.880]   You don't want to be there for that.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:10.760]   We're going to work on you.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:14.240]   We mentioned the sponsored stories settlement.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.440]   So Facebook got sued.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.240]   I just bugged me.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.440]   I remember I saw--
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.320]   I would get these ads.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.200]   Robert Scoble loves hair loss for men.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.200]   And I thought, does Robert know that they're using his name?
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:26.600]   I actually asked him on this show.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:28.520]   And he said, no.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:29.560]   These were the-- remember this?
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.520]   And in Facebook, you'd get a sponsored story that
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:35.960]   would say your friend likes this product.
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:42.240]   Facebook got sued over it and lost.
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.120]   And the proposed deal required Facebook
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.120]   to pay $10 million to the attorneys and $10 million
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:51.840]   to nonprofit groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.480]   A judge has said that's not enough.
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.640]   And I'd like to know what--
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:41:59.760]   --to the users?
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:00.600]   Yeah, no.
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.440]   A judge-- Richard Seaborg in San Francisco,
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.800]   a US district judge, has expressed skepticism
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:09.480]   about the settlement, rejected it yesterday,
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:13.320]   saying he has serious concerns and wonders,
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:16.880]   where'd that number come from?
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.080]   So I think it's good to hold Facebook's feet to the fire
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:20.960]   on this.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:23.200]   I thought it was pretty inappropriate, the sponsor's
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.640]   stories thing.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.160]   And it probably adds to the drop in Facebook.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:32.280]   Prices Facebook has said that the user controls the ability
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.640]   to opt out of it, which they have added,
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:40.280]   have costed $125 million in advertising revenue.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:43.360]   So by the way, I want to underscore that.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.760]   So Facebook initially just used your name.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.080]   They really didn't give you any control over it.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.160]   They lost $125 million when a judge said, no, no.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:56.640]   You have to let people opt out of this.
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:59.760]   That just shows you how much money there is in this kind
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.480]   of stealing of your identity that they do.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:07.080]   Is it stealing or is it something that we agree to with a 45-age
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:07.920]   terms of service?
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.440]   Interesting.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.600]   And then someone gets upset.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.960]   I'm sure buried in there somewhere.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:10.960]   Oh, sure.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.320]   They have a permission to do all that.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:12.840]   Oh, sure.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:13.560]   And you're right.
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.240]   It's not stealing because it's not identity theft.
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:17.120]   You're right.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:18.280]   They're doing something you agreed to.
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:19.560]   You just didn't know.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.400]   I think owning our social graph, our own personal graphs,
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.360]   is going to become a hotter topic in the near future,
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.680]   because there's different social networks that are trying to come
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.400]   about that give you permission to sell that.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:33.480]   My habits, my user data, my likes, my dislikes, that's me.
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:35.640]   So if you want to leverage that, I should be making the money
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.280]   off of it, not the site or the service.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:41.280]   And that might become a viable argument to switching to a new
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:44.200]   upcoming social network in the near future, depending upon who you are
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.560]   and how you want to manage your graph.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.640]   Or maybe if Facebook's smart, they would go to you and say, hey, Kevin,
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.360]   we'll give you a nickel for every like that gets clicked on or whatever.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.360]   Absolutely.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.360]   Partner project.
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.280]   You want to like this band and someone else discovers them because of you?
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.280]   Great.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:59.280]   Here's a kickback.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.280]   I think that's what's really scary and not too tangent.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.520]   I think it's somewhat related.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.640]   Is that a friend of mine went and looked at a career opportunities page for Facebook.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:09.080]   He's a coder and he was interested in getting hired there.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:12.600]   He just loaded the page, browsed through, and then left the page and moved on.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.600]   And within a day, he received a phone call from Facebook saying, hey, would you like to
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:18.600]   become a developer?
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.280]   We noticed you're looking at our careers page.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:21.280]   Wow.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:24.640]   I'm sure that again, in the terms of service, they're within their right to do that.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.920]   But if they're actively stalking that kind of stuff and then pulling out user data like
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:34.080]   a cell phone and calling a user because they browsed a page, that concerns me with what
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.520]   might happen in the near future and brands and products.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.520]   No, I agree with you.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.800]   I think it's happening all the time.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:47.360]   Isn't there a site that just came up that basically shows or kind of rates, terms of
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.360]   services through different?
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.360]   I saw that somewhere.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.560]   It's a really, yes, I do know a year.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:57.440]   It's like TOS didn't read TOS DR or something like that.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:02.240]   And they signed a raid to terms of services based on what licenses and rights they give
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:07.040]   the end user and what they can do with your content and how easy it is to opt out or get
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.040]   out of the site.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.240]   And it's nice because you can at a glance see that Twitter is orange or Twitpick is red
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:15.280]   because they can sell your photos that you tweet out.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:16.360]   It's a nice at a glance.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:21.160]   The thing is though, with some services, let's say Twitter or Facebook go red.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.960]   Are you really going to not use it because of that?
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.960]   True.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.960]   It's true.
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:28.720]   TOS dash DR dot info.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:34.360]   They say that the biggest lie on the web is I have read and agreed to the terms.
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:37.720]   Nobody, nobody reads these terms of service.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:38.720]   And you're right.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:46.680]   Twitpick is the lowest so far rated because your images become their property, which is
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:47.680]   creepy.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.520]   And they're the default image service for a lot of clients.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.000]   Yeah, this is a good, this is a really good idea.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.440]   I guess I hope it's lawyers.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.440]   I don't know who's who's doing this.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.320]   Well, if you if you expand any one of those agreements there, you'll see a little more
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:06.080]   plain English translation what their T.S. is in a translation.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:09.280]   So while it might be lawyers, I mean, I think you could look at the lines and just go,
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.080]   oh, you can understand what that saying.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.680]   You just didn't dig through 45 pages to find that line.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.680]   Right.
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:16.200]   Here, this is what you should read right here.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.760]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:18.760]   Great idea.
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:24.480]   This is where the web could really be a fantastic, valuable thing.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:26.600]   Even if it's not all garbage, Leo, there's hope for the.
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:28.480]   There's hope you've cheered me up.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.960]   You and lead up cheered me up.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:36.360]   Oh, I have it right here in front of me.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:40.480]   I was going to ask you about the Olympics, 150 million tweets.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.880]   Did you tweet the Olympics?
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:44.480]   Did you tweet it all about the Olympics either one of you?
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.480]   I barely knew what was going on.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:49.080]   Did you even watch the Olympics, Kelly?
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.440]   Well, I don't I don't have well, I could see you could have watched it online.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.440]   No, I didn't.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.880]   You don't have a TV, do you?
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:57.880]   I do not.
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:46:59.040]   I just don't watch enough TV.
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:02.880]   So I cut the cable a couple of years ago.
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.000]   But I guess you could watch it online.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000]   I don't really know.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000]   I wasn't paying any attention to the Olympics.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.280]   I knew a business to run and shows to produce.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.280]   So I feel bad.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:16.880]   I think despite NBC's best efforts, you could watch a lot of it online and catch the best
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:17.880]   time.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:18.880]   That's true.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:19.880]   That's true.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:20.880]   The internet told me what I needed to pay attention to.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.960]   The internet linked me to every clip that I need to know and every story that I wouldn't
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:27.560]   have known because of being censored by our broadcaster here.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.640]   So that was my Olympic experience.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:35.320]   The notion that they could cut away during the opening ceremonies into a Michael Phelps
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:36.640]   Ryan Seacrest interview.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.080]   Oh, that was so horrible.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.240]   The fact that they could do that.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.320]   Like, could you imagine had another had the BBC or Channel 4 done that during a 9/11
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.520]   tribute?
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.320]   Could you imagine the uproar and yet NBC was like, I wasn't tailored to an American audience.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:53.120]   When a Chinese fencer is crying on the stand because she doesn't want to leave, she's been
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:58.240]   wronged because of an intern, a volunteer, 16 year old timekeeper robbed her from winning
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.240]   a match.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.920]   And you don't know about that unless you use Reddit or Twitter.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.920]   That's a travesty.
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:03.920]   I agree.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:04.920]   So I agree.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.080]   But it's also the Olympics.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.480]   So I don't care.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.720]   What happened with online?
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:12.640]   I should have really led with this story because this is a very bizarre story.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.520]   I don't know if you're.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.840]   So online initially, and they've been around for a couple of years.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.600]   I remember seeing him at E3 two years ago.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:23.080]   And then again, last year, the idea was you'd be able to use their.
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:27.400]   They were the most popular servers to play high end video games, even on low end hardware,
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:30.160]   like a tablet or just one of their online devices.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.200]   Because all the work was being done on the server.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.400]   And then it was a clever idea if it worked.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:35.400]   And it did seem to work.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.800]   There was some latency, but it worked pretty well.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.800]   But it mustn't have been doing well because then they did a little pivot and they created
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.600]   the online desktop, which all of a sudden was a way that you could use windows and
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:53.600]   office on your desktop compute, or me on your iPad or your Android tablet, which was very
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.600]   different.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.400]   Same technology, but very.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:59.240]   I mean, that's to me, it look at what O2 is doing.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:00.480]   Look at what online is doing.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:04.400]   Guy Kai or guy, who I believe there's a bunch of services doing cloud rendering and it makes
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.400]   sense.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.400]   Like we're going to laugh.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.560]   But weren't these guys the first processors and all these devices?
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.640]   We're going to laugh in five years time.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.600]   Let it be rendered in the cloud and as long as speeds are fast enough and you're not
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.120]   past your Verizon four gig band with allotment for the month, you'll stream it in 1080p
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:18.440]   to whatever thin client there is.
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:21.440]   You just need 60 frames a second at that resolution, but you're right.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.120]   They had to pivot because they thought, well, gaming, that's going to be the killer app,
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.840]   but they couldn't secure the games or the controllers to really wrap up an experience
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:33.200]   that was as captivating as a PC or a dedicated gaming.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.200]   Interesting.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.200]   So that's what happened.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:37.200]   That's what happened.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.200]   And look, hindsight's 20/20.
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:43.440]   If I was on live, I would have done touchscreen gaming applications for bars and licensed out.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.440]   Think of the way bars have.
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:45.440]   The trivia things that they do.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:46.440]   They do.
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.960]   I would have done play any game you want or a cyber cafe instead of a cyber cafe having
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.960]   to do 40 machines so people can play Diablo three.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.760]   They can do 40 e-machines or thin clients and just license the technology from on live
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.760]   and get it there.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.960]   But I'm sure there were license agreements that got in the way of that.
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:03.960]   Steve Perlman, the guy who found it, very smart guy, did Web TV.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:10.280]   He was a very brilliant entrepreneur, had done work in this field before.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:18.000]   So what happened was that basically they, everybody was saying, "Oh, well, they are
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.440]   going under their, all their employees are getting fired that day.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:27.160]   I think it was two days ago, maybe Friday, I think."
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:33.400]   And so the employees were saying they were being cut and let go and all I was dead.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:39.320]   But in reality, what actually happened was that they're being, they're going bankrupt
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:44.960]   and they're getting bought by another company as a different entity.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:46.200]   By a guy.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.200]   A single guy.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.200]   By one person.
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:56.520]   It seems to me that this is all kind of pre-planned and this whole acquisition is just
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:59.840]   meant to kind of get out of the bankruptcy essentially.
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:04.360]   So there's some information that's recently come out.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.600]   This is from computer and video games.com.
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:14.680]   Steve Perlman apparently said the problem was the servers that in order to make online
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:20.280]   work, we had to have enough servers for the peak number of users.
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:24.400]   He said we literally bought thousands of servers and all the equipment and the network
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:25.680]   to go with it.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:31.280]   We had plenty of them, plenty of bandwidth, but we didn't have enough users to get cash
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.280]   flow positive.
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:37.080]   He says, "If you've got 8,000 servers and 1,600 users, how are you ever going to make
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.080]   money?"
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:40.480]   Now he's talking about concurrent users.
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:43.880]   Yeah, servers are super expensive.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:51.080]   They had to have spent a lot of money on that and the whole cloud processing.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.880]   That's a huge sense.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:59.680]   So they basically, it sounds like they burned through every penny that they've got.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:06.560]   Maybe they anticipated more than they actually could get more users than they could get on
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:07.560]   board.
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:09.600]   Now they did hire back.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:16.640]   Most of the large portion was the quote of their employees through the other company.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.640]   They've kind of gone through this.
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:19.640]   That's the trend.
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:20.640]   Fire and rehire.
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:27.160]   After the Transcontinental Railroad was built, most of those companies went bankrupt.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:31.160]   Even though the Transcontinental railroads are a great idea and obvious way to make money,
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.200]   then the short term, they couldn't.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:37.760]   It may just be that on live, as you said, Kevin, was bad timing.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:41.560]   They were in the right place, but the timing wasn't right.
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:44.000]   The first wave crashes the hardest.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.200]   They're the early adopters and so were their customers and unfortunately that might have
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.600]   been too much too soon.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.200]   Maybe now they'll scale back and rethink.
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:56.000]   But I've used on live before and had been thoroughly impressed by the experience.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.880]   As a gaming platform, there's one thing.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.880]   Online is great.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:01.880]   As a video platform, as a social viewing platform, as a VOD platform.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.520]   Oh, you've used it like that.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:04.520]   Yeah, because you can.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:09.040]   I mean, look, you could press a button on live and it would zoom you out to show you
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:13.600]   a hundred concurrent video streams of live people, live playing.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:14.960]   You could tap on anyone.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:18.840]   It would zoom in full screen, high def, and you could press a button and launch the game
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:20.000]   they were too.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.600]   So imagine that for a cool viewing.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.920]   Imagine that for all the live streams that are happening on various online video platforms
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:26.920]   like this one.
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:28.920]   Someone could just tap zoom in if they want to watch the show.
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:30.160]   They're watching as well.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.160]   Tap zoom out.
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:35.560]   And every other show being broadcast related to that, that's the power of cloud rendering.
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:40.400]   It's not going to drain any extra power from the processor of this or from your computer,
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.160]   but the problem is that it did require thousands of servers and they didn't hit that critical
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.160]   mass point.
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.440]   So tell the truth, Kevin, it was you that bought it, wasn't it?
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:49.440]   The live system?
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:54.940]   No, unfortunately, I gave it a great review on attack of the show based off its future
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:55.940]   promise.
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:54:01.740]   It had a much less polite review for its current existence.
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:02.740]   You killed it.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:03.740]   I did not.
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.740]   I was honest about it.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:05.740]   You killed it.
[01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:06.740]   I was honest about it.
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.620]   I really, I think in a few years time it could be a fantastic technology.
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:13.020]   Just as all these cloud based renderers are, I think that's where we're heading.
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.700]   It's just a little cost prohibitive right now.
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:19.180]   I think actually you nailed it that it was it's a brilliant idea.
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:20.180]   It was a little laggy.
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.020]   I mean, there were some potential problems with it, but.
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:25.180]   We're gaining that was a huge issue, but for media consumption, for hangouts, for video
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:26.180]   shots, fine.
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.180]   Like it was great.
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:28.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:29.340]   And I think you're right.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:34.580]   I think they are, I hope you're right that they'll scale back and kind of regroup.
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:39.340]   Unfortunately, in the process, a lot of the employees or some employees lost their jobs
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:42.180]   and everyone lost stock in the company.
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:47.300]   So if that means anything anyway, Pearlman said that the guy, he wouldn't say who bought
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:51.740]   it, but he said the guy who bought it is an extraordinary guy and a very accomplished
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:55.660]   and well known venture capitalist, very wealthy.
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:59.620]   These are quotes from the meeting that he had, the all hands meeting he had on Friday,
[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:01.620]   I guess somebody leaked.
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:06.460]   And as and Pearlman is of the opinion that on live is quote, the entire future of everything
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:11.740]   or at least the buyer believes that I'm sorry, the buyer believes that, but couldn't afford
[01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:15.180]   to rehire all of the 200 people that online employed.
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:19.820]   So that's why the layoffs, they I think they rehire they rehired maybe a quarter of the
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:20.820]   total.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.900]   Everyone in the chat room is speculating.
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:23.900]   It's Kevin Rose.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:25.900]   Kevin Rose bottom.
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:26.900]   I think it's Kim.com.
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:27.900]   Kim.com.
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:28.900]   That'd be good.
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:33.660]   Or, but he basically made it sound like on live is the next Zombo calm.
[01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.500]   Do you guys remember Zombo?
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:36.500]   No.
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:37.500]   Z-O-M-B-O dot com.
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:41.340]   One of the first great flash websites ever that still exists today.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:46.140]   And it promises that you can do anything at Zombo calm, the infinite as unknown at Zombo
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:50.100]   calm and it's a looping flash animation with silly circus noise that just promises everything.
[01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:51.100]   It's brilliant.
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:52.100]   And that's it.
[01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:53.100]   Z-O-M-B-O dot com.
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.100]   It's still a rest.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:55.100]   It's entertaining.
[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:56.100]   Oh yeah, it's brilliant.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:57.100]   Best website's ever.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.100]   Welcome.
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:55:59.100]   There it is.
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:00.100]   This is Zombo calm.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:01.100]   Welcome.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:02.100]   Is it loading?
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:03.100]   This is Zombo calm.
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:04.100]   Welcome to Zombo calm.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:05.100]   You can do anything at Zombo calm.
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:06.100]   Anything at all.
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:07.100]   The only thing that's in the chat room is that you can do anything at Zombo calm.
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:14.100]   This is Zombo calm.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:19.100]   Anything at all.
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:24.100]   The only limit is yourself.
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:29.100]   Welcome to Zombo calm.
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:32.100]   Welcome to Zombo calm.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.100]   I can't believe this is still online.
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:34.100]   It's still up.
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:35.100]   It's been up for years.
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:38.100]   I mean, this was the first Flash night making fun of the dot com bubble.
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:40.100]   It's like, yeah, Zombo can do anything.
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:41.100]   Welcome.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.100]   He's getting more excited.
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:43.100]   He's agitated.
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:46.100]   This is Zombo calm.
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:48.100]   The only limit is yourself in the concept.
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:53.100]   Welcome to you who have come to Zombo calm.
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:57.100]   I want to see the stats on how long people actually stand at.
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:59.100]   Well, it's still changing.
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:00.100]   It's not done.
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:04.100]   You can do anything at Zombo calm.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:07.100]   I'm going to let it run Chad Potter down.
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:08.100]   It's infinite.
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:09.100]   It's infinite.
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:11.100]   See, see, see, it's changing.
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:16.100]   The unattainable is unknown at Zombo calm.
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:19.100]   Welcome to Zombo calm.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.100]   You boys are so simple.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:26.100]   Esparo in a chat room says he let it run on a co-workers computer for two weeks.
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:28.100]   Oh my God.
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:30.100]   The infinite is a...
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:31.100]   It's a table.
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:33.100]   It's a table at Zombo calm.
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:36.100]   That's what that founder said about on live.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:37.100]   It's the future of everything.
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:38.100]   Yeah, it's some.
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:43.100]   But I kind of agree that cloud-based rendering and streaming to thin clients is the future of everything.
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:46.100]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:49.100]   Why is it such a great idea?
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:52.100]   Because the hardware then on our end doesn't have to be so good.
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:55.100]   Yeah, because we don't have to upgrade something like this ever again.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:58:00.100]   As long as it receives a signal from a server that you can upgrade user interfaces.
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:01.100]   There's no software updates.
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:02.100]   All your software is currently up to date.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:09.100]   You can go to any client, sit down at a computer at a hotel or at a cyber-canafe or even at a Starbucks.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:14.100]   And as long as your profile and everything's in the cloud being rendered there, it's the exact same experience.
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:16.100]   Sans input device potentially.
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:17.100]   But it's the exact same experience everywhere.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:20.100]   You don't have to buy new devices because they have faster processors.
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:23.100]   All that's handled in the cloud and updated there.
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:24.100]   Yeah.
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:25.100]   And right now it's early.
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:26.100]   I mean, it's clearly early.
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:31.100]   But in a few years time, you know, that's I think that's where we're heading.
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:32.100]   Interesting.
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:33.100]   Well, obviously you're not alone.
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:36.100]   Some very wealthy guy feels exactly the same.
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:37.100]   Douglas Zombo.
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:39.100]   It's the Zombo.
[01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:40.100]   The end is...
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:42.100]   This is Zombo.
[01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:46.100]   And welcome to you who have come to Zombo.
[01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:49.100]   On live can do anything.
[01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:51.100]   It's possible.
[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:52.100]   And Zombo gone.
[01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:53.100]   Oh, Lauren.
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:54.100]   All right.
[01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:55.100]   We're going to take a break.
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:56.100]   Callie Lewis is here.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.100]   Geekbeat.tv.
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:58.100]   God, this is a long show.
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:00.100]   I'm going to just do a quick add.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:06.500]   Well, you know, and you know, before we even do that, I think we have to run the promo because
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:07.500]   we have a promo.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:08.500]   We like to do this.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:11.380]   This is something new we've started to do because it turned out nobody knew that we did
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:13.940]   anything else on this network.
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:17.300]   So we are actually, we do a lot more on this network than just this show.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.300]   Take a look.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.300]   Live with man.
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:20.300]   This is...
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:21.300]   Oh, this is going to happen.
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:22.300]   Live with.
[01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:23.300]   You have to kill Zombo Cobb.
[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:24.300]   Oh, you mean you can't play it?
[01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:25.300]   No.
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:32.300]   It's on the Tricaster, remember?
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.300]   Zombo Cobb will continue.
[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:36.300]   Zombo Cobb will always continue because...
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:39.300]   I think you have to redo your promo.
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:40.300]   Your promo.
[01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:41.300]   Wait a minute.
[01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:42.300]   Zombo has a newsletter.
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:43.300]   Welcome to Zombo Cobb.
[01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:48.300]   I don't know how I got that, but I click something and it says there's a newsletter.
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:49.300]   Sign up.
[01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:50.300]   Oh, man.
[01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:53.300]   That brings me to the stream joy that plays.
[01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:54.300]   Okay.
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:56.300]   Screw the promo.
[01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:58.300]   Here's the actual promo.
[01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:59.300]   Go, go, go.
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:00.300]   He's twig.
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:01.300]   And that's F.W.
[02:00:01.300 --> 02:00:06.300]   Holy physical copy of the Diamond Club.
[02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:07.300]   And pause that.
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:08.300]   Wait a minute.
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:09.300]   Wait a minute.
[02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:12.460]   Because I don't think people are going to see what's going on in the background as Justin
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:16.860]   Robert Young is announcing the hard copy of Diamond Club.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:20.100]   Scroll that back a little bit and look over his right shoulder.
[02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:22.620]   Go back a little bit.
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:23.620]   What is that?
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:24.620]   What is going on there?
[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:26.620]   Just tell me what's going on.
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:27.620]   Someone's going on Super Saiyan.
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:28.620]   Well, I was...
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:32.380]   Well, that's me.
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:35.060]   And I happen to be dying my hair at the time.
[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:37.900]   Are you a fan of the Mohawk man and that says JPL?
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:38.900]   What is that?
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:42.420]   Well, they, you know, there was actually a...
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:45.860]   We came up with a OMG Raptor.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:49.420]   I was a little bit of a dinosaur raptor.
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:50.420]   Dina Raptor.
[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:52.020]   And it freaked Justin out.
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:54.020]   So, you know, we got that.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:58.020]   I wish that you guys could give Promos carefully because there's stuff, all sorts of...
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:02.020]   The most telling part of that frame was the fact that his workstation is covered in plastic.
[02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:03.020]   Well...
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:05.500]   Now you explained that on the hair dye, but I think that maybe...
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:06.580]   Are you glazing the homeroa?
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:07.580]   What's going on?
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:08.580]   Do you want to have a little more self-tro?
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:09.580]   Lazy the homeroa.
[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:10.580]   Alright.
[02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:13.580]   Let's see the rest of the promo.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:15.580]   This is a twist.
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:16.580]   And as if so.
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:17.580]   Oh Lord.
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:18.580]   Holy f*ck!
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:19.580]   Look at that!
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:21.940]   Oh, the diamond club.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:22.940]   This is...
[02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:23.940]   Are you kidding me?
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:24.940]   This is absolutely a myth.
[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:25.940]   This is everything we wanted.
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:26.940]   Are you kidding?
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:27.940]   Look at the chat room.
[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:28.940]   Dude, they're freaking out.
[02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:29.940]   So there we go.
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:30.940]   Oh my God.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:31.940]   We have them.
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:32.940]   Oh, this is so cool.
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:33.940]   Oh!
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:34.940]   Oh!
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:35.940]   Oh!
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:36.940]   Oh!
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:39.740]   Before you buy, the budget portable is hard to kill.
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:43.380]   You take and turn shooting at it with a shotgun.
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:49.420]   Smashing into the floor and shooting bolts of lightning into the drive.
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:50.420]   Home theater geeks.
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:56.300]   So now you can watch it in 3D on any 2D set or projector.
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:57.300]   So you don't need to go on 5-1?
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:59.660]   So the display doesn't need a display itself.
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:02.660]   Does not need to be a 3D capable display?
[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:03.660]   Exactly.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:04.660]   Gizwiz.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:06.660]   And don't take an aisle seat.
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:07.660]   Oh!
[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:08.660]   Oh, can I get out?
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.340]   I have to go on the bathroom so bad.
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:12.140]   I'll just deflate my pillow.
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:13.620]   Let me get the flamethrower.
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:18.500]   If you missed this week on Twitch, you missed a lot.
[02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.220]   We will be reviewing.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:22.780]   I got them today.
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:28.020]   What are they called the Orbit Wheels roller skates?
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:30.620]   So we do a new segment on the Gizwiz.
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:33.860]   It's called Crap I Found on Sky Mall.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:34.860]   Oh, yes.
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:35.860]   Yes.
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:36.860]   Yes.
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:37.860]   Yes.
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:38.860]   And this is the...
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:42.260]   We're letting the audience vote on what it is that they...
[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:43.780]   And these are the Orbit Wheels.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:45.940]   You see, you put them on your feet.
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:51.060]   So I will be doing that my review live on the Gizwiz.
[02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:52.900]   Stalk and segue just tanked.
[02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:55.140]   That looks like the future of transparent.
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:56.140]   Forget that.
[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:57.140]   This is it.
[02:02:57.140 --> 02:02:59.860]   This is going to change how cities are built.
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:03.740]   I hope you could review the little dog stairs that lead up to the bed next.
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:04.740]   Exactly.
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:06.740]   A 4-foot-tall Yeti statue for your backyard.
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:07.740]   Yeah.
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:08.740]   Well, that pillow is the next thing.
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:10.060]   I ordered that.
[02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:13.500]   And then we're waiting to see what the vote is on the next object.
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:15.980]   That's...Yeah, Crap we found on Sky Mall.
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:18.300]   You won't go skydiving because you think you're going to break your ankle.
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:19.300]   You're going to strap those things on.
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:20.300]   I was thinking the same thing, Kevin.
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:21.860]   I hope you have great health insurance later.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:24.180]   I'm not jumping out of a plane, I'm on ground.
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.180]   This week in HMOs.
[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:26.180]   That's the next joke.
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:28.500]   How bad could it be?
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.500]   Our show brought to you...
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:30.500]   Do you...
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:31.500]   You must listen to Audible books.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:32.500]   Do you listen to Audible?
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:33.500]   Yeah.
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:34.500]   I do indeed.
[02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:35.500]   And I know...
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:37.700]   I also love that they support a thousand of podcasts that I love.
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:38.700]   I think they're great.
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:39.700]   They support them all.
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:40.700]   Every one of them, including ours.
[02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:41.700]   This is yours.
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:42.700]   This is yours.
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:43.700]   Yeah.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:45.740]   All right, well, can we give out my code for this show?
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.900]   Yes, I wouldn't do that to you, Leo.
[02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:48.900]   Don't worry.
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:49.900]   I got a host.
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:50.900]   I can't remember who it was.
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:54.060]   I had somebody, a guest on the show, who gave out their code on the show.
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.060]   That's ridiculous.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:04:00.060]   Like they said something like audiblepodcast.com/omgcraft.
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.060]   Yes, I'm like that.
[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:04.260]   I'm getting that won't work.
[02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:05.260]   Do you have it?
[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:06.260]   No, I don't have one.
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:07.820]   We should get you one.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:08.820]   Chats Show debuted.
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:09.820]   OMGcraft.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:11.620]   That should be in the promo.
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.780]   No, it should be in the promo.
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:16.340]   He does a show about Minecraft now.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.340]   What do you do?
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:22.940]   Well, the first episode we showed off Redstone.
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:26.100]   You know, the normal stuff.
[02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:28.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:29.820]   It's an 8-bit video game.
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:30.860]   It's taking the world by storm.
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:33.100]   I don't understand it.
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:35.180]   It's like virtual Legos.
[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:37.220]   Yeah, but not.
[02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:39.620]   But not even close.
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:42.620]   So we all love audible.
[02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:44.020]   So that's established.
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:45.740]   I just finished the stand.
[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:47.300]   That was kind of a slog.
[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:49.860]   That was 48 hours of Stephen King.
[02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:50.860]   There's a lot.
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:53.260]   So now I'm shopping for my new book.
[02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:54.660]   I'm excited.
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:55.660]   Maybe you guys can give me a recommendation.
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:05:00.540]   The one thing that happens when people listen to audible, when you get together you go,
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:01.540]   "Oh, what's good?
[02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:02.540]   What have you listened to lately?"
[02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:03.540]   Because there's 100,000 books.
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:04.540]   There's a lot of different choices.
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:07.780]   And there's so many wonderful books to choose from.
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:09.340]   It's hard to pick up.
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:10.980]   I don't know if the dirt is on there.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:11.980]   I should probably see it.
[02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:12.980]   Let me look.
[02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:14.620]   What's the dirt about?
[02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:18.580]   It's the real story of what went on behind the scenes with Motley Crew.
[02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:20.060]   And it is gripping.
[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:21.060]   Wow.
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:24.220]   It's very explicit and it's incredibly gripping.
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:28.420]   What this band did, not only to become the rock stars that they became, but also what
[02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:30.900]   they did to fans backstage, it's wild.
[02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:32.620]   I love that kind of book.
[02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:33.860]   I have to say, I'm a big fan.
[02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:35.900]   What they did to fans backstage.
[02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:37.460]   Yeah, well, you can only imagine.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:38.460]   They do not.
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:45.060]   There's not yet a, there's not yet a lass, an audible version of that.
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:46.060]   I don't know if the world's ready.
[02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:47.060]   I'm going to read the book and how it's all.
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:48.060]   Would you do it for them?
[02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:49.380]   I'll absolutely read their book.
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:50.380]   Are you kidding me?
[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:51.380]   I love it.
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:52.380]   It's fantastic.
[02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:53.380]   That would be good.
[02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:54.380]   Kevin Prerer, reading.
[02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:55.380]   Have you ever read any audio books?
[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:56.380]   Have you ever done that?
[02:05:56.380 --> 02:05:57.860]   I have and I've never actually read a real physical book.
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:00.020]   So I have a long way to go.
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:05.660]   I will give you a recommendation for if you want a rock and roll biography that is absolutely
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:06.660]   fantastic.
[02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.660]   Did you ever read Keith Richards book Life?
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:11.140]   Oh, man, is this good.
[02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:12.460]   They have it on a bridge down audible.
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:13.460]   Highly recommended.
[02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:14.820]   You know, it's the Rolling Stones.
[02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:18.220]   It's not, you know, there's no mud sharks or anything involved.
[02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:21.580]   It's not wild, but it's the true story.
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:23.460]   And he really is great in this book.
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:24.460]   It's fantastic.
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:25.460]   That's available.
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:26.460]   You could get that.
[02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.460]   That could be your audible book.
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:29.460]   I'm looking at mud shark on the urban dictionary.
[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:30.460]   Yeah, go ahead.
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:33.460]   You can find out more about mud sharks on the internet.
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:34.460]   Go to your library.
[02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:37.460]   Yeah, definitely.
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:38.460]   Maybe it was.
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.460]   You got our urban dictionary.
[02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:42.460]   Don't call it a friendly.
[02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:43.460]   How about you, Callie?
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:45.100]   Because we get two books, by the way.
[02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:51.060]   This is you when you go to audible.com/twit2, you'll be signing up for the platinum account,
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.540]   which is two books a month.
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:54.260]   First month's free.
[02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:57.380]   First two credits are free.
[02:06:57.380 --> 02:06:58.740]   That means you can get two books.
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:06:59.780]   Cancel anytime pay nothing.
[02:06:59.780 --> 02:07:01.180]   So I got another book.
[02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:02.180]   You got another.
[02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:04.740]   What do you like to listen to?
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:06.140]   You know, I haven't.
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:08.980]   I have a bunch of stuff in my queue.
[02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:12.900]   And I'm not remembering any of them off the top of my head.
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.060]   I need to load another one.
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:15.060]   I got one for you.
[02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:16.060]   It wasn't just something.
[02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:19.500]   But I was wondering if they have the Abe Lincoln vampire hunter thing?
[02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:20.860]   Yes, of course they have that.
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:21.860]   Okay.
[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:22.860]   Did you see the movie?
[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:23.860]   Was that any good?
[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:25.700]   Was that movie any good?
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:27.100]   I didn't see the movie.
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:28.100]   I'm the one.
[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:31.500]   Do you ever leave your room at all?
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:34.540]   I get yelled at when I tell the truth.
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:35.380]   So I'm not going to answer that.
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:37.220]   You never go out to you.
[02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:43.260]   You sit there with your katana sword and just wish you had a life.
[02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:45.460]   Yeah, Abe Lincoln vampire hunter.
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:46.620]   That's whole series.
[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:49.860]   You know, that started with what was it?
[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:52.860]   The first one was it Jane Eyre or something like that?
[02:07:52.860 --> 02:07:57.060]   Anyway, yes, this would be there's a whole series of these pride and prejudice.
[02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:58.060]   That was it.
[02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:59.300]   Pride and prejudice with zombies.
[02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:00.300]   Remember that?
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:01.900]   I didn't hear about that one.
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:02.900]   Oh, yeah.
[02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:06.900]   Now with ultra violent zombie mayhem, it's kind of a new Jane Austen.
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:07.900]   Wow.
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:08.900]   Yeah.
[02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:09.820]   Anyway, that's in the same.
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:10.820]   I think it's the same author.
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:13.140]   It is Seth Graham Smith.
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:15.820]   He's made a living doing this.
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:16.820]   That'd be good.
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:17.820]   Two good ones too.
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:24.060]   If you like to mix American history with the super occult, the super natural.
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:26.700]   Anyway, go to audible.com/twit2.
[02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:27.860]   You could play it on any device.
[02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:31.100]   I've got the audible app on my galaxy.
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:35.100]   I love it on my Android phone, but it works on the iPhone and Windows phone too.
[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:37.300]   Audible.com/twit2.
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:43.180]   They're waiting for you to pick the book of your dreams too.
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:46.900]   President Obama says to the Mars Curiosity team, I was thinking about getting the Mohawk
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:49.300]   myself.
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:50.300]   I like that.
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:51.700]   You know, Mohawk guy, right?
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:52.700]   Yeah.
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:53.700]   Yeah.
[02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:54.700]   Yeah.
[02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:55.700]   Good on him.
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:56.700]   Good on him and NASA.
[02:08:56.700 --> 02:08:57.700]   That was a great moment.
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:08:58.700]   It was a fantastic moment.
[02:08:58.700 --> 02:08:59.700]   Beautiful.
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:00.700]   Oh, I'd be happy.
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:01.700]   Maybe you really need that.
[02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:02.700]   We need more of that.
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:04.700]   We need more of that in this world.
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:05.700]   Yeah.
[02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:07.700]   More of Mohawks or special numbers?
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:08.700]   No, no.
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.700]   Things landing on Mars.
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:10.700]   Right.
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:16.260]   Failing around science, scientific accomplishments and human endeavors versus, you know, I don't
[02:09:16.260 --> 02:09:20.100]   want to make it political or get on a soapbox, but it's kind of hard not to when, you know,
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:24.180]   you spend billions of dollars in UAVs that blow up hospitals and, you know, kill millions.
[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:27.540]   When I look, I think it's way cooler that they landed a Humvee on Mars.
[02:09:27.540 --> 02:09:28.540]   Absolutely.
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:30.700]   That has real time high death feeds for a fraction of the price.
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:32.020]   I think more good is going to come.
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.020]   Could not agree more.
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:34.020]   Could not agree more.
[02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:35.900]   You know what on that note?
[02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:36.900]   Let's just stop.
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:40.540]   Let's just stop because I think this is just a great show and we've and we've really kind
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.540]   of gone way long and.
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:43.540]   Okay, Mike.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:44.540]   He just left.
[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:46.980]   He walked away.
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:49.700]   I would have dropped the mic, but I like this microphone too much.
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:51.420]   I couldn't Chris Rocky.
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:53.540]   Great to have you.
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:54.540]   Kevin Pereira.
[02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:55.540]   So nice to see you.
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:57.180]   Great to meet you for the first time.
[02:09:57.180 --> 02:09:58.180]   You will be back.
[02:09:58.180 --> 02:09:59.180]   You're fantastic.
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:00.180]   Smart guy.
[02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:05.900]   And I really appreciate your putting up with me and my shenanigans on the Twitter.
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:06.900]   That was fun.
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:07.900]   That was fun.
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:08.900]   Come on.
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:09.900]   That was a good Internet flame war.
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:14.460]   And what came out of it is that I discovered that you're going to be joining us at lead
[02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:15.460]   up and that's huge.
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:16.460]   I didn't expect you were going to.
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:17.460]   You're running.
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:20.140]   You're running the Zombocom of podcast.
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:21.140]   Oh, Zombocom.
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:23.100]   I can't wait to have you at lead up.
[02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:28.100]   You did mention Zombocom.
[02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:29.100]   All right.
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:30.860]   It's definitely time for me to leave now.
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:33.220]   Callie Lewis, geekbeat.tv.
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:34.860]   You got a lot of ventures going on.
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:35.860]   Not just geekbeat.
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:37.620]   You're keeping really busy.
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:38.620]   Are you all right?
[02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:39.620]   Are you exhausted?
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:40.620]   No, I'm good.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:41.620]   I'm good.
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:42.620]   I'm having fun, you know.
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:45.220]   And are you ever going to use your real name again?
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:48.660]   Are you now officially Callie Lewis for the world?
[02:10:48.660 --> 02:10:49.660]   You know what?
[02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:50.660]   It's interesting.
[02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:57.500]   It's because over the years, people have known me or met me as Callie Lewis.
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:59.180]   And so they just call me that.
[02:10:59.180 --> 02:11:05.580]   I like my friends call me that nobody else out of my family uses that real name.
[02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:08.740]   I'm going to call you Luria from now on because I love you.
[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:09.980]   That'll confuse a lot of people.
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:11.420]   It's a great name.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:14.380]   People don't know that Callie was just a made up character.
[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:19.340]   Callie Lewis was playing years ago, but it got a life of its own.
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:21.220]   And now you are Callie Lewis.
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.220]   Yeah.
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:25.620]   Yeah, you know, it's not a stage name by any means.
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:26.900]   I mean, well, it is a stage name.
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:30.180]   It's not like a role or anything like that.
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:31.180]   It's just me.
[02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:36.540]   It was a name because my heart, my name is really hard for people to pronounce.
[02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:37.980]   Luria Petrucci.
[02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:43.260]   And it was just something I decided to do on the onset of starting these online videos
[02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:44.260]   that I do.
[02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:45.260]   Gosh, I love it.
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:46.260]   It's been a years ago.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:47.260]   You've become Callie Lewis.
[02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:51.540]   And you only have 20 characters left on a tweet if you used your real name.
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:54.060]   Yeah, Luria Petrucci is from a message.
[02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:55.660]   It's really long.
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:57.260]   Well, everybody loves Callie.
[02:11:57.260 --> 02:11:59.460]   You're just the greatest and I'm glad you're doing so well.
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:03.420]   You've got Tip of Day, you've got Geekbeat Live and of course Geekbeat.tv.
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:05.380]   Find it all at Geekbeat.tv.
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:08.060]   Great to see you again, Callie.
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:09.060]   You too.
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:10.060]   I love you.
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:11.060]   See you soon.
[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:12.060]   Let us know when you're up here, OK?
[02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:13.060]   Oh, right.
[02:12:13.060 --> 02:12:14.060]   You never leave.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:15.980]   So I never see you again.
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:16.980]   You're coming out Monday?
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:20.860]   Yeah, I got a pack up and head on out there to say I'm going to finish this.
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:22.900]   I've got a bunch of meetings.
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:23.900]   Well, have fun.
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:24.900]   All right.
[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:25.900]   Have a good time.
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:28.900]   Hopefully I can hopefully I can come up.
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:29.900]   I don't know.
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:30.900]   I'm pretty packed.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:33.020]   And Petaluma, you're so far away.
[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:34.820]   Oh, but I'll try.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:35.820]   That's hysterical.
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:37.140]   I didn't realize that.
[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:38.140]   I know.
[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:39.420]   It kind of came up.
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:40.420]   Well, good.
[02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:41.420]   We'll have a nice trip.
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.420]   Thanks.
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:43.420]   Great to see you.
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:44.420]   Kevin, Callie.
[02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:45.420]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:46.420]   We do twit.
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:48.900]   This is a two hour twit.
[02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:51.260]   We do two and a half, two hours and 10 minutes.
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:57.340]   We do twit normally 3 p.m. Pacific every Sunday afternoon, 6 p.m. Eastern time 2200
[02:12:57.340 --> 02:12:59.380]   UTC on twit.tv.
[02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:02.580]   If you watch live, bring lunch.
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:06.540]   But if you don't, you know, the nice thing about this show is it'll last you all week.
[02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:11.740]   It's like, you know, you can just chew on it all week long.

[02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:17.500]   podcasts are stored.
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:18.500]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:20.020]   We really appreciate it.
[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:21.420]   And we'll see you next week.
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:23.460]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:25.460]   This is the game.
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:28.780]   And the live audience is all going to run to the bathroom now.
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:29.780]   Do it in the twit.
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:30.780]   All right.
