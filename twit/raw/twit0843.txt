[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.120]   gets confused. Watch what happens next. And a pickup truck with a built-in kitchen? We'll
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.840]   have a first look. It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.800]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. I just scared the panel. I think by telling you this
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.840]   is going to be a long show. It's not. It's not. I promise. It's going to be a normal,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   normal sized show. Great to have you Denise Howell back in. Well, I wish it was in studio,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.460]   but back in the show, internet lawyer, of course, former host, longtime host of this
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.260]   week in law. Great to see you Denise. Things going well. Thanks. You too. Things are going
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.640]   great. How's your new clothing business doing? It's plugging along. It's plugging along. It's
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.900]   more of a labor of love. A labor of love. In a business. Yes. Project. Give me a plug for
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.740]   the website so we can tell everybody where to go. Sure. It's fits with fits.com. And
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.460]   do you call yourself fits? Is that the idea? Fits with fits. So the idea is that that's
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.460]   short for outfits with benefits. Oh, outfits. I get it. Yes. Fits with fits. So it fit.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.300]   They fit with your other fits. It's all sustainable. It's all secondhand. And actually, I am giving
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.880]   away a set right now. So if anyone is interested in this and thinks it's a cool thing, there's
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.700]   a local business person here in Orange County where I live who has a real world brick and
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.120]   mortar boutique called Bohemia Newport Beach. And she has struggled through the pandemic
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.000]   that has managed to keep her business open. And she had the dubious honor of being the
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.920]   first business in Orange County to require customers to be vaccinated to enter her store.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.780]   Oh, God. And so. No one's coming in that, right? And she's got to go to a separate.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.160]   I think she's doing great, but she is located in this very touristy part of town right
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.420]   down by the beach, right down by a lot of bars. And so there's a sign out front that
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.960]   says you have to be vaccinated to come in and she's gotten a bit of grief. So I am giving
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:20.720]   away a set of fits with fits to help her out. So if you go to Bohemia Newport Beach on Instagram,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.120]   there's information there how to enter and win it. And I will just say too that you don't
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.140]   have to wear them yourself. They are giftable. They arrive very nicely packaged and might
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.180]   be a nice gift for someone. It's really cool. This is something Denise has done for years.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.260]   She's got a whole look based around going to secondhand stores and so forth. If you follow
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.620]   it or Instagram, you've seen these every day. These great looks. And now you can participate
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.060]   with these timely drops. I love the idea. And I think it's great that you're supporting
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.000]   a store that requires masks for all the grief they get. I don't know about you, but I much
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.080]   prefer to patronize a restaurant or a business where they say vaccinations masks, please.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.560]   I feel much safer. You know, I let if you don't want to mask, if you don't want to get
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.760]   a vaccine, that's fine. Go to those businesses and I'll just stay away. Thank you very much.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.520]   I think this is this is why I don't know what's happening. It's crazy. Anyway, great.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.320]   Sad she got attacked. You know, I mean, so it's ridiculous. So ridiculous. Also with
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.380]   this sitting just to your left, Nicholas De Leon, he is a senior reporter, Consumer Reports
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.020]   specializes in tech there. Hey, Nicholas, how are you? Hello Leo. I'm doing well. How
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.440]   are you? It's great. We haven't had John in a while. It's good to have you back. I just
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.620]   used Consumer Reports to pick out a induction stovetop. And actually we were about to buy
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.380]   the one that was lowest ranked for repair bill. So I went, no, put the brakes on, Lisa.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.860]   We're getting the one that's number one. You actually you reviewed a Bosch cooktop. He
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.440]   said it's the most the first time we've had a perfect like a perfect score in a long time
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.940]   for a cooktop. So that's all I'll take a word for it. I don't know anything about
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.020]   you don't do those. Not really. But as you mentioned, repairability, that is something
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.320]   we're trying to think a little bit more about like that should be a key component of a
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.420]   purchase decision. You don't you don't want to encourage a waste or just whatever type
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.660]   of waste. Repairing stuff is important. And we're thinking about it. Are you guys going
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.660]   to review the Fairphone? That's that's an interesting question because it's not technically
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.180]   available in the United States. I did ask the powers that be that we should at least do
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:39.580]   something about it. I actually just yesterday got the what the laptop the the framework
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.900]   I will framework. Can I say how I feel about I don't want to prejudice you? Sure. I mean
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.540]   I've never had impressions. No spoilers. It's awesome. And and I'm running it not with
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.580]   Windows but with Linux and Linux installs flawlessly. It was as if it was built for
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.620]   Linux. Really love it. It's my favorite current favorite laptop is a framework. So yeah, no,
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.780]   I just got it in the mail. Maybe two days ago we'll be doing something hopefully the
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.580]   next couple weeks on it. Not an official review. I don't think not a test. See I got
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.860]   this whole weird dichotomy but we'll have some concept on it shortly. So yeah, I mean
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.940]   I love Consumer Reports. I've been a member for decades now. And I know that you have
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.140]   a real methodology and the things the way you do it. I really respect it and I trust
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.180]   it. So thank you for doing the work you do. Also with us a man who cannot stop starting
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:37.140]   new websites. Seth Line-Travi, he started nine of was nine of five Mac your first?
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:45.500]   Yep. Yep. And then 2007. Wow. And of course he discovered Mark Gurman nine to five Google.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.700]   Now you also have electric which is for electric vehicles. You were telling me about some of
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   the new sites you've started including a site connect with Watts for connect the Watts
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.460]   the Watts but connect the Watts which is for people who use those home fitness systems
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:09.740]   like the Peloton and Apple Fit. I think that's great. You can't stop. You just can't stop.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.180]   Very impressed. It's great to see you. Thank you. It's your labor of love though. I think
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.500]   I get the sense it's electric. At the moment yeah it just feels like the moment you know
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.180]   for electric vehicles. So sure. And electric bikes, electric cars, everything. Sure is.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:32.780]   So I spent probably a in order amount of time there. We do too actually. If you go in our
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:40.820]   garage there's a bolt. There's a Mustang Mach E. We just bought the SE Mini Cooper which
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.660]   is delayed because of chip shortages but we'll get that later in the year. There's two segues.
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.980]   There's not enough plug sockets. There's four e-bikes. It's crazy. Everything's electric.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.220]   The e-bikes did you get? We ended up you know I and I probably should have read electric
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.820]   before I did it. We ended up getting what I consider to be a good quality e-bike but
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:07.100]   that cost a little bit less. And it's called and I can't remember the name but I really
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:13.660]   liked him. We have a few of them. My son we end up getting a more expensive specialized
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:20.220]   e-bike because I don't know why he we wanted to get him a nicer bike. And then I also I
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:27.780]   have the is it the system system 73 what is the name of that super 73 that was the first
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.820]   I got. We just rode those around Germany. They were a ton of fun. They're so cute. I got
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.940]   him because they look like a little electric motorcycle kind of and a really fun to drive
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:43.220]   around. So I have that but the but the main workhorse is the rad power. Oh yeah those are
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.860]   great. Yeah but very happy with those and they're fairly inexpensive compared to well
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:53.380]   the specialized was like seven grand. Geez I know it's crazy. It's like car. Yeah we
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:59.900]   just reviewed the what is it the woohoo the woohoo the touch one. I can't remember the
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.700]   name of it but I really loved it. So I'm the e-bikes are the most fun thing ever invented.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.700]   I have to agree. Yeah really really like a kid again. Yeah they're really fun to drive.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.540]   All right. I have a brand for you to review real quick before we leave the e-bike. Have
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:24.980]   you ridden a stroma yet? No. Oh the stroma sounds good. That's good. It's got to be good.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:31.620]   It's made with Swiss power. Is that what you ride? Boy that's cute. Is that what you
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.060]   ride Denise? So a friend of mine who likes to make me ride up and down Mount Tam with
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:43.740]   her when I can visit as one of these and I borrowed her husband's. Yeah you've ridden
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.260]   one. Yeah. Yeah you kind of don't want to ride anything else especially if you're going
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:56.220]   to take long very hilly rides. I love the bags. The battery capacity on these is amazing.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.780]   What I wish is that the cities were more bike friendly. I mean the real reason I don't ride
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:06.980]   it all the time. I would ride it all the time but I'm afraid of getting clobbered. There's
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.700]   a you know these this ghost bike movement where they paint where somebody's died riding a
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.380]   bike and they paint the bike's white. They're all over Sonoma County but there's one on the
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.340]   bridge that I would go over every day. As soon as I saw the ghost bike somebody was killed
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:25.340]   there. It's like yeah I guess I'll be driving. Yeah those bike those ghost bikes are meant
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:31.900]   for drivers but I feel like they scare more bikers than than car drivers. Yeah well it's
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.900]   a very I always felt nervous going over it. Even before I was scared of this bridge there's
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.180]   no bike lane. It's very narrow. It's terrifying. You've got to I always would look over my shoulder
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.140]   and wait till there was no traffic and then speed over the bridge but it's just it's not
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.340]   bike friendly. It would probably be nice if cities were more bike friendly. It would be just
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:55.660]   a wonderful way to to get around. I'd love to see that. And maybe then I would get a Stoma.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:01.260]   Like the looks of that that's great but we have we have all the rad powers the city and the
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:08.860]   and the big fat tire one. Very happy with us. All right enough. Enough. Let's talk tech.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:16.780]   Tonight and I guess you know what in about 20 minutes on the east coast 60 minutes is going to
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:24.460]   do a big expose on Facebook. Facebook already nervous after seeing the tease Nick Clegg who runs
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:33.020]   their I don't know effort to calm everybody down division has already put posted on Friday a Facebook
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:43.020]   post saying don't worry. It's not bad. It's not like it's like they say. 1500 word went memo.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.340]   He's Facebook Facebook's vice president former deputy prime minister in Great Britain
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:56.460]   with interesting reviews. He wrote a 1500 word essay. He's their vice president of policy and
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:03.340]   global affairs to preempt the whistleblower interview tonight on 60 minutes. He said the
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:10.380]   allegations are misleading. This is I think Facebook's point of view on this and I'm not
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.100]   sure I disagree with it. Social but this is a quote from Clegg's memo. Social media has had
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.820]   a big impact on society in the recent years. Facebook is often a place where much of this debate
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.700]   plays out. But what evidence there is simply does not support the idea that Facebook or social
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:32.140]   media more generally is the primary cause of polarization. I don't disagree. Facebook's been in
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:38.140]   spotlight ever since the Wall Street Journal began its Facebook files reports last week
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:43.900]   primarily based on this whistleblower who is I guess finally coming forward on 60 minutes
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.260]   later this week here she will be testifying in front of the Senate so we'll probably learn their
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:56.860]   identity at that point. The documents that were leaked out include internal slide decks one of
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:03.260]   which said Instagram is bad for young women who feel bad about themselves already feel worse
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:11.340]   after Instagram after seeing Instagram Facebook said you've mischaracterized the findings but
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:17.340]   the real accusation is that Facebook kind of like big tobacco knows about the problems Facebook
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.460]   causes but buries it doesn't release that information to the public let alone doing anything about it.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:30.700]   Denise is there anything Facebook could do? Should Facebook be worried about tonight 60 minutes?
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:37.740]   Well I think they've gotten out in front of it and I don't know if you've seen he not only issued a
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:46.700]   memo but also was on Brian Stettler's show on CNN so if you've seen Nick Clegg speak about this as well
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:53.260]   he's very commanding and capable and I think persuasive and makes some good points about the
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:15:01.420]   fact that there's not a whole lot Facebook can do to shut down things as they're happening in real
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:12.860]   time for example. There's a fine line between needing to hopefully detect and stop terrorist
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:20.860]   acts and also needing to let people do what Facebook is for, organize, congregate, talk with
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:27.500]   each other and certainly you're not going to hopefully nobody wants to keep Facebook from
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.620]   doing the latter that's what it's there for we can't just have an internet where everybody,
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.180]   I suppose we could that's the alternative right to have an internet where everyone has their own
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:46.780]   websites and no platforms. That's basically what you're headed toward if you're saying that social
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:54.140]   networks can't let people organize a march in Washington you know I mean of course we're
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.180]   concerned about more than just a march but one of the things that whistleblower said is that
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:06.140]   Facebook and this is some internally I think some Facebook employees have also raised this issue
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.820]   that they had protections in place for the election but as soon as the election was over they took
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:18.780]   them down and it's now being said that was premature because it was then that Facebook was used to
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:24.380]   organize the January 6th in direction so that perhaps Facebook acted too quickly to take down
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:29.660]   their protections. You can't say that all the problems in the world come from Facebook by any
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:35.340]   means. Nick Legg says it's ludicrous to blame the Capitol riot on social media. I guess the
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:43.180]   question is does Facebook have any responsibility in I mean they seem to they take down you know
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:49.660]   false COVID and vaccine posts they try to do something about it. Do they have any responsibility A and
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:55.020]   B do they have the capability they're big they're huge it'd be almost impossible to monitor Facebook
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:04.940]   in real time. Look you're a publisher Seth what is the responsibility of a platform in this
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:12.220]   in this complicated world? Well so I will say that I don't think Facebook is a net positive
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:21.500]   currently on humanity. So you know what could they do to get better? Obviously you mentioned they
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:27.500]   had a bunch of stuff up for the elections but then they took it down. Why would they take it down?
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:34.300]   Well the election was over I guess. Yeah but like all the protections that they could put up why not
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.420]   keep those protections up and keep those people employed and keep you know they make quite a bit
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:45.580]   of money. It's not like they can't spend a little bit more money on people looking out for big issues.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:51.660]   I just don't think Facebook is run terribly well. I mean obviously it's run really well as a money
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:57.900]   making machine but in terms of like net positive to society they just do what you know the bare
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.700]   minimum and they they know they're going to get fined by the government every few months or years
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:08.780]   and they take it and they do all the PR spend that they you know always do and we kind of just live
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.660]   with it. Like it just keeps happening and they say oh we're sorry you know we'll do this and that
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.540]   and everybody's like okay and then next month something else happens and this has been going on
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:24.380]   for like I don't know five years whatever. I don't know. I'll channel my friend Jeff Jarvis
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:30.060]   because he's always the defender on our This Week in Google show. It was Facebook was where
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:37.820]   that 17 year old who took the video of George Floyd being murdered went. She probably was too
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:45.180]   young and you know not respectable enough to get the attention of a newspaper to be a whistle
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.620]   over there. So Darnell Frazier went to Facebook and posted that George Floyd video and began
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:19:00.700]   massive movement in the United States to protect black people. That's a net that's a positive
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:06.460]   that's one way social media ampli- look social media ampli- I'm not by the way
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:11.180]   I'm not in disagreement with anybody to yourself because I can. I'm not on Facebook. I don't like
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:17.100]   Facebook but I think it's important to point out that Facebook amplifies all voices and some of
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:24.460]   those voices are good important. Yeah I think there's probably other ways to disseminate that video
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:30.060]   or you know if she was recording it in Facebook if their Facebook didn't exist she would be
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.060]   recording it in a different media. Yeah I think she recorded on her phone and then posted it on
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:39.660]   Facebook. So right I mean there might have been other places but certainly Facebook look this is
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:45.900]   the both the positive and negative Facebook it's very good at galvanizing people to action
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:51.820]   and sometimes it's positive sometimes it's negative. Right I think what we're seeing
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:58.540]   what we're seeing with this this Wall Street Journal coverage the Facebook files and and the
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:05.340]   fact that there's just a big focus on the platform right now is market forces at work. I mean there
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:11.180]   are people both inside and outside the company that are looking at what it's doing and scrutinizing
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.100]   what it's doing and it's got you know Facebook's all about the bottom line and if it wants to
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:22.460]   survive and stay competitive and not keep chasing off people like Leo then it's going to have to
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:32.220]   govern itself in a way that people do feel like it's an @positive or at least not always negative
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:40.300]   which I think we're seeing a lot of now. Actually in all this coverage of teens on Instagram and
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:46.780]   the other leech documents the slide decks that and reports that talked about Facebook's knowledge of
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:53.180]   its impact is particularly Instagram's impact on on teens and how it can have
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:21:01.500]   how it's lots of users link it to their suicidal thoughts and they have negative body image and
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.620]   various other you know very negative things for teens or anyone. I was actually kind of
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.740]   heartened that they're doing that research that internally they're having these discussions because
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.060]   maybe that's a good point. Maybe the market forces or you know if they had not been
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.660]   leaked and outed maybe decisions would have been made that hey it helps our bottom line to make
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:27.340]   sure people stay safe. It feels like it would be fair Nicholas to say to Facebook great you did
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.860]   the research here's what we want release the research let us all see every bit of it to
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:39.340]   let independent researchers like NYU do their work instead of banning them from the platform
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:44.940]   and protecting yourself let let information come out and let us be the judge wouldn't that be a
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:51.340]   fair thing to do Nicholas. That seems fair and to me seems like so such an easy decision for
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.940]   Facebook to make and it would sort of like deflate a lot of this like media angst and antagonism
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:02.300]   towards the company if they were just slightly more open and transparent with this information
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:08.780]   the attitude coming from the company just seems maybe not belligerent but they're
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.420]   entrangented or something they don't want to they don't they seem like they like a fight.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:19.660]   This is how tech this is how big tech acts right Apple is defensive Google's defensive Facebook's
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.380]   defensive yeah I don't understand the communications you know the calm strategies
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:29.020]   some of these companies just to be just automatically like reflexively just like attack
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:34.380]   be defensive rather it doesn't appear to be like you know diffusing the media
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:39.500]   interest so I don't know that it's a great strategy it's one of the big leagues there
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:45.100]   maybe I don't know what he's arguing but this this attitude this combative attitude it doesn't
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.180]   appear to be working and if they are doing this research and they do have you know they
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.700]   I don't know it just feels like they're already doing the work why not just release it you know.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:59.820]   I wonder if Facebook it's two possibilities one is I think Facebook probably rightly so
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:05.740]   thinks normal people are users they don't care this is this is all a big sure they're the Wall Street
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.980]   Journal in 60 minutes maybe 60 minutes scares them a little bit because real people watch 60
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:15.260]   minutes but I think most people say you know I don't care I use Facebook to stay in touch with my
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:20.220]   grandkids with my high school sweetheart with you know with my my neighborhood group
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:25.260]   it's good for that well I don't care I don't see all that stuff it's not a problem for me yeah and
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.540]   they just kind of say they brush it off and I think Facebook's probably strategy is well we're
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.700]   not going to worry about it because our users don't care there's also though maybe Facebook's a little
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:41.100]   worried about government intervention and I'm going to play a clip that's kind of embarrassing
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:47.260]   senator Blumenthal talking to Facebook safety chief this week you know what the term
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:52.300]   Finsta is I hadn't heard of it before but I looked it up sure which Dick Blumenthal probably
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.420]   should have done it's short for fake fake Instagram it's something kids do they can create a fake
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.460]   account so that they can be private so they can share photos not publicly but privately at
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:07.420]   Instagram it's a way to use Instagram for privacy for some I don't know why for some reason Dick
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:13.660]   Blumenthal thought it was something something terrible will you commit to ending Finsta
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:22.300]   this is an act a question for Facebook senator again let me explain we don't actually we don't
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:29.100]   actually do do Finsta what Finsta refers to is young people setting up accounts where they want
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:35.820]   may want to have more privacy you refer to this privacy from their parents what in my interaction
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:41.100]   with teams but I found that they sometimes like to have a an account where they can interact just
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:48.860]   with their with a smaller group of friends well Finsta is one of your actually Finsta is one of your
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:57.580]   products or services no it's not google or apple it's Facebook correct oh my god how do you
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:05.340]   explain to somebody who thinks Facebook has created something called Finsta and so I understand why
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:11.900]   Facebook might be nervous that this guy could be regulating them yeah they are afraid of the
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.980]   regulators and don't you just love how senator Blumenthal there introduced us to the Finstones
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:25.500]   our modern stone age congressional family oh that's good you ought to start a meme I could just see
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:32.060]   a petal in his car congress has shown it kind of singular look they've shown a appropriate interest
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.380]   in what's going on and maybe there's something to do about this but they've also shown a singular
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:43.260]   inability to understand it deck get an instagram account you it's not that hard I think there are
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:50.060]   a lot of people your age who are doing that I'm your age it's bizarre this is his bad this is his
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.100]   bad series of tubes this is ridiculous people are trying to defend him saying no he actually knew
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.300]   what it was he actually did earlier in the hearing read a definition of what a Finsta was he read it
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:06.540]   out loud so he either wasn't paying attention when he was reading it didn't sink in or or people are
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:12.540]   actually like trying to get in his head and say no he must have meant he doesn't want instagram and
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:18.540]   Facebook to enable kids to have accounts that they multiple accounts and somewhere they're not
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:24.140]   using their real name and I mean that's a stretch to say that's what he was going for their failure
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.060]   if the senate saying oh yeah we got to make sure and by the way there is a there are people who
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.460]   think that the problem with the internet is anonymity and we should just make everybody have one
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.300]   Facebook account that's their real name and they should provide ID and one instagram account that's
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.140]   their real name and they should provide ID if that's what they're going for that's terrifying
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:45.980]   that's not the answer right i don't know why do you think i you make a good point Leo that that
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:52.140]   Facebook and all the rest of big tech is is quivering right now they know that Washington is
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.260]   that they're an easy target that that you can do things like grandstand in the hearing that
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:02.540]   happened when was it friday uh and and that they can do that over and over again and get out in
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:08.380]   front of their voters and say look and except when they're completely doing a series of tubes
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.740]   botch um they're saying we're paying attention to these issues that matter to you and and you
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:20.220]   should reelect us i mean basically that's the whole context of what's going on there and honestly
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.460]   yeah if there's if facebook's doing anything wrong if you're just not paying enough money to the right
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:32.860]   people because gun manufacturers and and the military industrial complex and the coke
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:38.620]   brothers everybody else knows how to handle congress it's is it silicon valley just hasn't
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:45.180]   figured out you just give a few senators some money and it all goes away you don't have to worry
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:51.900]   anymore all right i'm sorry i'm getting cynical pardon me in my old age um i just want the
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.540]   congresspeople to start letting their staffs handle the hearings well maybe we'd have better
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.460]   luck my guess that that was a staff he was reading it that that that that was a question he had yeah
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.260]   somebody on the staff blew it somebody his staff really screwed up because yeah yeah are you gonna
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:14.620]   stop fensta what i'm sorry yeah hopefully that first thing got the axe yeah um so what also the
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:19.820]   other problem is even if you if you were to say look this is you know facebook's a huge problem
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:27.100]   as as you do um Seth uh let's what would you do how do you fix it you don't put them out of business
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:35.260]   right uh it's quite complicated i i can't even imagine like how much work would be involved with
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:42.140]   that like on the ground level so but i you know on a high level it's just i doesn't feel like what
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:51.500]   we're doing now is is do you want to have a facebook account i do um my mom thinks facebook is the
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:57.660]   internet so see you see what i'm saying yeah mom is not watching 60 minutes tonight and worrying
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.380]   about facebook she's going i don't know what they're talking about this is how i stay in touch with
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:06.540]   my son right um also you know we have the site so we have to do you know business wise we put
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:10.060]   right business wise we have to put out all of our yeah i say i don't have a facebook account but of
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.340]   course twit does and we have social media marketing experts who post there and stuff but
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:21.340]   because you kind of have to if you're a business i guess it's hard very hard to think of how you
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:27.340]   would solve a problem when you have three billion users all of them are posting you know crazy stuff
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:36.860]   let me connect some dots back to july yeah you mentioned leo that um facebook and youtube and
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:43.660]   others are are taking aggressive steps to keep vaccine misinformation off their
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.500]   site source to find it and take it down youtube just man dr joseph murkola who's
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:55.020]   like the big name in uh in any vax and and you know i mean i'm just kind of spitballing here but
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:30:01.500]   it seems to me like you can trace that back to july when our surgeon general in the united states
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:09.420]   dr vivec murphy if i'm saying this name right um issued a statement advisory did a whole press
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:16.140]   conference i'm not sure exactly what what uh the document he published is called it's not it's
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:26.700]   non binding it's more of a guidance but uh he he was very um concerned about misinformation and he
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:32.300]   pointed a great big old finger at big tech and said the tech companies actually have a much better
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.540]   sense of how much misinformation is being transacted on their platforms and without
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:41.980]   understanding the full extent of it it's hard to formulate the most effective strategies and he's
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:48.220]   got a point and what he's getting without anybody enacting a law or having grand standing hearings
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:54.620]   is i think you can draw a line but from those actions by this one person in government back
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.980]   in july to what we're seeing now on the platforms
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:11.820]   i even if you took away today facebook twitter youtube just like they never existed we still
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:17.900]   have a massive problem in this country right it's not that those platforms are are required
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:24.460]   for the polarization we have in this country right would it be different would it be better
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:31.260]   sath you seem to think it'd be better um i don't think it would be as strong um i don't think
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:38.300]   there'd be as much of motivation to go just you know the democrats and republicans right now seem
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:44.620]   to be just like a hundred percent going at each other and it's going at each other on those
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:50.220]   platforms specific on those platforms yeah although as denise said i do it all fine to her friend who
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.420]   has a store put up a sign saying that uh mass required and is attacked it was vaccinations
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:02.540]   actually so little more controversial than just masks yeah but there it's this is coming by the
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:09.740]   way because pro people who pro vaccination are looking at people who are anti-vaccination as as
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.660]   bringing the whole thing down like we were about to emerge and this was going to be fine people
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.300]   were anti-vaccination look at the pro vaccination say your tools of i don't know who what i don't know
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:25.260]   the big farm i don't know what it is that they think uh and that battle is people are getting more
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:29.500]   and more pissed at each other right it's getting more and more polarized even though by the way i
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.820]   should point out the vast majority of people have been vaccinated now that the anti-vaxxers are a
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:39.660]   minority but they're a loud minority i think if i'm hearing you right leo you're sort of saying
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:44.620]   what what if there were a world without social media yeah i mean is that really a world
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:49.820]   that we're is the problem so bad that that's where we want to go i mean
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:57.260]   so i mean you can make the argument that uh my business is based on you know internet broadcasting
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:02.300]   and so it's a form of that um i don't yeah where do you cut it off i don't know i mean i don't know
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.980]   do you remember i don't know if you've ever had andrew keen on any of the shows on the network
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:11.020]   yeah remember he's got the cult of the amateur cult of the amateur yeah right he predicted this
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:19.500]   he did we're we're living it he said that we would be celebrating the lack of expertise in the world
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.300]   and that's exactly what's happening when you hear uh people like adam korean is podcast called
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:31.660]   physicians the medical elite as if there's some hell because they studied medicine for seven years
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.380]   they're somehow you know taking advantage of us and we should listen to somebody who hasn't
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:42.780]   studied medicine for medical advice no there's there it's not elitism it's expertise
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:49.820]   and it's okay to have experts in fact probably better to listen to experts than not experts
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:55.500]   i don't know i don't so i don't think you get to take away everybody's megaphone though you know
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.700]   i mean you know what even if i wanted to it's it's the that's that's out of that that horse has left
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.300]   the barn a long time ago there's nothing you can do about that that's it's a fantasy
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.860]   i'm just it's an interesting thought experiment would we be different would we be better off without
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:15.580]   these maybe but the fact is we got them what if there was like an open source block chain
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:23.020]   you know it ran off the blockchain like facebook that you had control of you you know you didn't
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:27.500]   you decided what you saw what you know you didn't see you don't even have to go so far as blockchain
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:33.260]   if uh i i really wanted my family to use discord and have a private family discord you could have a
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.780]   a private server that's discord there's no ads in it there's nobody else in it it's just whoever
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.900]   you invite to be on it and it's and your mom would stay in touch with you and she could chat with
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.980]   you and see pictures and all that stuff there's plenty of ways to do that you can have a finsta
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:53.820]   there's plenty of right yeah um it's funny i i to me i feel like i
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.900]   social media is pretty good for me like i i don't see a lot of craziness i mean i on on instagram i
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.780]   look at pictures of like watches i can't afford which is nice to aspirational yeah uh it makes
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.580]   you feel bad about your current watch but that's okay what are you gonna do though uh but yeah soccer
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.380]   stuff and my youtube is all video games and computer benchmarks and it's like i don't know
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:19.740]   what level is this what people choose to expose themselves to if you're if you're someone who's
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:25.980]   i just posed into anti-elite those medical elite and you find those communities maybe facebook could
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.820]   make it harder to find those communities or maybe they suggest those communities to you but if
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:35.340]   you're someone's just like i love the nba i like watching nba highlights on twitter uh i don't
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:40.140]   know that seems fairly harmless to me i don't know no i hear that argument all the time from a lot
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.260]   of people say i love my twitter i love my facebook i love my instagram because i only follow people who
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:50.140]   you know and i think that's really the case for everybody uh who loves those platforms they
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.740]   follow the people that say that you know say things consonant with their own beliefs
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:59.020]   right and you can't fault facebook for providing that platform for people they choose their beliefs
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.740]   they choose they're gonna follow i mean i remember when i was uh you know 15 16 i was on a
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:08.780]   usenet professional wrestling groups discussing the latest story lines and all that stuff it's like
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:14.700]   i found that was that was that social media i don't know do we blame usenet for making me
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:21.340]   interested in you know the rock or whatever i don't know uh but i it is very interesting to me i
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.740]   am very much of the person it's like you know these tools these are tools you know you can use them
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:30.220]   for for good or bad uh you know obviously it does feel that the companies can make it a little
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:37.100]   harder to find some of the bad stuff uh but facebook and twitter they didn't invent uh you know bad
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:42.700]   people they twitter did not invent jerks you know zuckerberg did not invent people who are mean to
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:52.300]   each other you know yeah a couple of thoughts the current hand ringing is about i mean some of
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.940]   the current hand ringing anyway it's about kids the you know very current hand ringing right now
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:06.940]   and and are these platforms doing enough to protect kids from the adverse impacts of seeing
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:11.500]   watches that are very expensive that they can't afford them yet they want to feel bad about
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:19.820]   maybe and seeing people who have you know so perfected their their image i mean it's it's unreal what
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:27.500]   you can do with the proper cameras and filters and and and you know for us as a uh tech show and
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:36.540]   and tech journalist people um there is a huge boom i would say uh to sort of gadgetry that is all
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:42.780]   aimed at how do we look good on these platforms i would go so far as to say the the current
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.900]   iteration of the iphone they just started selling it's new what's it called cinema mode yeah where
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.220]   they've taken yeah where they've taken you blur out the background and photos in portrait mode you
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:59.260]   can you can do that in your videos now too or you can buy those new ray bands designed to put pictures
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:06.540]   up on facebook right from the camera in your glasses yes yes we live in that world so i mean
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:12.700]   if we live in a world where you know okay do kids really need to be protected from some of this stuff
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:18.860]   i'd say yes but a lot of that should fall to how kids are educated about how to use the tools
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:25.900]   what harms the tools can do to them how to you know take it and stride and take it with a grain of
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:32.220]   salt and know that i mean i have a teenager and i can tell you he and all his friends know that
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:38.140]   the stuff that they see on instagram isn't real they know that it's good it's uh formulated for
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:42.540]   their consumption that doesn't mean they don't hold themselves to those standards but they're
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:48.460]   skeptical about it they they're aware of it yeah um i would if anything good came out of this is
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.620]   the fact that adam mccerry announced that instagram was not going to do instagram kids
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:59.500]   uh because of this scrutiny which was i think a good idea to not do that you know i actually
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:06.380]   am kind of sad about that really i mean not somebody's got to give kids a platform they can use
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:11.340]   they're i don't even know if club penguin exists anymore but they they're gonna go somewhere
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:19.500]   shouldn't it be you know shouldn't it be by a company who understands what their regulatory
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.860]   obligations are under cappa and you know that's actually gonna have the
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:30.700]   huge depockets you need to be able to comply with those regulations that are already on the books
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:40.700]   and uh now we've got our ftc chair lina con is her name yeah um she uh she issued a memo this week
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:48.140]   that is really interesting and deserves a deep dive about how what the ftc under on her watch what
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:55.900]   she wants the ftc to do about privacy and ad tech and children's tech and um on and on it's pretty
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:01.100]   interesting and and she's very savvy and very and big tech right she's really concerned about the
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:06.540]   impact of big tech and and she may you know there's been some pushback that some of what she's
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:13.020]   proposing might be beyond the ambit of what the ftc is actually allowed to do under its designated
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:20.780]   authority but but it's interesting that there might be some um attention paid from that front
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.460]   because the ftc is also who's responsible for enforcing cappa one of the things she says is
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:33.340]   if you expect us the ftc to you know be the enforcement arm of all these concerns you're
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:38.540]   gonna have to give us the resources we need she says they're vastly underfunded to be able to
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:45.180]   do the job here and and she's probably right i mean does she have you probably know better than
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.860]   anybody does she have the power uh to do this does she needs con does she need congress to do this
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:56.060]   does she need the president to do it uh or she just a figurehead is she just there to say the right
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:00.860]   words make everybody feel better uh oh no the ftc has teeth and it can enforce things and she
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:06.380]   has legal theories as to how she has the authority to do some of this stuff but those theories will
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:11.500]   be challenged and you remembered net neutrality oh that wound up going back and forth back and forth
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:17.980]   and forth we might see that kind of scenario playing out here as well i think that's all for the good
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:22.700]   i think this is a conversation that we should have the ftc is a very natural place to have those
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:27.340]   conversations the courts are the right place to adjudicate those maybe better than congress
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:33.500]   uh and if if a laws need to be made if any trust laws need to be modified for the modern era that's
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.100]   fine congress can do that this is this seems to be all to the good
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:45.420]   you know it's it's a very it's an intractable problem but i don't think you could put it on uh
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:51.900]   mark zuckerberg's shoulders to fix facebook uh i think he is like any business gonna act in his
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:58.620]   own self-interest as as much as he can i think it's gonna be up to uh us the people in the form
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:04.060]   of our government to figure out how we want to solve this and i think just more transparency
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:10.940]   more openness probably is the right way to go um it's kind of so i hate to get into the conversation
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:16.220]   because it's it's really such an endless conversation we we have it all the time and i don't know what
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:21.740]   the answer is but tonight is going to be an important turning point i think in this because 60 minutes
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:27.020]   has such reach so many people will see this and i'd be very curious to see what your uh what your
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:34.380]   mom thinks seth after the sunday night 60 minutes piece on facebook well i'll ask her on facebook
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:40.460]   best way to stay out i have a question for you do they think it's the same whistleblower
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:48.300]   yes they do but we don't know but yeah that's the that's the impression i get is the whistleblower
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:55.420]   that went to the washington post has now gone to cbs and will be testifying on tuesday in front of
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:00.220]   congress you mean the wester journal i didn't say i met wester journal and then cbs because of 60
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:07.580]   minutes yeah um apparently kara swisher was on uh on meet the press today and uh said that
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:13.900]   facebook is amplifying and weaponizing hate so uh there's a there's a strong voice in the tech community
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:21.180]   um coming in on on this i you said it's a very interesting conversation and it's i think i
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.380]   agree with you said this clearly there's a problem i just don't know what the answer is
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.180]   i just don't know what the answer is um
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:35.260]   we'll take a break come back with more good to have you all uh in fact it's great it's better than
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.900]   good it's great to have you back seth wine trump publisher editorial director at nine to five and
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:45.260]   electric he's the founder there and uh he's got some new magazines great to see you Denise howl
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:54.060]   our mike my internet lawyer from uh Denise howl.info and fits with fits and nicholas de Leon who's uh
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:59.580]   tech reporter senior reporter at senior electronics reporter let me get that right at consumer
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:04.460]   reports great great to have all three of you i have a great little tool that we've been using
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:11.260]   here at twit for some years now to protect your security we talked so much about ransomware uh
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.500]   the real problem these days with ransomware is it doesn't just happen all at once
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:23.580]   uh a bad guy uses exploits probably fishing to get into your internal company network
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.940]   and then instead of triggering it right away they wander the network they look at resources
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:34.380]   they exfiltrate information that they can use either the blackmail you or just to sell on the
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:41.420]   black market uh and then once they really understand your network sometimes months or years later
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:47.260]   then they might trigger the ransomware so the trick to protecting yourself is to know when
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:53.180]   there's an intruder and so many people protect the perimeter the periphery and then forget that
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:58.460]   you also got to check what's going on in the inside that's where the things to canary is so cool
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.900]   we talk a lot about advanced persistent threats this idea that that that bad guys
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.660]   are in your network but rather than the villain lying in in wait inside your network you've got a
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:15.340]   hero waiting for them it's unfortunate companies find out too late they've been compromised i think
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:19.900]   it's on average uh it takes a hundred and ninety one days for a company to realize there's been a
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:24.780]   data breach that's six months and and you can think of some cases where it's been years
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:30.700]   years before they even know somebody is in the network even after they've already spent
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:35.420]   millions in it security canary is something you have to have that goes hand in hand
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:41.900]   with your perimeter security to detect prowlers inside your network what do they do they browse
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:47.020]   active directory for file servers they explore file shares looking for documents they'll see
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:52.940]   network devices they'll try to fall passwords to log in to your routers and your nasa servers
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:57.020]   they'll scan for open services across the network just it gives you the creepy crawlies even to
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:03.180]   think about it things canary's are a little appliance they're like an iot device but they're very clever
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:09.100]   they can pose as anything when you go to the canary configuration you can tell it to be a router or
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:16.140]   a switch or a nasa or reminds actually set up to be a synology nasa a windows box or a linux box
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.780]   you can turn on as many services as you want to a complete christmas tree light them all up
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:26.460]   or be more judicious the beauty of this is thinks canary's don't look vulnerable in your network
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:31.260]   they look valuable they look like something a bad guy wants to get into with mine ass it has
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:37.340]   a synology mac address it has the synology login page identical when they try to log in
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:43.100]   i get a notification somebody is trying to log into your canary there's somebody inside your network
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.580]   you can even use thinks canary's to put fake files around your networks scatam around the
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.140]   they call him canary tokens they can look like a pdf a word document a spreadsheet
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:57.100]   i have spreadsheets on our network to say things like uh... employee payroll information
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:02.540]   you know and as soon as somebody tries to open it boom i know i love it because you don't get
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:08.940]   you know a slurry of false positives do you only get alerts when there's really something to be
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:13.260]   parrot parrot attention to and you can get them in any way you like email you can get a text message
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.740]   there's a console that comes with the canary you can have slack they support web hooks
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:21.900]   they have an api so you can make it work with anything uh sis log if you like to use that
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.780]   um you're gonna love having this on your system and not just one you probably want more than one
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:32.860]   there's some banks big big uh enterprises that might have hundreds of canaries smaller companies
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.580]   might just have one or two they're deployed all over the world all seven continents
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.660]   the guys who've designed this have been in the security game for more than 20 years they've
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:46.300]   trained companies militaries and governments about breaking into networks they know from the
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.540]   other side what hackers are doing and what they're looking at and that's why they designed
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:55.980]   the best honeypot ever the easiest to configure and it's it's a great deal to let me to give you
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.140]   an example let's say you want five canaries go to canary dot tools slash twit
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:05.420]   seventy five hundred dollars a year you get your own hosted console you get upgrades automatically
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:10.460]   support maintenance if you sit on one and break it they'll send you another one it's all part of your
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:14.780]   deal by the way if you use the code twit in the how did you hear about us box you could take 10
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:20.140]   percent off that price forever for as long as you use your canaries and if you're not happy there's
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:24.860]   a great two-month money back guarantee so there's really no cost of trying this out and seeing how
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.860]   it works the best thing is you put this on your network if you don't hear from it you're happy
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:34.860]   it's a it's great it's quiet it just sits there quietly we've only had our canary go off once and
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:40.540]   when it did it was good we knew there was a was a device in our network scanning all the
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:45.420]   nasses on the network actually not just the nasses all in network devices it was a nass itself i
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:49.260]   don't know it was from western digital i don't know why it was doing that but we sure we tracked it
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:55.900]   down we got rid of it right away canary dot tools slash twit offer code twit 10 percent off for the
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:01.820]   life of your device canary dot tools slash twit we thank you so much for their support of this week
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:07.820]   in tech oh let's see going on with
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:15.180]   but more moral panic let's see what else do we have more moral panic have you seen did okay
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.340]   that was actually interesting amazon had an event we didn't stream it because they don't do a public
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:24.220]   stream but a lot of people went to it i don't know if you sent reporters to it Seth i'm
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:31.340]   imagining did showing all these new echo devices uh i thought one was interesting it was an
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.500]   amazon echo 15 inch screen you hang on the wall
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:40.140]   two hundred some fifty bucks very affordable for what you get but of course the one that
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:44.460]   everybody paid attention to was astro the home robot
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:54.700]   i'll play a little video for you here astro the home robot it uh it follows you around
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:01.980]   if there's a stranger in the house if first of all you set it up so that it does face recognition
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:08.780]   so it knows everybody in the house and it has got the cute little eyes it follows you around if
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:13.180]   it sees somebody it doesn't know it goes and looks at them and sends you a picture there's somebody
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:18.700]   in the house i don't know them there it is just backing up to charge it's like a little rumba
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:24.380]   with a screen on it it also has a telescoping camera which is kind of weird the screen though
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:28.540]   you got to get on your knees when grandma's talking to you you got to get down on your knees
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:33.980]   so you wouldn't want and she can follow you around uh this is something a lot of companies have
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:37.100]   tried to get into this home there's that there's the periscope it's going up
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:47.900]   everybody's trying to get into the home robot business a thousand bucks available uh for the
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:56.540]   holiday shopping season what do you think seth you gonna jump in yeah you you know what i think we
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:04.300]   should have our attorney talk about this whether you get an astro i'm not planning on it i have
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.980]   stairs in my house i don't want it doing a head around the stairs one engineer who worked on the
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:14.460]   team and maybe this is uh bitter grapes or something but one of the uh one of the uh one of the uh guys
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:22.700]   said it will throw itself down the stairs as soon as it can as soon as it gets an opportunity to
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.620]   now maybe he wasn't on the team when they fixed that developers who worked on the
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:31.260]   early version say the version of the robot they worked on did not work well quote this is from vice
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:36.060]   astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented with
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:41.900]   the opportunity the person detection is unreliable at best making the in-home security proposition
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:48.140]   laughable the device feels fragile for something with an absurd cost the mast has broken on several
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:53.180]   devices locking itself in the extended or retracted position which means there's no way to ship it
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:58.460]   back to amazon when it happens they're also pushing it as it is an accessibility device but
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:02.540]   with the mast breaking and the possibility that any given moment it'll commit suicide on the flight
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:08.620]   of stairs it's best absurdist nonsense and marketing and at worst potentially dangerous for anyone
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:15.580]   who would rely on it for accessibility purposes maybe just a disgruntled former astro designer
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:21.740]   i don't know um i like how amazon will just kind of throw devices out there as if they stick
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:29.340]   i know they have this day one thing that they do where it's like crazy stuff and you get to vote
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:35.500]   on it i ordered a thermal printer that would take you could say to your echo print my shopping list
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:40.540]   no good g it still hasn't come i don't know if it'll ever come but yeah you know i like these ideas
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:46.060]   there but you remember the echo the echo look was the thing you were gonna put in your i
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:53.740]   sent you my look do you still have it no these discontinued support for the look oh and i have
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.460]   the you know who knows this could be a similar thing where they but you liked it when you had it right
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:04.460]   i liked it when i had it i i didn't use it as intended and and i think that you know that's
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:11.660]   that's probably true of a lot of people's devices um like there's always the problem with stuff like
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:17.660]   this that they may just say yeah never mind when i put my lawyer hat on you know and we go back to
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:23.580]   our discussion we were having a minute ago are we gonna keep people from having always listening
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:29.980]   robots in their homes um i don't know that we can i also don't know that they're a good idea
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:38.140]   and uh there's a really interesting piece on voice recognition and voice surveillance
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:46.060]   and how it just gets you to a place where you get used to this kind of thing are you talking about
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:52.220]   the New York Times opinion piece uh well there was that yes yes it's your voice being taken for
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:57.340]   profit this is by a professor of media systems at the University of Pennsylvania he wrote a book
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:03.420]   called the voice catchers how marketers listen in to exploit your feelings your privacy your wallet
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:11.020]   it's everybody's worst paranoid nightmare um i don't right do you think that's that like the
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:18.300]   amazon echo is listening to everything no it's not sending that data back all the time is it uh
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:24.060]   let's hope not i mean it it could and from a privacy standpoint i want there to be rules in place
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:29.180]   that make it very very clear that the only way in which you know your voices and your images that
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:37.740]   these devices are being used for anything other than your own use uh is is very well explained
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:45.420]   and very opt-in you know as long as we have those kinds of controls in place then there's no danger
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:50.860]   that you know that that well until somebody decides to break the rules right but one of the things
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:55.100]   to really until the until the data's hacked one of the things that actually seems less paranoid to
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:58.540]   me the taro mentions is that when you're you know you always hear this when you're on the phone with
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:03.100]   your bank whatever this call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes they're actually
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:11.660]   recording it for biometric purposes mhm yeah right and just you know you get so used to being
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:16.140]   watched and recorded everywhere you are that at some point you just stop paying attention and
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:22.380]   don't think it's a big deal and it can be a big deal if we don't have good safeguards on it in
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:27.420]   place and if there isn't good data security in place right because all it takes is one
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:33.980]   whistleblower or one leak or one hack and and all of this carefully guarded information that
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:40.940]   regulators have imposed restrictions on is is out there for anybody's use taro says my research
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:46.220]   suggests many customer contact centers this is news to me i'd never heard this now approach
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:52.220]   and manage callers based on what they think the person's voice or syntax reveals about the
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:58.780]   individual's emotions sentiments and personality often in real time if during a call with a customer
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:05.260]   agent this biometric technology tags you as tense you may be offered a discount on your purchase
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:12.620]   you may be in other words they're i mean i guess any customer service rep kind of does this anyway
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:19.100]   intuitively but now they're using software to do this that's news to me i hadn't i hadn't heard
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:27.180]   that that's you seth you want yeah yeah so that that's scary and creepy but you know it also doesn't
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:34.060]   seem to work because every time i do it it's like the worst experience ever and they you know they
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:38.780]   say these things that they think that are helpful and it's just really just annoying and you just
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:43.980]   want the answer to your problem solved and all the niceties and that kind of stuff really just
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:51.740]   makes me more angry and it's not working what a surprise this is this is a common story where
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:56.380]   companies rely on technology they think to do a better job and all it does is make their customers
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:02.060]   angry look at recommendation engines you know how many how often does Amazon recommend to you
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:08.860]   something you just bought well the ads are certainly like if you buy something you're
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:13.900]   gonna get ads for that yeah something i just bought it i don't need an ad for that that's the best
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:20.780]   you can do right uh i don't think it helps to put things in a package that look like a little friend
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:27.660]   or like walley yeah this thing this astro looks like walley by the way we had an advertiser
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:37.660]   for a robot called curry i don't know if you remember the curry say it was it was they actually uh
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:46.300]   we advertised it they took pre-order deposits Bosch was underwriting it they eventually
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:51.980]   put it to sleep and they said yeah we're never going to get this working because
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:58.220]   because stairs i guess but uh unfortunately i'm happy to say that they ended up giving everybody
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:05.180]   refunds for their deposits and nobody was out money but the curry robot looked let me see if i can
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:10.460]   this is from mayfield robotics this was an advertiser on twit looked very much like astro
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:18.940]   same idea and it did even less but it had the it had the little eyes and it would follow you around
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:26.300]   read you stories make sounds like you know this is four years ago yeah about vector i remember
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:32.700]   when you guys all had the R key vector yeah they had eyes too didn't they little little human wise
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:38.620]   when we when we when i went over to mayfield robotics to look at this i said this is really
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:44.780]   cool it's neat the technology is great what does it do nothing uh what's the point of it well
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:50.140]   your kids are going to grow up in a world where there are robots in the home so you might
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:55.900]   you should get them used to it now i guess you could make the same argument for astro
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:04.540]   the on key at least uh was a toy would do stuff right i don't know yeah it would pick up a little
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:14.540]   block okay that's not it was on in the ad apparently there's a recalcitrant uh spouse
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:20.060]   who says why are we getting this robot but she's mollified because the robot the astro has cup holes
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:25.180]   and her husband sends her a beer she says oh well let's get this now i like it
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:34.860]   this by the way the on key head is a killer out echo built in yeah it's a beer delivery device
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:39.740]   the dream live in the dream i remember there was that there was a an r2 d2
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:45.980]   uh little robot guy you could it didn't do much i'm sure it could fall down the stairs just as
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:52.540]   easily as astro but it did have a cup holder like so there is definitely yep president i don't want
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:58.300]   to i honestly don't want to knock amazon for trying this because i agree with you Denise it's kind of
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:02.380]   neat that they throw stuff up against the wall just to see what sticks and they're willing
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.780]   they're they're kind of brave they're willing to do that complete opposite of apple which does
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:12.380]   years of testing and often doesn't release it because you know we we didn't think anybody wanted it
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:17.820]   i like the testing in public instead of in private i think it's a good to me the biggest
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:22.220]   issue here that a thousand dollars to beta test you know that feels a little a little
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:27.020]   expensive i mean my initial reaction was really oh that that's kind of neat i'm not like ideologically
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:31.580]   opposed to having a little robot crawling around the house i mean that's i don't know i think it's
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:36.060]   kind of fun i texted you know it's a story to my dad when it was announced and he was he's pushing
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.860]   70 and he's super into all the smart homes you name it he has it he loves this that's who's gonna buy
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:46.860]   this amazon feels uh and i don't mean this just disrespects like very boomer like like a lot of
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:51.580]   this stuff feels aimed at like guys really very jetson the group on the jetons and all this stuff
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:57.820]   we want to live in the future yeah yeah he was like he i think he said it was super cool and so is he
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.300]   gonna spend a thousand dollars for it probably not but like again is and as long as you know as
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:07.980]   long as the privacy kind of safeguards are there but also to be he's not super concerned about that
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:13.180]   either actually it's all just kind of neat jetson stuff to him uh and uh yeah i don't know so i
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:17.100]   i sort of agree i think it's kind of fun that they're they're launching this launch stuff see what
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:21.100]   sticks you know maybe maybe it launches maybe it dies and no one remembers it you know two years
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:26.780]   now okay great uh but uh yeah to me that thousand dollars this seem and you know what i i get i
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.180]   won't guarantee but i would be very surprised if that thing doesn't sell out even at a thousand
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:36.460]   dollars because there are enough uh let's say nerds speaking as a nerd out there who would also
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.020]   find that neat just to have it kind of it doesn't even have to do anything it's just cool that it's
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:46.380]   there and then it works i bet a lot of people uh that's sufficient i bet your dad is already on the
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:52.540]   invitation list for the ring security drone he could well we really want we mock this when
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:57.340]   amazon announced it is now available it's called the always home cam it's two hundred fifty dollars
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:06.300]   it's a an autonomous indoor camera that flies around the home yeah uh kind of same idea as the
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:16.620]   robot uh that you might not be home but you hear a sound and so you trigger the release the crack
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:25.180]   and you trigger the the drone and uh here i'll show you a video of this one so bad guy breaking in
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:33.340]   right all of a sudden the ring security drone says hey there's somebody in your house and it
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:39.180]   tracks him and he goes what the hell is that and it plays an alarm and he goes i'm out of here man
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:45.420]   you've got security drones i don't know here's the thing i can see that it terrifies me about both
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:52.060]   the drone and the little astro robot they both have these surveillance modes where they're supposed
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:58.700]   to be helping you control it people out of your house yeah the guy running away that that response
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.580]   is going to last about five minutes and then he's just going to knock these things down with a
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:10.940]   sledgehammer and then this is like the sci-fi nightmare they're going to have to more effectively
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:16.860]   do surveillance right so what does that look like so you're right it's just the beginning that's
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:23.180]   actually a good insight because that's really what happens is it's a slippery slope you start with a
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.780]   video doorbell and pretty soon you've got drones patrolling your perimeter i agree with that and to
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:33.580]   me that is the the kind of the real the real issue here is is you know theoretically perhaps the
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:37.980]   the corrosive effect in society like if we're all just arming ourselves with surveillance
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:42.940]   drones and devices where our neighbors are you know it's not it's not exactly love thy neighbor
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:48.460]   anymore everyone's a threat everyone needs to be yeah makes you proud that is that is very uh
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:55.180]   that is interesting i don't know what uh yeah i want to be at the first big social gathering
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:00.860]   where someone has one of these astros and they've forgotten to take it out of surveillance mode
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:07.580]   and it's going around going where are you who are you warning warning yes sounds this 90 decibel
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:14.300]   alarm so here's a video amazon set out of the drone patrolling your house while you're away
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:21.820]   and it all of a sudden it hears a a little disturbance in the kitchen and it's the telescope goes up
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:28.460]   and it sends you a picture of a raccoon and you go hmm and so you press the alarm button
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:34.780]   and there goes the racquetra sure that's gonna happen and you go back to your wine and astro
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:41.020]   continues to patrol and now here's by the way here is bringing you up here by the way man she
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:47.740]   gets that into and she she goes oh well that's that's different what okay thank you i think a
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:52.460]   thousand is not too much i need my spouse to actually physically bring me a beer at this account
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:05:02.220]   i sent the robot with a beer what do you want lady yeah it's amazing that the length spouses
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:10.140]   will go not to bring you a beer actually if truth truth be told uh i don't know i you know amazon is
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:15.420]   it's wacky it's wacky that's all did you see the saturday nightlife i can't play it because i'll
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:21.340]   get taken down but see the saturday at life skit from last night with featuring jeff basos
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:28.540]   uh um richard branson and a special appearance by elan musk all of them in their space vehicles
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:35.660]   it's it's actually a stiracle oh and wilson plays uh plays jeff basos in the cowboy hat
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:42.940]   i wish i could play it i wish i could play it but uh you're just gonna have to leave that for homework
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:51.820]   afterwards uh we had talked a lot about activisions uh troubles in the workplace about the sexism that
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:59.260]   surrounded the world of warcraft uh group and and and its executives and so forth uh they of course
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:10.540]   were sued they have decided to settle uh with uh i think the eoc the equal employment
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:14.060]   opportunity commission accused activation of discriminating against pregnant employees
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:19.660]   paying female employees less than their male counterparts because of their gender and retaliating
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:24.460]   against employees who complain about unfair treatment so activision is going to settle pay
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:33.100]   18 million dollars uh and that money will go to i don't know remediation programs and lawyers
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:40.540]   in uh in equal proportion it is not the end for activation communication workers of
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:46.060]   america labor unionist file to complete with the nlrb securities and exchange commission also
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:54.060]   investigating but uh at least one of the lawsuits has settled now 18 million dollars over workplace
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:02.140]   misconduct yeah color me surprised that the company with the huge rampaging or statue in front of its
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:08.380]   headquarters might have been a hint that it's not the best you know you want to be one of the boys
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:14.300]   culture a little bit of a bro culture yeah i'd not to give them any excuse because it really was
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:21.740]   pretty reprehensible they had a yeah they had a cause-be room to celebrate uh they said they said
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:27.660]   this was their excuse in court well we called it the cause-be room because the carpet looked like a
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:34.220]   bill Cosby sweater yeah i don't think so i don't think that was the real reason they called that
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:41.900]   the Cosby room which ouch is right they settled the day this complaint was filed with the esc oh i
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:46.460]   didn't know that oh so they didn't go to trial or anything it's like yeah whatever here take some
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:51.100]   money yeah 18 million dollars is not that much money for this kind of thing but as you said they're
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:56.940]   still it's not the end of the line but uh yeah should the ee oc have held out for more or
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:05.180]   don't know how does that work in fd2 everything i know about the law i i learned on tv so i have to
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:14.700]   ask you your an actual layer yeah i mean it it it so it it depends what was being sought and i'm
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:21.180]   sure 18 million dollars was you know considered reasonable yeah depending on what was being
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:27.180]   sought but i'm sure it was far less right right and i'm you know the victims of it i don't know how
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:31.740]   much of that they're going to see and all of that but at least it's not a big law firm so
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:36.700]   it's the ee oc so presumably most of that will go doesn't go to the government right most of it
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:43.900]   goes to the victims i would hope it goes to the senator plumeenthaler senator plumeenthal education
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.700]   fun a very important very important outreach program we're doing with all the older senators
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.620]   yes
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:09:00.140]   uh let me see i don't know if i want to start with the tharino's trial but i know you have some
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.820]   thoughts about that as long as we're in court we might as well have you been i've been watching
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:10.060]   goliath do you like goliath billy ray billy bob thortons uh show about being a crazy lawyer the
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:15.260]   reason this came up in my mind is because they're uh the most recent season four of the last episode
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:21.260]   the last season they're uh going after big drug companies and opioid company manufacturer kind of
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:28.860]   loosely based it's called zax loosely based on the sackler family and uh an oxycontin and uh
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:37.500]   at one point they're in court and uh they just set they go 600 million dollars and he goes oh
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:43.420]   okay and they walk off and uh the whole premise of this i think i don't think it's a spoiler to say
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:50.620]   that is that these pharma companies actually make so much money that that they set this all they
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:56.780]   tee this up the courts don't want the trial uh the lawyers just want to settle and so they tee this
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:01.580]   all up in such a way that uh they pay they're off the hook and they go home and everybody's happy
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:08.380]   they continue to make billions does that make sense yes and yeah i think it makes sense as a
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:14.540]   storyline it sadly probably makes sense as real real life too you know as your life i'm not
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:19.580]   watching goliath um i keep hearing great things so you gotta watch it but again as an attorney
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:24.460]   the only reason that might be okay legally is because it's davidy kelly who is an attorney
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:30.620]   and they his co-creators also an attorney well-known attorney and so i guess the legal stuff will be
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:37.100]   sort of i mean i don't know there's there's some stuff i don't think really happens but uh
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:42.300]   be curious what you think yeah no definitely and and another sort of interesting to watch from a
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:50.460]   legal standpoint show is the morning show which which goes it's back hard and deep and nuanced on
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:56.460]   me too are you talking about the new season or the old season i'm still finishing season two i
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:02.220]   haven't seen season three no season two is the new season there was only one yeah oh okay um
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:08.380]   anyway yeah because the first season was all about that as well yeah uh yeah all right i'll have to
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:14.780]   off to watch it yeah oh that's good yeah let's take a little break my attorney's in house you see
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:18.700]   how he's whenever i get then he's gonna have to ask her the important legal questions actually you
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.620]   have some thoughts about the tharino's trial i called it the trial of the century because it is only
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:27.820]   2021 so there's plenty of time to have more trials in the century we'll talk about that
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:34.220]   and a lot more in just a little bit also with us uh from consumer reports my favorite magazine
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:38.540]   long-time member of consumer union their senior electronics reporter Nicholas De Leon great to
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:46.140]   have you Nicholas i'm saying De Leon right right yes you are thank you okay not De Leon it is De Leon
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:53.020]   yeah it's Spanish i am Puerto Rican so thank you and proud of it as you ought to be my real name is
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:12:00.620]   Leo and uh but i gave up see i had the same problem it's Leo lapo and i gave up because it's like
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:05.100]   everybody called me Leo so i just said all right fine i don't have to explain it and that's probably
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:11.420]   why some people say De Leon because and you know it's i'm not gonna do people people could pronounce
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:16.940]   it it is De Leon if they mispronounce it's not the end of the world let's say it right yes indeed
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:21.740]   Seth Winetrop is also here from Electric i want to get your review of the Rivian you got to drive it
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:27.100]   very excited very very excited what's your favorite electric vehicle right now is that it
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:33.900]   uh i mean i'm a week beyond uh reviewing the the Rivian so yes that is my favorite and
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:41.260]   whatever you drove most recently is that it yeah i mean uh one of our my colleagues has just uh
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:48.380]   finished the lucid air and these are ranting and raving about that as well so so in Goliath
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:56.060]   i was interesting to note that the the one of the big partners has a chauffeur and drives around
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:00.940]   in a lucid air first time i'd ever seen it on the road and it's very distinctive isn't it with
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:08.060]   that bright white line across and it says lucid on it i and it's also very very it's a kind of a
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:14.860]   limousine i mean it's a high end yeah high end inside and out crazy speed power range 500 miles
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:21.020]   plus yeah how do they do that oh it's just a lot of batteries a lot of batteries a lot of
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:26.780]   batteries a lot of horsepower too look at that over a thousand horsepower yeah that's what do you
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:32.540]   need that for that's crazy i just think it's pretty EVs are getting a little crazy with the horsepower
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:37.020]   yeah they can they got the torque i also wonder because tesla for a long time was was priced the
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:43.260]   same i mean really expensive but not luxury as luxury is inside and i've often wondered
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:47.340]   what the luxury car driver is going to do they're not going to choose the tesla because it's
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.620]   a little pedestrian inside it's nice but it's a little it's not super luxurious and i imagine
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:58.940]   companies like lucid maybe uh outy will come along and and and take up that super luxury category
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:06.300]   we were just in iaa in germany and um had a chance to drive the eqs the Mercedes eqs uh huh and that
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:11.980]   and that's a that's a pretty like if you're into luxury that's a luxury car and uh they let us take
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:18.940]   it on the autobahn and all kinds of crazy stuff so it was fun this the lucid has a big wide screen
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:24.300]   on the dashboard that's kind of crazy isn't catalike gonna do that too somebody else is doing that
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:29.420]   yeah the lyric has a similar to that yeah yeah all right let's take a little break we will come
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:35.740]   back we'll talk more about electric vehicles the rivian the first uh i think consumer electric truck
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.380]   it's uh yep seft liked it a little bit we'll talk about that in a lot more
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:46.380]   uh our show today brought to you by mint mobile i love my mint mobile oh man you really makes
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:51.660]   you wonder why these other companies are charging so much for mobile phone service
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:58.300]   the big wireless companies i think i don't want to use the word rip-off but it feels like it feels
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:03.260]   like they're taking you for a little bit of a of a ride with the with the cost and of course after
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:08.540]   years of fine print contracts and getting ripped off by big wireless providers if you've learned
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:13.500]   anything you've learned there's always a catch right there's always hidden fees they always get
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:17.740]   you you know they start low and it ends up by the time you get the billy wow that's a lot of money
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:23.900]   when i heard mint mobile is offering premium wireless service for get this $15 a month of course
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:28.700]   i didn't believe it of course i thought now come on yeah that's the starting price what's the final
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:34.300]   price no that's it it's how much they that's how much they charge mint mobile's secret
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:38.460]   sauce is they're the first companies sell wireless service online only they don't have stores
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:45.020]   so there there's no crazy overhead costs to get passed on to you and mystery fees they just
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:50.620]   pass along the sweet savings directly to you it's easy to you mint mobile will send you the sim
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.300]   but they don't even charge for it everybody else well that'll be ten bucks for the sim no

[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:30.140]   slash twit thank you mint mobile for supporting this weekend tech all right tell me all about the
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:37.740]   rivian all right so rivian makes two vehicles or will make two vehicles the r1t and the r1s
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:45.500]   that's the r1t you can think of it as truck and the s's sev um the truck is a pickup obviously with a
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:50.700]   with a pretty big cab it's smaller than a f150 uh it's kind of like between the f150 and a
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:55.420]   maverick size but it's still quite big especially if you've you know used to driving s tv's or whatever
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:01.900]   and um so you know on the screen uh we're taking a look at the the uh frong it's huge
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:06.060]   that's the best thing that electric vehicles there's no engine so you get a big frong
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:12.060]   yeah a truck in the front that's a nice thing for pickups because you know you don't really have
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:20.780]   any lock space in the back i mean this one has like space everywhere um oh look at that that's cool
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:26.620]   push a button is charging port opens it's got fast charges fast yeah very fast charging so it charges
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.660]   at like 240 kilowatts which is like as you know as fast as uh tesla or even portra right now
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:36.140]   um it's a bigger battery pack so it doesn't fill up quite as quick but it's you know it's getting
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:43.180]   there um so anyway we went up they had us go up this uh crazy breckenridge uh mountain trail
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:49.820]   and you know usually the car uh adventures they take you on are like you know like right around
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:55.420]   the track at the headquarter or something right this was like a real you know adventure um
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:03.740]   then they pulled the camp kitchen out of the uh um middle of the the truck and all of a sudden
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:08.380]   you're doing um you know you're cooking food you're washing dishes you're doing all kinds of
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:14.540]   uh stuff like that so that there it is on the screen that come that's in the truck in the truck
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.060]   yeah it's i mean it's a five thousand dollar option you don't need to have it no but i would
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:23.660]   get it that's awfully cool yeah and it's uh it comes out on the side it's a little kitchen it's an
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:30.460]   induction oven so you're kidding oh you don't have to get the Bosch um so they took us up with it
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:37.420]   in our kitchen it's great exactly yeah easy easy easy easy um and you know we went on a crazy
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:43.260]   mountain it was tons of fun um with one pedal driving as you know leo i love that there's
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:50.620]   you drive with one one pedal you're going up a big hill um so how's the low gear because that's
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:56.620]   always an issue so they had it's called rock climb mode and it it goes quite slow but it you know
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:02.860]   it's very torquey and and you can basically go up like a wall of a hill so um this kind of
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:07.020]   personality i love the i know the headlights were a little controversial when they announced
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:14.300]   this a few years ago but exactly it's it's cute yeah and so you know it does everything right and
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:19.180]   then then you take it on the street and you hit sport mode it drops down like seven or eight inches
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:25.020]   from its like highest point and you're you're booking like you're going zero to 16 three seconds
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:31.580]   so you're you're pretty much like tesla area you know high speed um and they've got they've done all
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:35.820]   kinds of stuff with the suspension because you know frankly most pickup drivers are mostly just
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:41.900]   driving around a pickup on a street yeah um they think they have off-road aspirations right so
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:47.420]   but this thing is crazy on the street too and it's also very roomy and it's got tons of
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:53.100]   like little little easter eggs like there's a bluetooth speaker that's also a lantern that
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:21:00.300]   just builds in there's a flashlight in the uh doorway that's you know like always charged um
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:05.660]   it's like the perfect camping vehicle isn't it yeah it's they they really marketed it well toward
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:12.060]   you know the adventure lifestyle yeah and i mean they got me it looks like it has a tent video
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:20.620]   there's a tent option um as well and it can go on the roof or on the bed and uh i mean it has
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:27.100]   everything you snowboard skis like bikes you can put anything on there um it's just it's just so
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:32.620]   cool like there's just so many possibilities of course am i gonna do all that stuff probably not
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:38.700]   like you know so there's also an SUV version of it called the r1s and that's supposed to start
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:44.140]   production in january and i was like oh you know it's got a third row it doesn't have the uh
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:49.740]   cook you know the kitchen in it but it's got a third row so my kids and my dog and everybody
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:53.420]   could be you know in there and we could take it to bermont or so you could have a family or a
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:22:00.940]   kitchen but not both right in your review you were really excited about the battery recovery that it
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:05.980]   does can you tell us what's that you mean the regen but yeah so you're going downhill and you
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:11.500]   get somewhere the battery oh yeah so so we climbed a mountain and we're at the top of the mountain and
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:17.260]   i look at the the range i have and then we go down the mountain and i've got a lot more range like
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:24.140]   you know 30 or 40 miles more range and it's like like you know i mean i know what regen is i don't
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:30.380]   usually go up mountains in my vehicles but um in this particular case like i regen like a whole
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:35.820]   like commute just going down the hill and you know this was not like a street it was like going
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:41.740]   down a you know rocky pass so i thought it was cool that's one of the great things about electric
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:47.100]   vehicles is instead of braking you can actually put more power back into the battery this
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:50.060]   would be the first vehicle i ever bought because it has a great kitchen
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:59.900]   this is awesome it's a really well done one too like it's not just you know i want this kitchen
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:06.140]   moment or something no this would be this would be better than an rv put the 10 on top
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:13.500]   you go anywhere yeah oh man nice now how does this compete with the f150 the new electric f150
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:20.620]   because that's so i also drove in that one yeah the f150 is huge and fast it reminds me of like a
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:25.820]   work truck you know like in fact it's really interesting to see how rivians positioned itself
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:33.260]   against the lightning which is you know we're the one for people recreational purposes and the f150
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:38.780]   you know it's got power for your tools it's it's you know it's that one of the ads shows the house
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:44.220]   the lights going off in the house so you plug the house into the truck and the truck powers the house
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:50.380]   it's a different market isn't it yeah yeah and and it's wide open right now so these these
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:54.460]   companies are here we don't know what's gonna be yeah what's i mean who knew that electric kitchen
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:24:04.380]   would be that's something possible that's true wow how much is the rivian so they started like
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:11.260]   70 000 expensive and that's half yeah they're quite expensive and that's with some stuff and after
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:18.540]   um the federal tax credit um i think you know the the official starting price is 67
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:26.140]   thousand and then 7500 you get off from the taxes so the truck you can get actually for
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:33.500]   around 60 000 the r1t um after tax credit so that's kind of their you know their advertising point
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:38.460]   but the kitchen's only an additional 5 000 so 5 000 that's a pretty good deal yeah
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:48.380]   i could just see what i i'm not a camper uh but man if they just put a bathroom in this thing i'd be
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:55.980]   set there's the great outdoors yeah you don't need a bathroom that's where you're going the nature's
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:25:02.540]   bathroom right uh rivian r1t and you said the r1s is the suv and when when are they going to be out
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:06.620]   can you you could pre-order so they they just started coming off the line i think the
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:12.060]   first few deliveries are happening now wow and then the r1s which is the suv starts
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:18.140]   manufacturing at the very end of this year and deliveries will start in january i am very i
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:23.820]   am actually very excited i think electric vehicles are taking off and i and i will say thank you to
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:29.500]   elan and thank you to tesla because without elan's kind of taking a big gamble with tesla i don't
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:35.340]   know if electric vehicles would be as far down the line as they are today but you no longer even though
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:40.140]   i think people still a tesla is still the best seller you no longer have to buy a tesla if you
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:44.700]   want to make buy a nice electric vehicle and that's rapidly changing there's some great electric
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:53.500]   vehicles out there that's true yeah tesla has turned on their full self-driving uh beta uh
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:26:00.780]   you got a button big button on the screen should you push it so the button was actually not
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:05.580]   the button that everybody was hoping for so i'm i'm a full self-driving on one of them so i have
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:10.700]   two teslas one of my teslas is if you know i paid the extra i think it was like seven thousand it's
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:15.420]   really expensive yeah really expensive and that was a while ago and we're kind of like hey elan
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:21.260]   even promising self-driving since like 2017 you basically just paid for the right to pay more for
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:27.340]   full self-driving basically well i don't know if i have to pay more but i have paid a lot already
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:35.100]   there's a monthly fee for it so that's a separate thing they have a separate separate uh plan where
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:40.300]   oh okay but that that's a little bit annoying because if you pay for the separate plan you can
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:46.780]   pay right now and they will put you in the beta right now so oh hey you know i did this like seven
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:51.500]   years ago like why i heard yeah three years ago i'm proud of myself when i bought my model x i saw
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:57.980]   that i think then it was only five thousand and i said you know i'm gonna not buy that smart move
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:04.540]   yeah i did buy the bio weapon defense mode so i'm not completely intelligent but actually turned
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:09.820]   out with all the fires up here was very nice uh yeah that's that's a funny way to say like a
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:15.500]   big filter yeah yeah a filter yeah bio weapon defense mode elan's if nothing if not a very smart
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:24.380]   savvy marketer the big issue with full self-driving is is it safe and if i mean obviously you as the
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:31.100]   as the purchaser are in the beta but let's not forget all the people around you
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:37.180]   as you drive down the road they're also unwittingly in the beta of the full self-driving aren't they
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:42.940]   yeah and tesla gets around this by saying you're not you're fully responsible you're driving
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:48.780]   you're driving so so it's really not self-driving at all it's your what you know your it's driver
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:55.580]   is right and i wish they'd call it that i think it's i honestly think it's irresponsible to imply
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.660]   that the car is driving itself yeah i think the marketing is a little off there for sure
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:05.980]   do you just turn it on oh i i'm not allowed to now we're we're doing this uh score thing i can
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:13.100]   bring my score up really quickly here but if you have to earn the right right because of your
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:17.820]   safe driving there's the insurance calculator built into the teslas yeah so we have a safety
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:23.100]   score if you can see what's your safety score ninety one ninety one it's not bad what do you have
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:31.500]   to have well so elan's made it so that um he basically will give the highest thousand people
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:38.780]   access every week so like you know the people who have ninety nine they're getting it this week
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.620]   and how do you get it how do you so what are you doing wrong that you're only ninety one how do you
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:47.260]   get a ninety nine all right let's take a look here uh forward collision warning so i have a thing in
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:52.540]   my driveway if it beeps at you uh because you're about to run into something that way right but tesla
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:59.580]   the autopilot thinks that this rock and and uh tree is is a car so every time i pull out of my
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:06.780]   driveway yeah right hard braking which like hey you know like hard braking is it something you should
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:14.380]   do right yeah and then unsafe following i'm at 19 percent i don't know oh dude you are one of those
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:20.140]   guys you like to drive right up on the butt of the car in front of don't do that i hate it when
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:27.580]   people do that i don't think i do that twenty percent of the time buddy elan knows also this is on my
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:33.340]   wife's car so the one the one that my wife tries yeah maybe she's doing well i'm blaming her but
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:38.380]   it's really me yeah and do you want kind of pivot on that weren't they just gonna give it to everybody
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:46.300]   and then demand oh yeah i mean so so this is tesla in a nutshell announce something amazing
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:52.060]   and a time frame that seems unbelievable yeah then every week just start walking that back walk it
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:57.100]   back walk it back and then the features come off yeah you know a little bit at a time a little bit at
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:01.180]   a time oh it's not going to have 500 miles of range oh it's not you know like it all just comes
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:06.540]   back really slowly and then you get a pretty good thing you know a couple years late didn't he say
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:12.780]   that by 2018 that tesla owners would be able to let other people drive their cars as a cab they
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:18.140]   would just and you just put what would go robo taxi would go to the people and they could get in
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:22.380]   that was gonna be like two years ago that was gonna happen yeah i don't know how i don't know why
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.580]   people believe anything he says anymore it's it's really quite frustrating
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:32.620]   and yet i mean i want to keep it well credit space x is amazing again we wouldn't have electric
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:37.580]   vehicles at the level we have without elon what the hell's going on there what's your sense of that
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:45.020]   i don't know uh i think benedict evans said uh something that nobody knows how to deal with like
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:53.020]   this particular situation because you know elon is a liar that delivers somehow delivers
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:58.700]   and uh says the actual quote and i have the tweet here elon musk is a
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:06.220]   who delivers oh this breaks a lot of p- well i'm gonna give you dispensation this once
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:11.100]   to use how did you pull that up so quick by the way i'm i'm good i'm a master wow fool
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:17.820]   this breaks a lot of people's pattern matching in both directions yeah that's right benedict
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:22.860]   that's exactly right that's a astute yeah the one of those likes is me
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:32.700]   one of the 5,418 likes right yeah that's that's that's you know ebbins is actually very insightful
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:37.500]   we quote him a lot on mac break weekly because he's a he's a smart guy yeah he's amazing if you guys
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.100]   aren't if everyone listening isn't subscribed to his newsletter you should be
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:46.940]   hey uh Jason let's try to get him on a twit i don't know if we've tried before but let's try
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:53.580]   to get him on it he'd be fun to have him on you drive a tesla denise i feel like you might do you
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:32:01.020]   no i drive a ford uh from way back when um ford was such a strong sponsor here uh
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:08.380]   aww yeah i bought a mustang back in those days yeah i've i bought an explorer then and then i
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:16.860]   i have thought about that oh well i mean back at that time ford was the only person really doing
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:22.940]   telematics right that's right and and i liked them and i wanted to have that the original sync
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:29.180]   was fantastic and then ford screwed it up yeah they actually ruined it yeah yeah so i still drive
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:35.500]   a ford but i am um i'm on my second to explorer now we we went hundred thousand miles on the first
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:42.860]   one i see traded it in uh so i am i have not yet taken the electric vehicle plunge yet except for
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:50.620]   my bike we ended up putting in plugs on both sides of the garage because we have now three electric
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:55.900]   vehicles fortunately one of them's charging outside because we don't want any fires but uh
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:02.460]   i want to story that is how about how about uh how about you nicholas are you are you uh on the
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:07.420]   eevee trainer uh i have a very old honda civic i'm not so much of a car
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:13.420]   guy you don't go anywhere we let a lot of grantirismo yeah there you go you don't leave the house much
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:18.460]   about it what do you need no what do you need a car yeah yeah that really look neat though i will
[01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:23.900]   i will say that they are they are neat i'm a fan i'm a fan a kitchen you have a kitchen in your truck
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:34.860]   what an incredible incredible uh let us uh talk about ferranos the i called it the trial of the
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:42.060]   century is it playing out that way uh Denise i don't know i mean it it definitely has a lot of ups
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:48.540]   and downs and drama and gotchas so if that's what people are looking for in a trial it's it doesn't
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:57.740]   disappoint there uh i think um people were asking me an irc do i what do i think is going to happen
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:04.220]   um and it's hard to ballpark a criminal trial to be sure because that beyond a reasonable
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:09.500]   doubt standard is so high i mean they really have a long way to go to get there and the defense
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:18.220]   is making a strong case that she was an entrepreneur she was trying to create something of real value
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:25.340]   and it didn't work failure happens in silicon valley not her fault right failure happens but
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:31.420]   fraud doesn't have to accompany your failure and i think that you know there's a lot of evidence of
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:40.300]   not nice things that went on there so i'm i'm hoping that the prosecutors do their job and and
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:46.220]   make sure all of that comes out and we'll see yeah the the the verge says that uh the defense
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:50.140]   is strategy to put this trial off as long as possible of course it was delayed because of covid and
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:56.300]   very and i think she was sick and there was various issues um has paid off because it's now seven
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:35:00.940]   years ago and a lot of the witnesses can quite credibly say i don't know i don't remember that
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:06.620]   was a long time ago unfortunately in discovery unfortunately for the defense there are still a
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:14.460]   lot of emails and documents and some of them are are smoking guns uh one lab director said that uh
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:19.660]   they tried very hard to keep inspectors from going into certain rooms there were emails saying
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:27.340]   make sure that door is closed so they don't go in there um it did look as if executives knew that
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:32.220]   they had problems with some of the machines and were attempting to not be discovered which i
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:40.540]   think would be evidence of fraud i guess um there's also the defense that because they were
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:45.660]   the defense was able to separate the trials uh lisabeth homes is getting tried right now sunny
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:52.300]   balwani her partner will be tried next year that because those have been separated each party is
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:58.060]   capable of saying the other did it and since they're separate trials it doesn't hurt either party
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:05.420]   they could both get acquitted by blaming the other person uh i don't know it's uh it's a fascinating
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:15.500]   story i guess the the real reason it's it's important is if if a company in silicon valley i think does
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:26.860]   do this uh sacrifice to safety uh or even human lives to pursue a goal that's bad and we want to
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:32.780]   stop them and i don't think tharados is the only company that ever did that and uh so we it kind
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:38.300]   of need to we need to keep keep an eye on this kind of thing well we we just talked about how
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:44.940]   uh tesla has has or you know elan musk has embellished quite a bit do you think that there
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:49.660]   knows if they were successful and obviously they they were not even close to being successful
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:55.980]   would have you know would there have been any trials or well that's interesting there may still
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:00.460]   be trials art isn't the national isn't nitza the national highway transportation safety administration
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:05.740]   investigating full self-driving right now there's a lot of trials like we could we could we could
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:12.940]   do a trial like every every day probably yeah so so yes there are a lot of trials but they're not
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:19.100]   i don't think they're criminal trials for you know you honor right any of the head of people right
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:25.580]   uh let's see what else should we talk about there's so many so many stories every week and we only
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:29.740]   get to do a handful of them do you do you want to nominate anything nicholas you reviewed the
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:38.060]   iPhone 13 i decided this year to abstain i heard yeah no no no uh and to be clear i didn't review
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:44.460]   the iphone's consumer reports uh we're we should be getting the data back this week uh i think that's
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:51.820]   uh the case uh we we previewed it we actually got a loner unit from apple just to kind of give our
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:57.900]   early impressions yes yeah and reports usually buys their products well no let me let me let me
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:03.340]   be clear uh we for the for this preview that was published you know uh two weeks or whatever was
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:07.500]   that was based on a loaner provided by apple otherwise you wouldn't be able to do it in a time
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:12.460]   of fashion yeah the official and that none of that information that is basically irrelevant when it
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:18.380]   comes to the actual consumer reports rating my my uh my participation in the rating system
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:23.820]   is uh it doesn't exist i don't i don't have a role there uh so we purchased uh about a million phones
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:28.780]   uh maybe eight i think actually the day it came out it just feels like a million if you
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:34.780]   have to sign that check trust me yeah somebody who does i don't uh but yeah so we purchased i
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:38.700]   think it was eight if i'm not mistaken eight eight units uh those are being tested those tests should
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:42.380]   be wrapped up this week so how does that work who is the who are the testers if you're not the
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:48.060]   tester yeah who's we have an entire department uh yeah and i don't even the department with with
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:54.300]   managers and people so it is on there especially trained for this kind of thing and i presume you
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:39:00.620]   have protocols like we measure antenna power and and we have a specific way of measuring battery so
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:06.940]   it's consistent across all devices yes yeah we have uh in in uh our offices you know we have the whole
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:11.740]   it's like a but also mythbusters where they were like a lab it's like it's literally a lab where they
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:17.740]   run these tests i'd love to see that sometime that's a new york state right uh yes it is yeah
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:24.220]   uh so that that's like the testing and that data is that's that is the c r review the rating you know
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:28.780]   whatever the rating comes out it's a ten out of ten you know whatever it is uh but that comes from
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:34.620]   that department and it's my job sort of take that data and turn it into you know a story that like
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:38.700]   my dad will read you know in just seeing the raw numbers he'll get some content because i'll
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:42.860]   talk to the to the testers i'll talk to their boss to get a sense of like i want it you know
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:46.860]   because looking at you know my sort of preview that we published it was like i write you know apple
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:52.060]   always says it's the best iphone ever and it's like well yeah of course you know it would be weird if
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:57.500]   it were if it like one year was like oh this one's not as good yeah but you know what uh what's
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:03.900]   interesting is the scores and you guys have a methodology that delivers a score from zero to a
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:10.700]   hundred the scores have actually been going down for the iphone is that because the competition is
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:14.540]   getting better or because in your opinion the iphone's not quite as good as it used to be
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:21.420]   the score the the kind of rubric is is tweaked with competition and like as our own methodology is
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:25.820]   like oh okay you know uh consumers are really they really care about cameras so maybe we should
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:30.300]   wait cameras a little bit more so it's conceivable the phone could be better but the score could be
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:38.300]   lower theoretically sure yeah well it is i'm looking iphone 10 was 87 that was the highest score
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:46.620]   iphone has achieved the uh if you go to the 12 is 78 all recommended though i note yeah recommended
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:51.500]   is the big kind of the it was just recommended it's it's you know what what's the daylight between
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:57.900]   a 75 and a 78 you know it's very very similar but if it gets a see a recommendation that's uh it's
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:03.580]   kind of uh so you probably can't tell me how that 13 is going to do i have no idea i literally have
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:10.140]   no come on i passed that my department i couldn't even i know who might know uh but i definitely
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:14.380]   do not know i think i think it's a good phone i think it's you know one of the things i was kind of you
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:19.420]   know if you if you have a recent iphone you have if you have a 12 should you get probably not i don't
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:26.060]   i mean you didn't know i i feel i feel no fomo my wife got the 13 and yeah and by the way
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:31.420]   she's been singing its praises she said this camera is amazing she said the better her life is so
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:37.260]   much better she had yes lots of reliability issues with her 12 i haven't had those with my 12 but she
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:43.820]   had with her she said i haven't had one problem with the 13 she's very happy but i also notice you
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:50.620]   know i have the 12 she's got the 13 and i don't think there's much difference it feels like you know
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:55.180]   in a you know previous years this would have been an s upgrade you know maybe the the 12 s or something
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:59.740]   but it's definitely a very good phone the camera is awesome you know i do like the macro mode the
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:05.260]   the macro is cool and 77 millimeter effective on the telephoto is now getting to the point where
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:09.340]   it's really a good portrait lens you don't have to get set right in somebody's face to take a very
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:15.180]   nice portrait so you know i she's taking some pretty nice pictures i don't consider my phone my
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:21.820]   like i don't think that's got to be my best camera so i don't know where i think i kind of feel like
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:26.220]   i feel like phones are almost like fully baked it's like okay next year's camera that's the problem
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:31.580]   better i'm like all right i guess i mean i'm pretty happy now maybe i don't know what i don't know
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:36.540]   type of situation but if we were to like freeze them in time right now i think i would be pretty
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:40.620]   satisfied and so imagine me saying that imagine if you're apple now you have to come out with uh
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:44.620]   you know the 14 next year and get people interested again it's quite a challenge
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:51.500]   yeah we talk about that on mac break weekly and i think the consensus was you just have to put
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:55.020]   on a new phone every year it's just like a car it's the same thing with cars i think so yeah
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:43:00.300]   you're not going to see a big improvement in automotive uh because it's done it's cooked it's
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:05.020]   baked so but you still have to put on new model year and the people who are going to be interested
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:09.740]   the people who have a three four five-year-old phone yeah i think that makes sense and that's you
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:15.500]   know i i i referenced my brother in that article he had a six s uh what was f 20 time to upgrade so
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:20.060]   he was yeah he was like i need but he actually ended up getting the 12 because he was like well
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:24.860]   the 12 is just so much of the 13 i could just save the hundred dollars and you know he's 25 he
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:28.460]   doesn't make you know a ton of money quite yet so i was like i'll just save the hundred bucks
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:34.700]   smart kid and and he's happy as a happy as a clam with the new 12 so yeah i think most normal
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:39.820]   people don't really see that much difference really we do as reviewers now battery life's a big one
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:44.460]   and that's something apple for a long time was going the wrong direction and they i think this is
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:50.140]   johnny i've they wanted it thinner yeah they wanted a prettier uh and finally they're going in the
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:53.260]   opposite direction where they're actually in the last couple of years battery life's been getting
[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:59.260]   you better and better i never had a problem i think they got you know thin enough whatever that
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:04.540]   that metric is thin enough we hit that some time ago and now we'll get thinner because it's the
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:08.940]   it's the thinnest ever but at the cost of battery they didn't say the thinnest ever did they they
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:13.420]   didn't say that this year no not this time nor do they say the fast they didn't say it's faster
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:18.700]   than the old iphone they said it's faster than the competition which i thought was kind of telling
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:23.260]   but to me it was like you know this is these are great phones obviously and a lot of our
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:27.660]   very mainstream you know what do they do it they're they're face timing there's any text messages
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:33.660]   maybe they're listening to you know podcast or whatever uh this is this you know a phone you know
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:37.740]   a decade maybe that a decade ago but you know a phone a few years ago you would have been fine so
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:43.180]   it's like yeah there's it has to be a new model every year but uh this is pretty good and i think
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:48.220]   you'll be satisfied if you're coming from something you know a couple couple years older yeah i
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:53.740]   really thought it's a question go ahead about the camera because they keep improving the camera
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:58.300]   and as leo said you know there's some people who if they're really in it for the photography they're
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:02.540]   not going to use their phone anyway they're going to use a DSLR or maybe a conventional film camera
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:08.860]   right um but for lots of people i feel like they'd love to have that kind of quality on their phone
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:15.980]   is that possible sure uh they're very close they're really close close yeah and if people are just
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:20.780]   sharing photos to like instagram or like like texting to their friends or whatever it's like
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:25.340]   this is a great photo you know the average person is probably not going to lug around a DSLR to like
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:30.380]   go to the bronque zoo anymore like they'll have their they'll have their iphone and take a bunch of
[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:35.980]   photos but i don't know that the the average person is really going to go out and buy a camera the way
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:40.460]   they did you know maybe 30 years ago sure those are through to use and professionals and like uh
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:45.100]   semi-professionalism prosumers yeah of course they'll always look at the SLR but like for our
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:50.860]   audience necessarily whereas kind of moms and dads and and things like that it's like uh the phone
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:58.780]   is the camera so lisa i'll show you a couple of pictures she took a panorama last night uh uh
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:05.260]   she did uh this is an evening portrait i think she's been very happy with it we were at a concert on
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:09.980]   wednesday uh fairly fairly distant she was able to zoom in you can see it's a little soft because
[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:16.380]   she zoomed in but uh she was able to get a pretty good shot though she's very very happy with and
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:23.260]   so i think yeah i think there's i think what people normal people want in these
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:27.260]   is just something in their pocket they could take a picture they'd be happy with
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:33.260]   yeah and they could share it on instagram or facebook and they go see i'm happy with it yeah
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:38.060]   i i think increasingly young people aren't what you and i would think of as normal people
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:45.100]   that there's well say that again yes yeah they can cameras matter to them because of the social
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:51.500]   media platforms that they use and they and because the standard of quality has gotten you know
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:58.620]   unattainable if not just pretty darn high on those platforms so they want a really good camera
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:05.100]   to to help them out i've been really curious how much apple's influenced by that particular
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:10.140]   market segment like yeah we are making a camera for instagrammers and influencers and ticktockers
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:15.980]   it seems to be that's the case the cinematic mode that they're touting in the video is not for
[01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:21.660]   filmmakers it's and it's not for mom and dad taking pictures of babies for a step it's for ticktockers
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:27.340]   right i think you know there's a huge market now we have a used camera store not far from where
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:32.300]   i live and i have the feeling those people just can't keep their stuff in stock the whole it's
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:39.820]   interesting SLRs the actual 35 millimeters film cameras with the lenses 100 yes it's kids buying
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:46.220]   them i love it yeah i love it i hope that's the case yeah there are hipsters out there they're
[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:52.540]   kids who are buying vinyl albums this is a little different i think this is real this is something
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:57.740]   you can actually use and and do something with yeah it's a quality yeah it's interesting you bring
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:02.460]   it up there's there's a watch site uh i don't know if you guys uh hodinkies a watch site Kevin Rose
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:08.220]   is a good friend he introduced me to watches oh yeah yeah oh my god i i'm so glad i don't have the
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:16.060]   money to buy this stuff edition or i said i don't want to go whatever sorry uh and the photos in
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:20.620]   that shoot where we're film i know some folks at the interest and they confirmed to me they shot
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:26.060]   on film and the video sections were shot on super eight so if anyone in the listening audience
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:32.220]   remember that super see they're hipsters that's totally about being a hipster maybe there's no
[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:39.180]   reason i'm a super great video your iPhone is ten times better than super eight right right the
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:44.540]   other thing there's a market for and i can't imagine how many of these you've discarded over the years
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:52.140]   Leo is is the old um insta-matics uh no the the video cameras that had a cassette tape in them
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:57.900]   they were digital but they recorded two cassettes yes they high-hates they were called yes yeah and
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:03.580]   and uh yeah dv pro and yeah that's what we shot at tech tv that's what we shot with uh here we're
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:09.020]   using these cameras what do these cameras take SD cards right these are old vixi can and vixi is
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:15.660]   yeah so my son who's a tiktokker um i asked him well why don't you just use the iPhone he says no man
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:24.220]   i gotta use the canon 5d mark one and uh he uses the iPhone for like that's his second unit camera
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:29.660]   because he does cooking stuff so that's his that's his second unit that's cool yeah i am so addicted
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:37.500]   to henry's tiktok it's so good oh i will tell him he'll be so happy he's i have foodie friends that i
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:42.780]   have turned on thank you he's kind of taken off six hundred fifty seven thousand followers wow
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:48.060]   his last uh that video i just showed the duck there are a landburger 26 million views
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:53.180]   so he's kind i think he's doing something right i did notice something with tiktok so
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:50:01.820]   he has uh an advertiser uh which is a uh a spice uh thing called dannos a lot of people on tiktok
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:08.140]   or you know advertise say there he is he's holding it tiktok i think as soon as you have product
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:14.220]   placement because he's not a big long ad or anything he just holds it up completely punishes you
[01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:21.500]   so he went from 18 million 18 million to half a million 26 million 3.7 million to three quarters
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:26.940]   of a million they punish you if you have product placement in there and i think that that's something
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:31.340]   so this is this was his first ad and it's good i mean it's delicious i mean maybe it's because he's
[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:39.180]   putting french fries in a i don't know what pita i don't know but he's making he's hand making his
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:44.220]   own shawarma i guess then there's the dannos that's it just a little sprinkle he says it's good
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:52.540]   that's all that's the ad but all of a sudden views went way down they bounced back they're not
[01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:57.260]   compensating him out of the creator creator fund he gets a little money creator fund does not
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:51:01.340]   make you a ton of money he gets a few hundred bucks from that uh they haven't offered him an
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:07.580]   nft yet huh no but but one of the things you can do and tiktok says well we don't mind if you do this
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:13.420]   you can sell ads in your tiktok's and he's very doing it very judiciously this isn't an ad supported
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:17.740]   tiktok uh he get i don't want to say the amount of money but it's you know it's some it's some decent
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:25.420]   money and a percentage of sales um and it's enough to live on let's put it that way but if tiktok suddenly
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:33.820]   hits your views you know by 90 because you've got product placement ooh that's not so good and
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.900]   they're not rewarding you any other way because the ads they show are not in your video they're not
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:43.020]   like youtube they're in between as you know as you slide through tiktok's so i think they're what
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:47.020]   they're really doing they don't they don't really want you to make money on your own and they'll give
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:51.980]   you they have a hundred million dollar creator fund they'll give you a a pittance from the ad
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:58.140]   money that they make that's all theirs so but you know what he's very happy he's enjoying it and he's
[01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:02.620]   it's probably going to be a springboard for him to something else yeah when you get 26 million views
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:07.900]   on a video and figure somebody's i don't know yeah somebody's gonna do something by the way it is
[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:13.020]   just torture for you to show that to us i know i do that on purpose look at this this is his apple
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:20.540]   this is his uh uh apple or peach cop much cobbler yeah it's really oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh is it good for
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:26.060]   you or just he just you know it really makes me mad he's a mile away he could bring a little of

[01:52:54.620 --> 01:53:01.660]   for it if you're on a diet salt underscore hank it's also a terrible name but salt underscore hank
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:08.780]   kids today i swear i swear hey i want to talk about a you know notice it's interesting
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:15.340]   we have a lot of security products we advertise he stays on our network i wonder why that is
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:21.980]   you know ransomware attack after ransomware attack business has held hostage you've seen the
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:26.780]   headlines it's every you know every security now is what we're talking about and i think if you're
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:31.820]   in business you might think it's only a matter of time before they come for you and you're going to
[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:37.180]   have to make that the most difficult business decision ever the sofis choice of business do you pay
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:44.300]   millions of dollars to ransomware jerks or do you lose everything that's a terrible choice to have
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:49.980]   to make there is a third option but you have to act now defeat your adversaries before the fight
[01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:55.740]   even starts we have this this company has done something i think is brilliant it's crowd it's the
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:54:01.500]   wisdom of the crowd crowd source security with crowd strike with crowd strike you're not alone in
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:06.940]   the battle against ransomware because really if you want to be secure a secure future demands
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:13.500]   a shared defense so crowd strike they call it their falcon platform it uses their threat graph power
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:20.940]   by using advanced ai to analyze behavior not just on your devices and servers and cloud workloads
[01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:27.100]   but on everybody else who uses crowd strike they have a trillion with a t data points a day
[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:35.420]   seven trillion data points a week this is the early warning system for malware because so many
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:40.860]   people use crowd strike and you're all we're all in it together they know ahead of time long
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:45.020]   before the bad guys get to you they know what's going on and they can defend you
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:50.300]   there is security platform delivers the industry's most powerful set of tools
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:55.420]   to fight today's most sophisticated cyber attacks and you know it's nice even though they've got a
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:55:00.700]   trillion data points it's a lightweight intelligent agent delivered to you through the cloud it's
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:07.660]   easy on you easy on your network but it works falcon complete according to forester delivers a
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:14.380]   403 return on investment that's pretty good plus 100 confidence i had a great conversation with
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:19.740]   their cto who's done an amazing job putting this together michael suntonis's his name he explained
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:25.100]   this how this threat graph system is a collaborative platform it's the crowd in uh in crowd strike
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:30.780]   and that's the concept you know the the regional vision was to build the fundamentals it was to
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:36.860]   bring in all of those signals that telemetry and the more data we get the more information that
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:43.020]   we have we can use that to protect all our customers in real time seven trillion data points a week
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:48.300]   it's incredible crowd strike harnesses the power of every click every action every ally to grow
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:54.940]   stronger and stop cyber threats before they can stop you it's practically a living breathing mechanism
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:59.660]   because this is all changing so fast you need to change at the same speed falcon complete stops
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:05.340]   breaches every hour of every day through the expert management through threat hunting through
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:11.260]   monitoring remediation and they put their money where their mouth is crowd strikes breach prevention
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:16.460]   warranty guarantees up to one million dollars in the event of a breach if you're a falcon complete
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:19.900]   managed customer terms and conditions apply one million dollars in the event of a breach
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:25.660]   cartner magic quadrant named crowd strike a leader for endpoint protection platform for 2021
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:31.340]   it really works join the fight experience the power of falcon platform you could try it free
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:37.980]   right now crowd strike dot com slash twit crowd strike dot com slash twit crowd strike because
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:43.900]   what we've built together is worth defending together use the power of the crowd crowd strike
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:49.260]   dot com slash twit we thank them so much for doing the work they're doing which is really
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:54.700]   important for supporting this week in tech and we thank you for doing the same by going to that
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:57:00.220]   special address that way they know you heard it here crowd strike dot com slash twit we're talking
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:06.460]   about facebook's responsibility uh youtube's taken some steps to be responsible they have banned
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:15.580]   prominent anti-vaccine activists they are now blocking all anti-vaccine content you know if in
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:20.140]   my world that doesn't seem like a very controversial decision but obviously in the real world it is
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:28.380]   joseph murkola and robert f Kennedy jr uh both both banned blocked on youtube
[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:35.100]   good thing anybody want to say anything for free speech or anything like that
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:44.060]   you don't know i definitely i'll say something about free speech that youtube doing this does not
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:50.140]   implicate the first amendment i like to underscore that whenever yes yes that it is a private company
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:54.220]   not the government acting however i do feel like it is acting in response to
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:58:01.020]   something the government has said specifically our surge in general so um i think there's a
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:08.140]   connection there but it's it's not censoring speech for first amendment purposes because it's a private
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:14.700]   actor here yeah um and when you look at you know what youtube has said about what they're doing
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:20.540]   they're going to allow people to continue to have scientific conversations about
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:25.500]   vaccines they're going to allow people to continue to post their own personal anecdotes oh my kid
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:30.860]   had a terrible reaction so that's interesting so they're not going to stop that they're not
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:37.180]   no but if if something is you know the devil's in the details right like would you want to be on
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:41.980]   the team who had to decide whether this was a scientific conversation going on or this was
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:48.060]   actively misinformation i think that's that's probably a hard line to draw but um they're trying to
[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:55.260]   draw that line yeah uh twitch is doing something similar they apparently harassment has become a
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:59:01.500]   problem on the uh let's play platform i you know i play my game valheim from time to time in front of
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:08.060]   a an audience on twitch.tv it's it's fun but there are groups of people particularly two
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:19.660]   people in who have been going around kind of um uh attacking platforms uh targeted harassment
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:25.020]   after an upswell and targeted harassment on the streaming platform twitch this is from polygon
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:29.980]   an organized boycott on the website of the part of users in a lawsuit to pursue two alleged
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:34.780]   harassers twitch has announced new steps is taking to protect users against targeted harassment
[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:40.860]   including a new feature phone verified chat i'm not sure i like this but it's an interesting
[01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:46.940]   attempt you know i like seeing everybody trying different ways to stop this you you can set as a
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:52.220]   streamer you can say that some or all of your users have to verify their phone number before chatting
[01:59:52.220 --> 01:59:59.820]   it's kind of a midway towards no anonymity um that rolled out this week
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:07.660]   right if we're gonna talk about that can we talk about the china video game yeah yeah which also
[02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:15.580]   uses phone verification yeah you cannot get online in china uh anonymously they know your age and
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:20.780]   china has decided to use this to prevent kids under 18 from playing more than three hours of video
[02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:26.140]   games a week this despite the fact that one of the most vibrant areas of the chinese economy is
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:36.940]   video games free to play video games on mobile i have seen some say that chinese kids are not
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:41.740]   stupid and they are finding ways to get around this band including using their parents account
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:49.660]   yeah of course they are i mean i i have to thank china for this for their unsolicited donation
[02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:55.660]   to the congressional tech education fund right because this is the kind of thing that our congress
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:01:01.660]   people like to talk about think about and consider and china's doing a beta for them to watch and see
[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:07.260]   exactly what happened last week i got some real stink eye from our panel on twit when i said china's
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:13.020]   doing the right china seems to be doing all the things we ought to be doing to control it's out of
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:18.780]   control big tech sector and they all looked at me funny it's a lot easier when you're a totalitarian
[02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:28.300]   nation and i have to say if we try can you imagine the uproar if we said many parents tried no more
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:36.860]   than three hours of video games a week it might just go down a little bit hard not only did my
[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:43.260]   mother try when i was young she succeeded oh boy did she i was not allowed to play video games at
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:48.460]   all through the week wow even though i was super into them no and i respected that rule
[02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:53.580]   we were allowed to play friday's after we finished our homework saturday's we could play all day saturday
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:02:00.060]   was was you know free free free one uh and sunday until six p.m until i left for college
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:06.300]   whenever i got to college and i was able to play games you know whenever i wanted i definitely
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:12.140]   felt deeply guilty and i'm not exaggerating whatsoever uh so you know there's a difference
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:16.620]   between you think there's a difference between a totalitarian government telling you to do that
[02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:23.180]   and your parents you know sure but like uh you know semi-joking it's like i lived it was fine it was
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:28.700]   not a big deal um but yeah i get when people are saying governments are doing it but yeah she did
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:32.780]   it and she succeeded and to this day i'm like are you grateful i don't like playing during the week
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:37.660]   it feels it feels weird that's awesome i am i am eternally grateful she trained you well
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:44.220]   yes she did meanwhile i played valheim almost all day yesterday and i've got i'm sore my back hurts
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:53.660]   it's not a good habit it's a lot of fun uh teenagers shinwan news agency in china teenagers are the
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:58.540]   future of our motherland protecting the physical and mental health of minors is related to the
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:03.420]   people's vital interests and relates to the cultivation of the younger generation in the era of national
[02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:11.260]   rejuvenation can't disagree can't disagree but the one of the reasons they can do this is because
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:16.140]   you're not allowed to use the internet without registering they know exactly who you are at all
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:24.940]   times on the internet that has other impacts it may be a little less uh okay chinese game my favorite
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:30.860]   part of that article was the apparently various members of the chinese public complained because
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:38.300]   it appeared that um there was someone who had to be a kid they were oh he was too good
[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:47.660]   he was 60 years old and the video came company came back and said he has passed 30 different
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:53.100]   facial expressions yeah we checked he's a kid he's a he's an adult they said there's no way i think
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:58.780]   he was like in his 60s right there's no way this this guy in his 60s could be playing this well it
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:05.340]   must be a teenager using his parents account no we're either either there's a major flaw in
[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:12.940]   their verification system or this this is a this is a uh an older person playing 62 percent of
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:19.340]   chinese minors play games online 13 often 13.2 percent of underage mobile users mobile game
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:23.740]   users play mobile games for more than two hours a day on working days according to state media
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:33.260]   this is a big business chinese game market estimated 45.6 billion dollars of revenue in 2021 and that's
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:40.060]   ahead of the united states right and back to my point about educating our lawmakers one of the
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:47.660]   things that china did was ban consoles so what happened to the chinese gaming industry it all went
[02:04:47.660 --> 02:04:56.620]   into the phone yeah so compare that to the biggest video game company in the united states who you
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:05:05.820]   think that is apple apple they make from video games eight and a half billion dollars that's almost
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:12.540]   a third of what the chinese chinese economy makes they make more money than sony microsoft
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:19.340]   uh put together and they of course they don't make any games they just sell them on the app store and
[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:25.180]   that gives you some idea of how important the app store is to to apples revenue to the apples
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:31.020]   bottom line uh apple might actually be hit a little bit by this new these new rules in china
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:38.860]   globally customers spend a total of 45 billion dollars on mobile games through the app store in
[02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:46.380]   2020 now remember apple only gets a third of that but 45 billion dollars a third of that was spent
[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:53.420]   in china only 26 percent in the u.s. apples cut an estimated 13 and a half billion dollars that's
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:06:00.300]   five percent of their overall sales for the year big big portion of their revenue nice to be the
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:05.900]   gatekeeper yeah yeah that's what ben toms has been talking an awful lot about is the the best
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:13.980]   position to be in these days is uh is the gatekeeper the the the net the choke point between people
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:19.020]   and the content they want to consume it all has to go through apple from an anti-trust standpoint
[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:23.580]   it's not great for apple it puts them in the crosshairs yeah according to the wall street
[02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:32.300]   journal apple made more money more profit from games than microsoft's xbox nintendo blizzard and
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:41.420]   sony's playstation combined in 2019 combined that's really amazing who's the big game game company in
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:51.020]   america eh turns out to be uh it's apple it's apple uh speaking of games amazon finally has a game
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:56.380]   a smash hit on its hands new world finally came out i've been playing beta for some time
[02:06:57.260 --> 02:07:05.420]   hundreds of thousands of players it's an online game so big success for amazon there were problems
[02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:10.860]   earlier on in the beta but i think they've they've solved all these on launch day which was this week
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:17.820]   seven hundred thousand concurrent players seven hundred thousand which is a new record one of
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:22.780]   steams biggest launches ever thursday morning four hundred fifty thousand concurrent players
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:28.860]   and uh there are on top of that reports of cues of up to ten thousand people waiting to get into
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:36.460]   the game just to play because you have to be on a server uh to play amazon may have a hit on the
[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:44.620]   order of fortnight a world of warcraft forty dollars to play it don't know how much money amazon
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:50.140]   put into it but they've been developing it for years so i suspect it's uh you know what's more
[02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:52.940]   than a movie hundreds of millions of dollars that's for sure
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:08:01.740]   facebook is spinning you like it uh it is leo it's no it's no valheim but it's fun
[02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:08.060]   it's uh it's a for serious gamers it's it's probably similar you know it's a it's a open world you
[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:13.260]   wander around i don't like all the fiddly bits where you have to skill trees and you got to sign
[02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:18.700]   points you can say it's it's too fiddly for me i just want to whap whap things and grow
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:23.580]   onions that's it that's all i want to do build a house what did you do them what game didn't
[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:28.300]   weren't you allowed to play nicholas when you were when your mom was stopping you uh well that
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:33.260]   would have been like super nintendo so i think i was not allowed to play any any of the
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:40.780]   cetera you feel culturally deprived and all of your peers are mario obsessed i mean i was obsessed
[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:44.780]   too i mean don't get me wrong i definitely you know i had all the magazines i've been named all the
[02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:53.340]   pokemon uh i my brother is better at pokemon okay so i think there is a argument to be made
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:58.140]   what did you do duneese with your son there's an argument to made that this is the culture of
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:05.340]   of that generation so i played the lawyer card a lot and said look here are the terms of service
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:10.460]   it says at your age you're not allowed to play look here is the rating it says it's not me
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:15.420]   this is what are did that work people smarter than me no i'll know
[02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:25.100]   i was gonna say that doesn't sound like it was you know a not too effective finger in the diet but
[02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:29.580]   it gave it to help seth do you have to have a little bit of the flow yeah i've got two kids
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:34.620]   and they love playing games and you don't you don't you don't stop them you don't slow them oh i have
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:38.540]   to because otherwise they would just be their whole life you never see them yeah yeah never see
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:43.580]   them and they would just be in it all the time so how do you stop it how do you what is what are the
[02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:48.700]   rules well like one of the best ways to stop a kid from playing a game is saying hey i want to
[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:54.780]   play that game with you oh that'll stop him right away that's right um that's why there are no kids
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:10:02.060]   on facebook right it's the same thing like right that's like listen to my music too same same idea
[02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:12.540]   we do what uh an experience did and and kind of said sometimes after your homework it's hot though
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:18.620]   don't you feel like an ogre doing it well if we're consistent and we're not always consistent but
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:23.900]   when we're consistent um they just accept it then they accept it and they you know then you know
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:29.500]   they're motivated to their homework which theoretically i mean this is all theoretical it like it doesn't
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:34.140]   always work and we catch them playing games after everybody's supposed to be asleep and all kinds of
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:44.060]   stuff so um we just try we're trying you know the parent parent in the uh 2020 is this is interesting
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:49.100]   i know i think i it's super interesting and i think it's valuable as a parent you can use it as a
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:53.820]   tool like you were saying seft to to motivate other good behavior like getting your stuff done
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:59.820]   but you have to watch it because i there's an episode of triangulation where i interviewed the
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:04.940]   woman who was fortnite's ui designer and we talked at length about how they designed the game to
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:10.300]   make it sticky and make you want to keep playing the game the little thing you know kind of like the
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:16.700]   sound effects that henry uses in his tiktok right things that just kind of suck you in and go oh
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:21.900]   that was a nice experience oh you know but it's a conscious oh that fell good manipulation yeah to
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:29.100]   make those games a dick essentially addictive right or you know at least make you want to keep playing
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:35.980]   i mean we're not talking oxycontin addictive but no nevertheless i think they become very adept at
[02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:43.340]   making them sticky that's a nice word right so the other but the other benefit as a um parent is
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:49.580]   giving your kids the tools because their desire to play games doesn't go away as soon as they move
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:55.580]   out of your house right so they've got to know how to balance their responsibilities and the things
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:12:01.340]   they love to do when they aren't pursuing their responsibilities so you know they have to know how
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:06.700]   to say okay i'm only going to play this much because i have other things to do i think that's an
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:14.300]   important life skill to get across yeah little break we're going to finish this up kind of some
[02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:19.500]   more entertainment do i like the entertainment is this light it's not nobody's nobody's hurt nobody's
[02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:24.700]   censored it's kind of fun so we've got a couple more entertainment stories and we'll uh we'll
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:28.060]   wrap things up with an excellent panel really fun to get together with Denise Howell

[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:38.060]   uh so we'll have we'll have uh something this week uh i mean i i've obviously been using it throughout
[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:43.180]   the beta period whenever you call it uh i mean it's fine uh i can pretty audience i don't think
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:48.220]   they should run out like it's the windows 95 days and buy a new pc for windows 11 that's what
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:54.140]   microsoft would like but Paul Theron's been saying it's not ready he says uh it's too buggy still
[02:14:54.140 --> 02:15:00.300]   i i personally will not be updating this pc that i'm on right now to windows 11 for i don't
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:04.300]   maybe not ever but it's gonna be a while before i upgrade this because there's no reason to why
[02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:10.060]   why it looks different okay great but uh is it is it demonstrably better i don't i don't maybe
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:14.220]   some of the security stuff is interesting but like my day-to-day use of using like firefox and
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:20.220]   chrome and like obs i've anything probably i expect obs to break for you know yeah so it's like yeah
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:24.620]   i'll i'll stick with windows 10 personally for a little while but we'll have windows 11 story
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:29.260]   uh hopefully by the end of this week who's your pick in the but in the barca game
[02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:34.780]   uh well i'm a barcilona fan i was in barcel actually lose in barcelona for a few months after college
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:40.780]   but barcelona is terrible this year it is actually quite funny how bad they are so i expect them to
[02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:45.660]   lose uh quite badly well i'm also a Mets fan so i'm just kind of used to like yeah that's like

[02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:41.020]   and i've checked it several times again to reconfirm this is not the pro max this is the pro
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:48.700]   and it feels humongous to me this week in google astros ambient intelligence is that it can
[02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:53.900]   roam around amazon pitch is something that can wander around your house and check things out for you

[02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:14.380]   i showed it i brought to you by express vpn the only vpn i use the only vpn i trust these guys
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:20.700]   will protect you online you know going online without express vpn is like i don't know using
[02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:25.420]   your smartphone without a protective case most of the time you're going to be fine but all it takes
[02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:32.060]   is one drop on the concrete but bluey you'll wish you would have protected yourself you need a vpn
[02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:38.780]   every time you connect to an unencrypted network like a cafe or a hotel or an airport because bad
[02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:44.220]   guys could see on that network and do all sorts of nasty things to you it doesn't take much technical
[02:19:44.220 --> 02:19:48.860]   knowledge these days in fact you could just buy some cheap hardware like the pop Wi-Fi pineapple
[02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:55.340]   and boom you're in a smart 12 year old can do it your data is valuable hackers know they can
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:58.940]   make as much as a thousand dollars per person selling your personal info on the web you've got
[02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:04.300]   a protected express vpn creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:09.580]   so that hackers not only can't steal your data they can't see you you're completely locked up
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:15.340]   it's it's uses strong encryption so there's no way in real time anybody can even see what you're
[02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:20.940]   doing and it's so easy there's express vpn apps for everything you use including your smart TVs
[02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:25.260]   highly recommend that or just put it on your router protect your whole house
[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:30.860]   and express vpn and this is why it's so important to get a good vpn they invest in the infrastructure
[02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:35.900]   they're so fast you can watch hd video i've turned it on on my router and no one even knows
[02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:41.820]   i don't hear complaints because unlike that other vpn you might have used express vpn is fast fast
[02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:48.620]   fast stay secure watch the shows you want the countries you want make sure your internet
[02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:52.860]   service providers not snooping on what you're doing and keep hackers away there's so many good
[02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:58.780]   reasons to use a vpn express vpn is when i trust the one i recommend you can secure online data
[02:20:58.780 --> 02:21:04.540]   today by visiting express vpn.com/twit in fact you get an extra three months when you sign up for a
[02:21:04.540 --> 02:21:15.900]   year that's the best deal express vpn.com/twit i'm a fan i'm a fan you got to use them express vpn.com
[02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:24.620]   slash twit the 2021 list of the all-time most popular netflix shows
[02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:33.740]   this i mean i honestly at the last emmys this last week netflix just wrapped the place up
[02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:40.860]   i can't even they as they said a new record it hasn't been for years in any one network provider
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:48.780]   has dominated what do they win like 40 Emmy awards the most this is maybe a little depressing when
[02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:53.660]   you put that in the perspective because you know maybe it was a martin scorsese's amazing
[02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:59.580]   the irish men maybe it was stranger things no the number one most popular netflix show of all time
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:11.980]   bridgerton 82 million people 82 million people watch bridgerton for at least two minutes that's
[02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:19.180]   all i watch bridgerton for but i counted in that eight's two million i guess um i'm actually pleased
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:27.660]   to see this lupin which is excellent and is in french with subtitles number two 76 million
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:34.460]   highly recommend that show if you've not seen it the witcher tied in third place 76 million
[02:22:34.460 --> 02:22:40.620]   sex life stranger things down in fifth place money heist tiger king season one i'm actually
[02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:45.740]   kind of glad that wasn't you know number one uh the queen scambit which i thought was great
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:53.020]   62 million people watch that number eight on the list that is those are amazing numbers when you
[02:22:53.020 --> 02:23:01.260]   compare that uh to you know network television viewing 82 million people watch that show
[02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:09.260]   netflix films number one i never saw it extraction almost 100 million people watched extraction
[02:23:09.260 --> 02:23:14.700]   then bird box spencer confidential i haven't seen any of these
[02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:24.460]   so there's there's 625 million hours of bridgerton streamed i think when they look back
[02:23:24.460 --> 02:23:29.900]   Denise you're probably a fan i'm sorry i hope it haven't hurt your feelings you know i wouldn't
[02:23:29.900 --> 02:23:37.100]   say i'm a fan but you do watch it don't you i brit well i did watch it it's romance not going
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:41.980]   back and revisiting it it's sort of like you know eating a bowl of popcorn you don't have to have
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:46.220]   another bowl of popcorn right away just didn't grab me and i don't think it's aimed at people
[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:52.460]   like me no probably not it's romance right it's it's like um like we need romance novel
[02:23:52.460 --> 02:24:01.580]   yeah drama right yes yeah sexy though i'm true yes you know what's what's cleverer than
[02:24:01.580 --> 02:24:09.500]   bridgerton but no less heavy on sex uh but but that's the two things i'm looking for clever sex
[02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:15.820]   yeah clever sex well yeah sex education oh i love that show yes that's what i an i start
[02:24:15.820 --> 02:24:20.140]   watching it because it's killing me with killing innocent that's why i watched it because i i
[02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:25.420]   will watch anything she is in and she's unfortunately she's only a small part of it's really about
[02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:30.540]   high school teenagers but she's so every time she's on the screen it's like this is great stuff
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:36.060]   yes she's very talented yes nefflex has got a new hit on its hands that i have not heard of but uh it's
[02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:45.020]   it's a called squid game a dystopian drama from south korea two weeks into its premiere
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:50.940]   it's a massive social media phenomenon number one on the popularity charts in 90 countries
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:57.740]   including the united states it may according to some dethron bridgerton in the witcher as the most
[02:24:57.740 --> 02:25:03.820]   popular show ever so just putting that on your radar have you watched and then we watched foundation
[02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:13.020]   yet on apple tv watching is it going to save apple tv maybe it's good does apple tv need saving i
[02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:20.380]   feel like it has a lot of good shows apple tv and uh apple said okay remember there's a
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:27.980]   industry wide strike in the offing from ayatzi the stage in theatrical employees union and apple
[02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:34.780]   gave the ayatzi the stats of subscribers saying we don't have to pay our employees that much
[02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:42.220]   because we only have 20 million subscribers which is pretty low you're agreeing Seth
[02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:50.860]   so i don't like most of what is on apple tv um i i like the morning show is okay i like
[02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:58.300]   tedd lasso the best you can say about any of it is okay right but yeah yeah i mean i'm not yeah so
[02:25:58.300 --> 02:26:04.460]   it's mildly a minorly entertaining but i mean apple's got unlimited cash so like when he said
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:11.740]   apple tv's in trouble it's it doesn't matter like a million years and not produce any hits and they
[02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:20.140]   would still like just have unreal money so no they're not in trouble but uh they'll never be in
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:25.340]   trouble not age yeah i think that that might be good yeah i i've started watching it it's you know
[02:26:25.340 --> 02:26:33.100]   what it's it's really hard to film these massive sci-fi stories i i always prefer to read the book
[02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:39.260]   to watching it because my mind is much better at generating the imagery than any tv show can be
[02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:43.740]   but i think that given the difficulty of putting foundation on the screen i think they did actually
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:51.500]   pretty good job i it's you know i'm watching it i'm watching it apple i've read an article about apple
[02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:59.820]   tv saying oh it's not about how much money they make on apple tv shocker it's all about apple
[02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:06.220]   services and apple tv is just one of a you know apple fit you cover that in uh you know connect
[02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:13.420]   with the watts and uh um the fitness thing apples i cloud all of the different services are doing
[02:27:13.420 --> 02:27:19.100]   quite well and it's just part of that overall uh success for apple they're trying to change turn
[02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:24.140]   from from a hardware company to a service company and in order to do that you have to have services
[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:30.780]   and apple tv plus is one of those services doesn't need to be better than netflix or more successful
[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:36.700]   in that place it just has to drive traffic as a package yeah it can actually be a little bit worse
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:42.700]   than its competitors and you know apple throws it on their devices when you get a new one so like
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:47.500]   it's a lot of people are gonna be like you're how do you compete against disney plus which has
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:54.060]   you know all these franchises you know you you Netflix has been in this for many many years
[02:27:54.060 --> 02:27:58.140]   of course apple tv is is not going to compete with them it doesn't have to though that's the
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:07.340]   that's the uh that's the good news um are you watching foundation yeah lacy you know i like it
[02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:14.540]   i i read the novels when i was a teenager i like it a lot i think it's beautiful i think they've done
[02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:22.540]   a really nice job yeah um i am enjoying it i think lee pace and sci-fi are always a good match
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:32.300]   oh i love lee pay yeah yeah so uh yeah so i'm happy i like jared uh harris too is wonderful
[02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:39.020]   yes really wonderful so yeah i like it i'm not the teddilasso fan you're the soccer fan uh
[02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:44.380]   necklace did you did you enjoy teddilasso seeing an american football what yeah my my my
[02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:50.940]   i'm not a big fan actually you watch apple tv uh i don't know what her her uh opinion would have
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:58.060]   been uh my boss loves teddilasso he's an american football fan uh pen state fan to be specific he loves
[02:28:58.060 --> 02:29:03.340]   teddilasso i have not seen it although i will say on on like reddit and you know various uh
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:08.300]   twitter's uh it definitely has a good reputation among the actual soccer fans oh that's interesting
[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:14.540]   like like hardcore it it is uh it is well done from what i understand uh and and people
[02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:20.620]   hardcore fans who like it i have just not i'm just not a big uh tv caught you know person i don't
[02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:25.180]   watch a lot there's a big battle brewing actually it's i think it might be over now between nbc
[02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:31.020]   universal and youtube google's youtube tv uh this is that this is that one of those another one of
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:37.820]   those carriage fights you see them all the time where um nbc universal says you need to pay us
[02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:42.700]   more and they have a lot of stuff they've got the locals they've got uh sports and youtube
[02:29:42.700 --> 02:29:49.180]   save tv says no we don't nbc says all right we're pulling off of youtube tv youtube tv says fine
[02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:55.100]   we'll charge customers ten bucks less a month that'll make them happy you eventually they made up
[02:29:55.100 --> 02:30:01.260]   they've reached an agreement i'm only saying that because i thought tonight was going to be the
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:08.940]   night because nbc is broadcasting the probably the most important nfl football game of the year
[02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:14.780]   except for the super bowl next year and that is tom brady's return to new england he's the tampa
[02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:21.260]   bay buck and ears are facing off the patriots in just a minute or two and that's on nbc and i really
[02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:26.700]   thought nbc it was just going to go right up to the wire and see if youtube would say would blink
[02:30:26.700 --> 02:30:34.940]   because of sunday night football um nope they made a deal youtube tv will continue to be 65 bucks
[02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:43.260]   a month which is ridiculous yeah uh nbc must have gotten something that they wanted um but that's
[02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:49.900]   the good news i guess we all we all win and we're not going to miss tom brady return to new england

[02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:09.420]   all that type of stuff it is a separate product a couple months for free and then afterwards it's
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:14.140]   four ninety nine a month uh but uh you know if you're a new homeowner and you don't you know this is
[02:32:14.140 --> 02:32:20.140]   such a good idea obviously no so yeah it is uh for someone like me i don't know anything about
[02:32:20.140 --> 02:32:24.860]   refrigerators or like roofs or anything uh and i am hoping to buy a house probably within the next
[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:30.060]   two years or so give or take uh i i definitely need this app because i don't know anything if a pipe
[02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:36.300]   explodes i'm i'm cooked so hopefully this app will kind of help you prevent that really happening by
[02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:40.620]   staying on top of maintenance all your maintenance that type of stuff yeah yeah you know as a long
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:46.940]   time home owner this is one of the hardest things to remember and stuff slips by i'm big on uh not
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:53.180]   deferring maintenance is this a new strategy for consumer union to do uh to do apps that's interesting
[02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:57.420]   i have no idea to be honest uh i just know that we launched it last week and uh i you know i've
[02:32:57.420 --> 02:33:02.540]   messed around with it it's pretty neat i don't own a home yet so uh not not for me yet but uh for the
[02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:06.940]   folks in the audience who are new homeowners or who will be soon uh maintenance is definitely
[02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:12.060]   a thing you need to stay on top of otherwise uh otherwise bad things happen so hopefully that helps
[02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:18.540]   upkept upkepthome.com or just look for it on android on the google play store on the mac
[02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:23.820]   ios store thank you great to have you Nicholas i appreciate it thank you go Barcelona

[02:33:43.180 --> 02:33:50.380]   summer. That's so weird. It's been very mismanaged for the past uh since 2015 or so so it is fairly
[02:33:50.380 --> 02:33:56.380]   self-inflicted that messy had to leave but yeah it's it's basically you've got states owning teams
[02:33:56.940 --> 02:34:04.060]   uh Qatar Abu Dhabi Chelsea team in England is owned by Roman Abramovinci who is one of the
[02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:10.620]   Russian oligarchs who when the Soviet Union collapsed he had like a gas interests that's why
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:16.460]   he's a billionaire so it's like it is very interesting like who owns what and you know you lose something
[02:34:16.460 --> 02:34:20.140]   there you know the locally owned teams who were they used to be competitive now they're not just
