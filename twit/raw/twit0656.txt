[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.300]   what happened
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.220]   with some of the best tech journalists in the business this is the uh... over
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.420]   fifty club today and i like doing this every once in a while
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.340]   get the senior tech journalists in the room
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.660]   to weigh in starting with mike algace because the covering the scene for
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.900]   several decades he's in france tonight
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.180]   and i mean to us because what it's like almost
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.540]   it's like midnight there
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.740]   it's getting toward midnight and here in france we uh... me and the french
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.540]   people here we just couldn't care less about the
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.380]   all really okay
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.060]   i guess that makes sense to push off the french have their own askers right there
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.340]   some sort of uh... french ceremony
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.580]   and jerry luis wins every year i know that's right
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.220]   not new
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.980]   anyway mike is great to have you he's doing his digital nomad thing uh... for
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.940]   which he is
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.500]   just leave famous
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.060]   and i will ask him a little bit uh... what what the plans are also with us
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.640]   from houston texas dweid silverman
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.140]   so glad dweid's back in the fold he
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.420]   he's a lapsed text journal tech journalists for a while
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.940]   i saw the air of my way is that
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.260]   i am on back baby am relieved he's the tech burger at the u_s_ and
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.660]   article
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.820]   uh... you should spell that with an h so you'd be like the mayor of tech
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.620]   that's what one of the things that it all it lets us do is we actually do
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.140]   have hamburger
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.900]   reviews and news
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.700]   on the tech burger page so every now and then
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.420]   like and on our twitter counter facebook account i'll throw up one of our
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.060]   food critics hamburger reviews and everybody goes
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.060]   uh...
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.700]   so it's it's it's it lets me do it a running inside joke that i'm the only
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.140]   person who gets it i can't go to your page it makes me too hungry i
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.740]   looks delicious that tech burger also here from c_b_s_ news radio
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.740]   larry i got it right larry maggot it's nice to see you larry
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.540]   uh... also long-time uh... journalist and you know this uh... over fifty uh...
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.780]   one of my facebook friends proposing a fifty over fifty you know how it
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.540]   forms a thirty under thirty-three-seven
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.300]   about that
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.820]   yeah one of the old guys you know they're so few of us that we all might make it
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.140]   in that way
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.380]   about the over fifty it's only fifty of us left
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.540]   that would be everybody
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.500]   seventy five over seventy five will definitely make that one
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   this is this is a reunion of sorts with larry and i larry and i co-wrote a
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.620]   book together was the first time i had been involved in a book
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.500]   yes we wrote a list of books
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.900]   i had no idea
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.340]   yes i had no idea i had no idea i had my mother bought one by dog bought one i
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.900]   think that white might have bought one that was it
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.380]   yeah
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.860]   well i i like truth is you know and i sure that there we have lots of young
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.820]   viewers and they always say you know you ought to get some people under twenty
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.580]   five and and that's fine
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.700]   and certainly people under twenty five have a perspective on tech
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.620]   but we've been around to watch it happen over the last few decades and i think
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.580]   there is something of value there too because i think yeah
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.260]   you get some perspective you don't jump when snapchat releases
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.300]   classes
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.900]   oh this is the next best thing of course might like those google
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.420]   goggles a lot the google class i do but the snap glasses are something
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.340]   entirely different i do not like those
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.380]   kids these days with their glasses pews
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.860]   annual study of uh actually they do it all the time but they they've come out
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.980]   with their their big findings about how young people
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.180]   uh use social media i don't know if you guys saw these
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.460]   graphs that came out yesterday uh but boy uh it's a shocker and it's not a
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.500]   shocker
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.860]   um i'm gonna go down to the youtube because that's one that's really
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.700]   interesting uh and pretend it comes down to age actually
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.140]   let me see if i can uh i can find it it it turns out
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.740]   where's the where's the breakdown by um oh here it is
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.700]   social platforms youtube facebook snapchat instagram and twitter now let me
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.940]   explain it because it's kind of a complicated
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.380]   graph the green dot is 50 plus you and me
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:26.660]   uh yep the dark green the dark blue is 18 to 24 and here is the gap
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.500]   so for instance the percentage of us adults in each
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.780]   age group who say they use youtube 94 percent
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.740]   of 18 to 24 year olds a little bit less for us old folks 56 percent
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.900]   80 percent uh actually the only place facebook
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.660]   doesn't do well is with people uh in their 60s
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:55.060]   facebook is is completely dominant 80 percent of people between 18 and 50
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.940]   80 percent 80 percent use facebook uh i think it's i this doesn't say but i
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.020]   think it's every every day yeah snapchat 78 percent
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.740]   instagram 71 percent there there's just no question
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.900]   that there's a younger trending thing with everything but facebook
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.220]   and i think what this really says this i think what this actually doesn't say
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.020]   is that each sort of age group has its own go-to
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.900]   main source of information about the world and i think that for older people
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.500]   it's television still yeah i think for younger people it's youtube for sure
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.260]   and so you really see this when you start asking people who are
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:45.380]   20 22 or whatever uh or younger about you know every day ordinary tv stars
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.620]   or movie stars whatever they don't necessarily know who those people are
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.540]   but the youtube stars they have an encyclopedic knowledge about these
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.820]   personalities and most of these names would be
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.660]   completely alien to all of us on this panel it's interesting you know i run
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.300]   safe for internet day every year and we're always trying to get a youtube
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.540]   star to you know come and be a speaker they charge as much for appearances of
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.700]   some of the hollywood stars i think these guys are
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.660]   you know hundreds sure all come and speak for hundred thousand dollars
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.220]   and by the way in the simple use if you go to the front page of uh
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.180]   connect safely dot org you'll find i have an article called
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.300]   teens and social media it's a mixed bag i go look at it
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.140]   and part of that is taking on this psychologist gene twenge i don't know
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.740]   if you've if you've covered that yes i have them yeah you know and one of the
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.100]   things that she shocked about is that as a result of social media young people
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.620]   are having less sex drinking less and driving less if if
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.020]   those are necessarily bad things or you know that that kids are doing that but
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.820]   um i i basically have taken on this whole argument and and part of i'm
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.180]   basing it on is what's happening in parkland florida i mean that's that's
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.060]   anecdotal it's just a few key kids but uh i am convinced that young people are
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.940]   more engaged in than than my generation was and
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.980]   i come from a pretty engaged baby bloomer generation
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.180]   and and not as socially isolated and i have no idea how much sex they're
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.140]   having but um i i don't you know maybe that's a good thing they're not
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.820]   having the much sex but we talked a lot about uh her book which is
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.100]   called i gen white today super connected kids are growing up less
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.420]   rebellious more tolerant less happy and completely unprepared for adulthood
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.660]   which is the ultimate link bait in fact she was so anxious to get link bait she
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.340]   threw in about 18 concepts in one subtitle but
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.260]   but we're subtitle ever yeah well kids in florida i mean i'm sorry those kids that
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.380]   are leading the the the anti you know the gun control
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.620]   movement it's pretty impressive are actually more like adults than the
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.380]   people who are running our country so that's right well and it's so i guess
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.500]   what you could say is that these are kids who understand
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.020]   deeply understand social media and actually as it turns out mainstream
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.500]   media and so because they're so activated by this issue
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.140]   are showing a real adeptness well the skills that they developed on both
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.380]   sides of the cell phone camera work on and mainstream media as well it
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.580]   doesn't matter whether you're doing a youtube video or you're on cnn if if
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.940]   you're telegenic and know how to talk to a camera those skills are going to work
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.580]   for you and they're they've proven they've also proven
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.260]   amazing mastery of social media and by the way i think emma gometh has
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.540]   far more follower than the n_r_a_ does which is pretty remarkable
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.700]   path you know one thing that the the the the pewling i don't think really
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.900]   addresses is it's not so much i think where they get their news but how they
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.580]   talk to each other um you know each of them each of the
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.860]   generations has a channel where they when they talk with their friends and
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.540]   their family and news just happens to be a part of it
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.700]   you you also see in a lot of these surveys and previous pew surveys
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.940]   that people don't think of oh i'm going to go to facebook to look at news that's
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.540]   not happens they go there to interact with their friends
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.060]   and if news that's interest them shows up
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.980]   uh you know it's gravy but i don't think that people like jump onto
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.420]   facebook and say let's see what the news is today well that and that may have
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.540]   changed quite a bit because facebook has changed its algorithm to
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.980]   yes kind of deprecate news the study did say they don't specifically address
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.260]   news but they did say now roughly two-thirds of us adults sixty eight percent
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.380]   say they are facebook users three-quarters of them
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.580]   on a daily basis so this this is actually really across all demographics
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.620]   facebook is is dominant but it's interesting this is how much power
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.780]   facebook wields uh they decide all of a sudden yeah we're not going to do so
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.220]   much news news a number of news organizations fold
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.900]   immediately the rest are suffering and and uh you know people still go to
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.980]   facebook it's it's it's not where they go for their
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.340]   nose it's just where they go for whatever is there right
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.700]   yeah there also have been a series of studies that have shown
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.860]   that search now is out performing in terms of referrals
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.580]   to new sites on social media yeah and and we've seen that we see that
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.100]   yeah at the chronicle what's also interesting is that at the same time
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.620]   actually on one day facebook said there'd be less news and then the next day
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.540]   they said there'd be more local news and we have seen some of that happening
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.900]   here as well that was a niemen lab a report that just
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.620]   recently in fact i think at the same time as this
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.020]   pew report came out showed that referral traffic from facebook and we knew
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.540]   this is becoming less important but that's not all bad actually i think
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.500]   they're talking about buzz sumo here which
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.420]   is a terrible name for an analytics company
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.780]   almost as bad as tech burger
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:37.780]   yeah but buzz sumo doesn't invoke a lovely image of a juicy hamburger
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.740]   that's right it evokes an image of a cocaine-addled
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.940]   wrestler i don't know what
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.180]   so in any event according to buzz sumo uh
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.140]   look at the shares here for instance of New York Times content
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.620]   uh going up and up and up some of that of course is
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.780]   is bolstered by the interest in politics uh in the last year
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.900]   but and they're getting a lot of their links as you said
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.380]   not from not from social sharing sites but in fact from
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.380]   search engines right which i find ironic because
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.620]   ripper burdock is filling google because he's complaining about the fact
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.580]   that they're linking to his sites which i never understood since it brings
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.780]   people in but so so he's now suing because he launched
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.580]   a feeling he's complaining he's complaining he launched the first
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.220]   shop by saying they ought to pay me right i don't know i mean i
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.500]   love it when people link to my article that's the whole idea of it to get to get
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.780]   viewers and and we've seen examples uh in europe work
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.140]   uh i was at germany or france where the uh publisher said
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.620]   no no more you can't link to us anymore and there
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.700]   it was spain and and then readership plummeted
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.820]   and they and they said oh i'm sorry forget i said
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.460]   please please link back to us we want that here's uh here's the telling uh
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.860]   graph the blue line is google referral traffic
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.460]   the green line is facebook referral traffic and the scale
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.260]   is over the last year so the the lines have completely shifted it was facebook
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.700]   on top and then and now facebook is well below google
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.380]   if anybody else funny facebook were boring since they changed the article
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.340]   yeah i never go to it i mean i just find i just
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.300]   seeing the same stories from the same people over and over again
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.220]   and i i it's done as diverse as it was before i liked all that all that link
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.940]   bait yeah really well i i use facebook primarily to keep
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.540]   up with my friends and people who are far away i use it actually much
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.580]   much less for news and as soon as i go into it
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.100]   i flip the feed so that it is uh prima lodge me too as opposed to algorithm
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.020]   and then you see a lot more the problem is it won't stick like that
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.500]   i know i know i know that's the that is the annoying part of it i think
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.060]   so uh let's see should i we talk more about social media use maybe
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.940]   there's some more tidbits in here well we did see facebook said at i think
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.980]   was that there quarterly results that they had two million
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:03.300]   a loss of two million users in the under 25 age group
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.660]   so i think there is some erosion among the younger people
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:11.540]   but they seem to be making that up with adults so and also with instagram which
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.540]   they owned so it's yeah and that's the best strategy isn't it right
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.020]   of course just buy some other things and now they got
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.660]   messenger kids so they can get even younger kids and
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.300]   as part of the fold snapchat 78 of 18 to 24 year olds
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:31.060]   use snapchat 54 as soon as they go over 24 although snapchat has issues right
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:36.020]   now with its redesign and people not being happy about that and kylie jennor
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.020]   let's kylie jennor and kylie jennor is not happy about that
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.260]   pinterest here's a surprise more popular with women
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.460]   who to thunk really yeah 41 percent of women say they use the site 16 percent
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.780]   of men right let's go to guest never would have thought
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.340]   uh latin america the number one area for what's app we knew that because when
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.460]   the brazil tried to shut down what's app what's
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.580]   practically a rebellion in the streets and they brought it back within 24 hours
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.140]   what's happened the weirdest thing that america
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.020]   uh it where america is out of step with the rest of the world because
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.140]   everyone in the world uses what's app except americans
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.580]   and everywhere we go around the world everyone's like what's your you know
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.460]   that's the primary way that people stay in touch with with each other and
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.780]   in the u.s. it's like you know maybe some people use it but almost nobody uses
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.380]   that as our primary means to stay and connect it to anyone is that
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.380]   purely economic because most self-applans have unlimited
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:40.980]   texting here but not in other countries i have no idea i have no idea why it
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.220]   is it i think what's app is big in latin america in europe but not in asia where
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.780]   line and we chat uh totally right dominant
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.060]   i don't know the most americans i know that use it use it to communicate with
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.020]   people overseas yeah they don't use it you know they keep it
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.660]   handy which by the way what's app is also owned by
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.900]   facebook right right right right i took them all off my phone because i
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.180]   don't want facebook uh to get any any additional data for me i still have
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.220]   accounts yeah but i just don't use them on my phone it's also because i was
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.420]   staying up late at night waking up in the middle of the night looking at
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.180]   instagram is not a good i i know quite a few people who have taken
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.540]   all of these social apps off of their phone and they now only use it on a
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.700]   computer and uh that's a really interesting i don't know how much of a
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.540]   trend that is but i have i know quite a few people who've done it and now you
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.740]   leo yeah but there are a lot of apps that you can't use on a computer that you
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.740]   have to use at a fault if you want to use them
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.940]   which which bothers me i wish they would i i'm one of these people who
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.780]   you know never goes anywhere without a laptop and i would rather use a
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.820]   computer for anything that requires typing but
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.060]   i guess i'm i'm i'm another old guy that uh at a touch with with with a young
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.660]   and are we at a disadvantage of the us because we have so many messaging
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.900]   platforms that that's fragmented i find that
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.220]   problem because you have to figure out the i would love it if everybody would use
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.380]   telegram for instance i would be i love the platform i would be very happy but
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.140]   i can't use it with all i only use with a handful of people who are on it
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.260]   imagine if back in the day when we were kids and you picked up the phone and you
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.620]   had to know what phone company the person and the other end was using in order
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.540]   to call them you know what the analog is is email
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.300]   remember in the early right you're old enough to remember mci mail and
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.140]   g email and you you couldn't email somebody across services
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.540]   cop you serve and and so you but then at some point i can't remember exactly
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.900]   when it happened once you could email everybody from any service
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.100]   that completely changed email for the better well you know
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.700]   you're bringing up an interesting uh interesting pet peeve of mine which is
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.460]   i think that they that the mobile world has set us back in a number of ways
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.700]   i remember when every communication services had its own piece of software
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.420]   right you want to go on prodigy use a prodigy software
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.460]   you want to go and copy serve you use air software and then there's this
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.100]   marvelous thing that came along called the worldwide web
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.900]   and suddenly every communication service we wanted
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.500]   with available on the same piece of software with a URL
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.340]   now in the mobile world it's a separate app for everything you want to do
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.860]   and so i actually think we've moved backwards and suddenly agree
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.820]   you know even like newspaper if i want to read the washington post
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.900]   it's all siloed i gotta get it's over the word back in the silo
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.820]   yeah one of the ways we've moved backwards is in advocacy because
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.420]   back in the old days when uh i rc and and uh aim and all these different
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.140]   chat messaging uh services were incompatible there's a lot of
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.380]   pressure by the using public for them to unite and figure out how to be
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.420]   cross-platform and so on and you don't see that at all nobody's
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.340]   calling on facebook to be compatible with twitter and all these other social
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.620]   networks uh and we should be we we should be
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.460]   trying to squeeze the social networks so that you can go to a single social
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.980]   now i mean remember that facebook purchased what was it
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.620]   friendster feedster whatever it was uh which was an attempt to unify
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.340]   different social networks they bought it and killed it
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.500]   because the last thing they want is for people to be able to interact
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.540]   with multiple social networks all in one platform it's sure i mean there are
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.900]   ways your twitter feed can show up on facebook but i don't know any way for
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.340]   example that maybe other people do to exchange photographs between
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.140]   instagram and snapchat and it seems to me you're right you should just choose
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.220]   the platform you want to use use rather than having to choose it based on what
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.860]   your friends are using and that's actually you know we studied
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.580]   some of these social media apps and it's not the app
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.420]   that drives people to a particular uh platform it's what their friends are
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.100]   using and so if all your friends are on snapchat you're going to be on snapchat
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.820]   as opposed to just picking whatever platform you enjoy using it's a
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.740]   challenging balance because uh another example here will be restaurant
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.740]   reservation apps and i'm not advocating by the way for somebody in the
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.300]   charms said you're advocating monopoly no quite the opposite i'm
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.980]   advocating a standard right because if you had a standard then you
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.220]   could use any app you liked better than any other app but they'd be
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.700]   inter-abled interoperate most of the mail is
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.860]   travel arrangement yeah expedient orbit it doesn't matter they all take you to
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.660]   the same database yeah but that's because you're ordering from the same
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.740]   people ultimately so right but email is a better example you you know you can
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.260]   use any email client you want but there's email standards and that's how you
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.100]   interact with one another restaurant reservation so here's the pros and
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.580]   cons if you're a restaurant uh you know there
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.380]   there are other considerations like how much it costs how much of your
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.260]   profits you have to give to them that's one of the problems open table has a
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.860]   lot of restaurants hate open table but if you're a restaurant you'd like to be
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.660]   on some digital reservation system as a user though i have to
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.180]   figure out which system that restaurant uses
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.060]   some use resi some use open table there more and more and there's going to be
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.780]   this proliferation and that makes all of them less useful it hurts all of them
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.500]   so there's an economic incentive for you know apple and google and
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.540]   facebook to say use our product and none other
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.220]   but at the same time you can get to unless you have dominance
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.420]   it could hurt you in the long run because then nobody wins right
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.860]   and we're talking about generational differences in attitudes and in terms of
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.500]   what people do our generation we're a bunch of
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   of attention whores we want to be able to reach everybody like we want a one to
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   many megaphone to reach everybody and that's why it's a problem for us
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.100]   that there's not a single platform where we can post and everybody on all our
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.460]   friends on twitter facebook google plus instagram etc etc
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.900]   can see that same post that's a problem for us but for young people
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.540]   they don't want a megaphone they don't want to uh they want they don't want
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.580]   one to many communication they want to find a place where they're
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.020]   twelve friends or eight friends or whatever are there and just have this
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.860]   small group communication in general i'm generalizing that's changing though
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.420]   because you're seeing for instance somebody's pointing this out also in the
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.380]   chair that a lot of people are using the snapchat filters
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.460]   saving them and then posting them on instagram the competitors platform
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.940]   so i think young people even want by the way this shows turn into exactly what
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.900]   i thought it would which is a bunch of old folks complaining about the kids
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:02.820]   today but i do think young people ultimately i think everybody if they
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.580]   can experience it would want open platforms well the you know the step
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.620]   for the companies who are profiting off closed plans right
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.980]   well you know we're we're complaining that we want interoperability
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.540]   but you don't hear everybody else complaining about it and there's
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:22.900]   a which means that for them it's working you know apple apple is kind of a good
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:28.500]   example of of how it works um you know the the closed the walled
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.220]   garden uh apples buy it where lock in where you end up having
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.740]   you know you if you i think probably the perfect example of this is
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.700]   the messages app where if you're talking to someone who's using an iPhone or
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.140]   an i-device or a mac and you're texting at them
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.020]   using that you have this pleasant blue and then when you're talking to someone
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.220]   who is using an android or some other device
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.220]   it's this like barberly green you know it's like it looks barbaric
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.740]   barbarians and they and they make the video and
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.500]   pictures like less lower quality right which is another
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.540]   problematic apple is but apples the king of the ecosystem lock in
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.900]   they know exactly how to do it but i would submit that
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.140]   that the the this is one but i think there are other data points the fact
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.660]   that people use snapchat to create something and then save it on instagram
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.060]   shows that even though they don't know to say the way the words open platform
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.940]   that's really what people want they want to use the right tool for the right
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.180]   job they just don't know what to call it
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.580]   because they've never experienced it what i want those is grand lock in
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.940]   what they also don't know is instagram has the same filters
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.620]   so they're using snapchat filters they're stealing them all
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.260]   what it doesn't have though snapchat really owns
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.180]   this this face thing where you could put stuff on there nobody does it better
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.420]   than snapchat apples trying to with animatrix
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.860]   message your kids did a pretty good job on it did it if you're on your 13 yeah
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.740]   for kids so how do you stand on messenger kids because this
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.820]   seemed to me to be the most naked grab for power of all facebook created
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.860]   oh geez kappa prevents us from making under 13 year olds use our platform
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.740]   i know we'll create messenger i am kids all right now you got me on a on a
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.500]   roll here i am i am a big fan of messenger kids really have to disclose
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.940]   that facebook is a supporter of my nonprofit connect safely at orgo we have
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.140]   to say that but but you know i've been involved with involved in in
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.020]   pre-briefing and actually in some ways calling for it
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.060]   over a period of years with those guys trying to get them to do a program
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.660]   project for people under 13 and what i like about messenger kids is number
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.740]   one it's totally under parents control the parents required to set up an
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.100]   account the parent has to approve every single contact
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.740]   it is not a social media platform it is a messenger messaging platform
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.500]   designed so kids can talk to their family and other children
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:51.060]   it has delightful you know gifts and uh masks and other other fun things you
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.260]   can do with it and unless the parents screws up
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.740]   it's completely safe now a parent can go ahead and let your creepy uncle
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.340]   communicate with you but that's on the parent it's not on facebook facebook
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.860]   has given parents complete control my and finally is you shouldn't get kids on
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.860]   these messenger platforms at all they're on it anyway don't if you believe in
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.900]   that then they shouldn't have devices the fact is that millions and millions of
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.940]   young kids have devices and once they get a device
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.060]   they're going to find some kind of messaging platform to play with
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.740]   and if it's not facebook kids messenger kids it's going to be snapchat
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.180]   or instagram where they shouldn't be yeah that's a good point
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.660]   that's my opinion for a commercial free childhood a bunch of experts
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.740]   pediatricians child psychologists wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg saying
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:41.060]   please discontinue messenger kids younger children are simply not ready to
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.260]   have social media accounts they're not old enough to navigate the complexities
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.020]   of online relationships at a time when there's manning concern about how
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.500]   socially media use effects adolescents well-being it's particularly irresponsible
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.780]   to encourage children as young as preschoolers to start using a facebook
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.300]   product maybe the answer is if you're if you're a
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.380]   certain age Larry like if you're nine or ten you're old enough to
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.460]   have a device and one device yes but but there's kids five years old using
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.660]   facebook messenger yeah but you know i just came back from the facebook
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.540]   global safety seminar washington was actually on Thursday and we had
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.500]   pediatricians we had there are plenty of experts i mean
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.260]   my own i mean i i don't like calling myself an expert but i've been the child
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.180]   safety space now for 20 years and there are plenty of people who would
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.420]   argue that messenger kids is not a is a good thing now like
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.300]   anything else it has to be done with parental control
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.500]   it you can't let the kids spend too much time using the device there's all
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.700]   sorts of things that parents need to do but the mere fact
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.460]   that you're letting kids interact with their friends and their family
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.540]   i don't know i i think that i just don't agree with these folks that
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.180]   are making a big play on this i mean they have a right to do it and i've you
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.420]   know i've respectfully disagreed in in in federal public forums
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.700]   including uh including on Larry thrall dot com good
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.020]   and then there's viro
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.100]   we do we need another social media app this is the social media app
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.540]   that has been around for several years but for some reason
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.860]   that i don't really understand suddenly i know the reason oh tell me it suddenly
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.700]   took off uh they were offering free for life
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.620]   subscriptions for the first million users uh that's the reason it's up to
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:22.340]   it's up to three million now and they said due to extraordinary demand we're
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.220]   gonna extend this offer is that the reason because it's free
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.140]   but i think it's something that might not be yeah i i as it approached the
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.620]   million people are thinking well if if this thing blows up and suddenly this
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.060]   is the social net on it now cost twenty dollars a year for the
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.060]   rest of my life might as well sign up and those signups caused
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.060]   an avalanche of users at which caused some news reports and people started
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.020]   discovering so i i really think it's nothing more than that
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:52.420]   now they had so many problems with new signups that they actually extended the
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.500]   free uh for life thing and i think they've solved their
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.340]   server issues i i've been using it for a week and it seems to be fine
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.860]   yeah i do like it that it's more content focused when you when you
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.540]   yeah start to put a post up it really encourages you to share
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:12.020]   about a book or a movie or a picture there are a lot of beautiful images on
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:16.500]   it it's a pretty looking uh program it also has some nice
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:21.140]   privacy controls you choose whether people you are following our close friends
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.540]   friends acquaintances or followers and you can share it with either publicly
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.740]   or with a small group uh it's very pretty i actually took it off my phone because
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.940]   too many people were joining it and i was getting non-stop notifications
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.700]   yeah and they don't have a family category which is a little weird
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.380]   that would be nice yeah go around there what's great about it is it
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.100]   it basically reminds you of how stupid instagram is so yeah
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.980]   instagram you can't put links you can't do like though you have all these
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.340]   artificial limitations designed to keep you locked in this has google plus
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.540]   style threaded conversation not threaded but conversations as well you can have
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.580]   comments on there here's the issue though and i'm really curious what you
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.060]   guys think about this because i've been debating it with everybody here at
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.300]   dwitt there is some question about its founder
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:12.420]   you know he's he's the son of the former lebanese prime minister
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:18.500]   yeah he's a billionaire he there was uh this is the gizmodo article that kind
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.860]   of started at all and i don't i have not done any research
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:28.020]   he denies this uh but there is gizmodo says that there's some evidence that he
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.460]   has previous startup uh didn't pay its employees left people to starve
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:39.140]   did some nasty stuff um i don't know if we can prove or disprove that
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.580]   there are plenty of people defending him on viro
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.180]   and but i guess my question is should we care
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.620]   about the provenance of a program like viro
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.780]   well i think you don't want to enable somebody who has done bad things to do
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.460]   it again i think that's that's the main concern there are other issues with
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.060]   this too and that is if you look at the terms of service
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.380]   it gives them complete rights to do anything with any of the content that
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:11.220]   you upload in perpetuity uh to a degree that is not found in a lot of other
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:15.620]   it's worse than instagram's uh adores than instagram works worse than facebook's
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.940]   and facebook at one point had the same type of language and
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.180]   we were doing things like if you remember the flap where they were taking
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.780]   people's faces and putting them next to products and say right so it's right
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.820]   likes so that would appear and they i hated that
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.780]   you know in theory do that based on okay um on the way this is worded so
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.740]   that's something to be aware of that's maybe that's more concerning to the
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.900]   argument and of course do then there's another question is do we need
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.380]   another social network and will this be another
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.060]   example of a flash in the pan social network that everybody joins but nobody
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.940]   uses and everybody goes back to facebook and twitter afterwards like
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.460]   yellow like yellow yeah i mean i can go on and on like
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.740]   mastodon which is the twitter clone that everybody was excited about
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.940]   only only if there's a backlight i mean you know that we're going through a
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.500]   tech backlash now and i don't think it's affected
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.740]   at least adult users of facebook but if this backlash gets to a point where
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.940]   people feel that facebook is a inundating us with too much advertising
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.100]   or b taking away our privacy or c putting us in the hands of russian
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:22.180]   manipulators and i could see some interest in people going off to a
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.420]   different type of platform that's less reliant on advertising and perhaps
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.780]   more reliant on a subscription basis i don't think you're talking about
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.460]   hundreds of millions of users but i could definitely see people wanting
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.140]   some people wanting to move into a premium service being willing to pay
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.900]   for it in exchange for them at least having the the sense
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.820]   that they're getting better privacy i like the idea of advertising i what i
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.300]   don't like is algorithmic sorting so what i want which by the way they say they
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.940]   don't do vera says we won't do that this is a
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.700]   which is a fantastic timeline yeah right but everyone else does it and it's
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.180]   considered a as a sort of a technological advantage to be able to do that really
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.180]   well but the problem is what i want is to be able to follow people and get the
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.340]   things that they post that's what i want and it's like impossible
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.940]   to find something like that they're always messing around with it and give me
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.020]   posts of people that i don't follow they're taking away post of people i do
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.940]   follow because they their algorithms decide that i don't need to see it
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.060]   i'm tired of that bs what i'd like to see is like a
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.700]   something like a bit torn or something a distributed peer-to-peer
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.100]   non-commercial social network where the data is distributed like
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:37.300]   uh you know like like bit torn is but the interface is governed by some sort
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.020]   of open source thing and and just get away from these
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.380]   gigantic companies that are just making a money handover fist
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.380]   manipulating our emotions so if there is so you think there's an opportunity for
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.660]   an alternate social network now that that does it right
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.940]   and that people we know i don't
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.740]   it's just what he was
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:01.140]   google plus was going to be that right well there was a startup a few years ago
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.020]   that was reacting to facebook i can't read the name of it it was a low
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:08.260]   diaspora so this is funny at the bottom of the gizmodo article about viro
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.460]   there's other links you might be interested in whatever happened to
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.900]   facebook killer diaspora what is l_o_ and should i even bother
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:19.140]   what is path what is google gab the twitter clone for trolls
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:23.780]   what is peach these are all failed social networks designed to replace
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.380]   these yes
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.980]   the only difference is this backlash that's going on right now and i don't i don't
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.700]   know how much is a different time it's a different time
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.900]   but i don't know if it's going to pick up enough steam to drive people into the
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.340]   arms of of a competitor but but it but it is happening you know what i
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.740]   predict facebook i think the backlash is against
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:44.180]   social not against those prejust those particular sites but against
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.300]   social in general at least that's what i feel like in my life
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.060]   i actually am glad not to visit twitter every day
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:55.300]   uh facebook every day and i put viro on here i thought it's beautiful it's nice
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.140]   i really like the platform but i don't want to spend time there either i i
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:03.220]   think there may be a backlash that doesn't transfer everybody to the next
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.820]   social thing but people may just have had enough of social we've seen some very
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.540]   negative impacts on on their lives there was a
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.580]   a piece from the uh i believe it was the conversation
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:18.260]   which is uh a uh site that kind of puts together thinkers and uh and uh
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.700]   different people doing essays about society
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.860]   wanted they had a really great piece uh at the end of last year called
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.460]   and and blitzer the headline i put on it because i ran it on tech burger but
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.260]   it was 2017 colin the year we fell out of love with our smartphones
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.780]   and it was kind of it was essentially when we began to look at
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:42.100]   the devices is taking up too much time robbing us of real life
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.260]   uh you know a lot of blame of what happened in the 2016 election i think
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.540]   falls on social networks on mobile and uh and i think that there is
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.780]   among thinkers and talkers and doers i think there's a backlash
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.300]   you know you don't see a lot of i think of mainstreamers
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.980]   uh complaining on facebook about how they're on facebook too much
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.060]   yeah that's the uh that's the post and i don't think that you know
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.020]   however people are cognizant of the backlash and i think over time
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:17.140]   um i think you're going to see um usage cut back and even even
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:21.220]   mark succerberg has said you know he spent less time on facebook
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.260]   right so um i think he actually advocated
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.700]   he's actually argued that people should spend less time on facebook now
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.380]   how he means that of another question but that was a big conversation that came
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:35.220]   up again at this global safety summit is uh you know somebody said if facebook
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:39.380]   like a tobacco company or like a chocolate company oh interesting you know
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.740]   a notion so tobacco's purpose is uh you know there's no such thing as a
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.180]   the modest amount of smoking you know one cigarette's bad for you
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.300]   whereas chocolate you know chocolate's great in moderation and
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.500]   kill you if you too much of it i think maybe it's not that you know on the one
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.300]   hand maybe we are tiring of it on the other hand i think
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.060]   we're as likely to give up facebook and twitter as we are to give up coffee
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:03.780]   it's i think it's a really bad yeah the really bad news is that we're i
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:08.580]   think we're kind of plateaued with social networking and on smartphones
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.300]   and we're just in this holding pattern until
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.260]   something really addictive comes up and which is
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.900]   social augmented reality yep through glasses yep i think and and also
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.100]   virtual reality eventually but i think these i think the various
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.780]   realities are going to be so addictive so compelling and so
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.300]   all-encompassing that the uh we're going to look back fondly
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.940]   at the era when people thought they predicted the smartphones i think well
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.820]   those are the days everything was fantastic remember when you could see
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.900]   people's eyes remember that gee it's too bad it's too bad facebook doesn't
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:43.780]   own oculus yeah yeah well and we are we are prime
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.820]   for this because you walk down the street you go to a restaurant
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.540]   all you see is people looking at their phones they're not looking at each other
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:53.780]   and i talk to each other i just constantly amazes me i'll go to a
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.220]   restaurant and there's a family sitting there and nobody's looking
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.260]   all on the phone you know what i think you have to be try to ask
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.900]   directions when you're walking down the street of a city and you want to ask
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.340]   directions everybody's either on their phone or have headphones on there's
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.540]   nobody who's actually present yeah you can walk up to and say hey i don't
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.140]   want to get to 33 and feel that feels like a pathology
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.020]   don't ask on your phone you know just check yeah go to google maps
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:20.500]   but i have to say it's a it's kind of an american thing and i think to a
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.260]   certain extent uh an asian you know japanese korean chinese thing
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.260]   um here in france you never see anyone i like i'm the only person i've ever
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:33.300]   seen where air pods or earbuds in public in france or greece or any number of
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.100]   countries people are not buried in their phones
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.020]   in many european countries this is not happening okay because that's interesting
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.380]   because i remember sitting outside of Notre-Dame in Paris
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:47.060]   10 years ago and seeing everybody walking around looking at their phones and i
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.460]   was flabbergasted this is before they're all tour
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.820]   they're all visitors no no this is before it was happening in the u.s
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.740]   text messaging was very big in europe before it happens first right and
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.820]   and i maybe they've just gone to maybe that's the future because maybe they've
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:06.820]   come full circle ahead of us i it's anyway you guys are doing exactly
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:12.340]   what i was afraid of the modern world i hate it
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.180]   i love it no you guys are great you guys are great we're i'm so so glad we could

[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:35.060]   uh let's see we were we were talking about
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:40.340]   social media and smartphones wall street journal had an interesting article i
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.740]   think it was yesterday apparently smartphone sales are starting to go
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:49.940]   down yep is it the price going up or the fact that people just don't feel like
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.940]   they need a new phone i i think it's the ipad problem i think it's the tablet
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:59.540]   problem where phones are great they last for a long time the new
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.740]   features are not compelling either they're theoretically amazing but they
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.860]   don't allow you to do anything differently really
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.900]   and so people think well i'll just hang on to my phone for maybe two or three
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.180]   years instead of one or two years yeah i think you're absolutely right i mean
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.660]   you know they the improvements in the camera which is you know it's
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:20.580]   interesting watching the galaxy s9 introduction it was all about the camera
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.780]   and undoubtedly it's a much better camera but there's a limit i mean it's
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.540]   at the limit it's like people are already pretty happy with their phone pretty
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:31.220]   happy with the cameras and their phones and to go out and spend close to a
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.580]   thousand dollars which is what one of these premium phones costs even
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.540]   you know apples the only one that you got above a thousand but they all
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:41.220]   approach that price that that's a big ticket item it's it's like buying a new
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.740]   refrigerator and why would you buy a new refrigerator if you need one still
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.500]   working right i haven't bought it for years yeah and there's so much else to
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.300]   buy their drones they're like cameras they're home
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.260]   automation like you know that the consumer electronics
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.820]   dollar is i buy a new drone every month
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:03.140]   who doesn't say crash it every month no i finally sworn off drones i have
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:07.380]   finally crashed my last drone i'm not buying anymore drones i did buy the s9
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:11.780]   but i'm different because i have to review it right it's interesting dxomark
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.940]   gave it its highest score ever uh but because everybody looks at the top
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.620]   level number at dxomark 99 which bests the
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:25.700]   iphone 10 and the google pixel 2xl but if you break it down uh for instance if
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.420]   you look at and this is what i find very interesting
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.340]   uh if you look at stills the pixel 2xl is better
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.820]   if you look at uh low light performance the iphone 10 might be better
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.900]   it's a it's it's a mixed bag there isn't really a best phone anymore you
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:44.100]   can't just you all look good they're all very good
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.340]   and that's the point frankly your galaxy s6 is very good
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:52.740]   your iphone 7 is very good and so i think you're right i think there's
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.420]   the only thing that they haven't broken through is killer battery life when i
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:00.100]   get a phone that says it's gonna work for five days on a single charge
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:04.180]   that'll get my attention you know motor roller the moto exploit
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.780]   was really amazing battery life and i don't notice it sold particularly
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.820]   well i'm not convinced that that's really what people want all
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:15.060]   other things have to be right right right so what's interesting
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.780]   about the last work this is the colons and this is
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:22.340]   hold on Dwight i might just said something it can't be true say that again
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.100]   yeah daracell is coming out with a phone that that has a 16
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:31.940]   thousand milliamp hour battery wait 50 pounds that's four that's four times
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:37.060]   the no date energizer energizer energize is jack epic but
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.580]   it the the battery life is supposed to be like five or six days
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:45.220]   so this will be the test of other people i'm with you i just like you i always say
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.380]   oh if they'd only come out with a better battery
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:52.340]   but i suspect that's not really driving so if energizer can sell this by this
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:55.940]   product yeah it also has to be able to carry it i mean if
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.340]   it's portable or do you need a wheel bit yeah that's gonna be pretty heavy
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:04.580]   to that so the irony of the drop in the in sales of this
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.540]   and you know the decline of the market comes at a time
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:14.740]   when you no longer have the the uh plans that are two years with subsidized
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:17.700]   pricing people aren't spending as much and and
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.460]   i hear people complaining about the price but ultimately you're
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:25.860]   when you are most people aren't buying it outright you know apple and at and t
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.540]   and horizon all have their next plans that don't
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.940]   uh charge interest so you're paying it per month and when you quit paying for
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:37.780]   it the hardware cost goes away which was not the case with the subsidized
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:42.500]   things and in theory with the with apple plan you could walk in every year and
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:47.060]   hand of your old phone and get the new phone and you could have a new phone
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:52.660]   every year and if you don't go up in tears so that you know you're getting a
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.260]   more a fancier phone or one with more memory the cost will be about the same
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.740]   per month it's like leasing the phone and i'm
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:04.020]   kind of surprised that that hasn't offset some of these sales because again you
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:08.100]   could have if you care you could have the latest phone every year and it's not
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:12.260]   going to hurt your pocketbook that much i'm surprised when people don't do that
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.620]   actually i don't do it if anybody should do it i should
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.900]   you know the other way to do it the other way to do it is to buy your own new phone
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.420]   and then sell your old phone right and i don't i haven't done the math to
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.860]   compare and and it's easy to do that you go to gazelle yeah we can sell you a
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.460]   lot that's easy something yeah no that's what we do we gazelle if you if you're
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.500]   ambitious you can go to ebay and sell it yourself that's a little more work and
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.020]   you probably get a little more money but yeah that kind of subsidizes it and
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.060]   my i guess the reason i don't do the long-term leases i'm worried about
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.380]   breaking the phone or damaging the phone plus there are family members
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:47.700]   who get my hand be downs actually there's also employees who get my hand be
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:53.380]   down so there's a ready market for the used handsets and i have a lot i get
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:57.540]   probably four or five used handsets a year because i'm trying all the phones
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:01.140]   uh display mate like the s9 they said it's the closest thing to a perfect
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.900]   screen they've ever seen
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:10.580]   uh they said it's better than any other screen including your 4k HDR screen
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:17.380]   they they raved over the how how does the average person uh tell the
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.700]   difference between yesterday's best screen that's exactly right today's i mean
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:26.340]   are absolutely right right it's they they look they all look fantastic all
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.740]   high-end phones in the last two or three years look
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:32.420]   absolutely breathtaking so you'll attack your lonely two laptops that were
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.980]   identical except for one headache um an ultra high definition display and
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:41.380]   the other one had a full definition display and the only negative side is
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.300]   the ultra definition with more expensive and battery much battery life yeah
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:49.540]   now when i look at them together right side by side i can tell the difference
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:54.180]   but the moment i put away the ultra high def and walk on walk around and look
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.140]   at the one with a regular one it looks terrific to me
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.860]   i don't even care i you know i watch movies on it
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:03.540]   and i and even when i was testing both of them i didn't bother walking across the
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.940]   room to get the ultra high definition it just didn't add up to anything that
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.300]   really increased my appreciation of that whatever i was watching so
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.820]   i i agree i think that that you know and again i'm a sound like an old foggy
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.940]   here almost like a luddite but i do think that it's almost like
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:22.740]   adam wasborn's uh infamestation statement sometimes adequacy is sufficient
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:26.420]   right that having the best and the greatest isn't necessarily
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.540]   something that everybody's going to appreciate actually i think you sound
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.500]   not like an old foggy but like a real person i think one of the
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:36.820]   hazards would be a tech journalist we are so enamored of the new right we get
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.340]   all the stuff to play with yeah that we forget that normal people
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.540]   are not you know they're buying refurbed phones they're buying you know
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.620]   that in this wall street journal article they quote uh somebody's saying it's like
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:51.140]   a Mercedes i want a Mercedes but i don't want i'm not going to buy the brand
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.860]   new Mercedes off the lot i'm going to wait a couple of years and buy it
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:58.260]   used and then i'll be driving a Mercedes it'll just be two years old Mercedes
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.860]   they think that that's what's happening with except for i think but the irony is
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.060]   in cars and this is the whole other program that actually is where the
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.820]   innovation is taking place and i'm thinking the next time i get a car i
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.820]   might lease it because unlike the past they used to keep my cars for 10 years
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.340]   but now 10 years from now today's cars are going to seem really old
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:20.180]   right lisa wouldn't let me buy this tesla outright because she's and she was
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.380]   right by the way shortly after i took delivery of the model 10
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.420]   the model x i'm sorry wait i mean it's iphone 10 and mama x i have a model x
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:32.580]   uh this thing they came out with a completely new platform
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:36.820]   and my car was obsolete literally a month after i took but it really said
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.100]   but fortunately released it and so i'll then you know begin
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:45.380]   so this is i mean this is the kind of ad copy that a company would drool
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:51.540]   over from display mate uh this galaxy s9 display performance
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.820]   sets many new display performance records including absolute color
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:58.420]   accuracy that is visually indistinguishable from
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.940]   perfect and almost certainly considerably better
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:07.380]   than your existing smartphone your living room 4k ultra hd tv your tablet
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:10.980]   your laptop and computer monitor there in other words it's their highest ever
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:15.940]   a plus grade and you're exactly right mike everybody goes hey that's really
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:20.580]   cool and what's wrong with this one or actually when they come out the next
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.940]   one what are they going to tell us about the screen then oh this that one was
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:30.020]   perfect or the perfect perfect here but but i for one one of the
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:34.260]   reasons i got into this business is so because i do want to see what they mean
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.980]   and i want that phone because then i could say this is the
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:41.860]   perfectest display ever made it's perfecter yeah yeah
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.060]   that's just my it sounds like Donald trumpeth writing the ad copy
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.100]   perfecter it's even better than perfect
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:52.900]   believing one disappointment in tech a good article
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.820]   came out today and motherboard and uh and uh part of vice motherboard this
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:01.220]   great uh where carl bode writing eight years later google fiber a faint echo
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.380]   of the disruption we were promised here's an example of something that we
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:09.300]   thought eight years ago was going to change the way we got internet
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:14.740]   and it turns out uh that you know google's pretty much backed off they went
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:20.260]   through several ceos the ceo now uh comes from the cable industry
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:24.020]   they've stopped expanding they've stopped adding cities
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:28.100]   there are fewer than 100 000 subscribers to google fiber tv
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.340]   which is the tv service writing on top of this part of it though you can
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:38.420]   you can blame on the the current incumbents who right have so much
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:43.380]   clout as we know in congress and state legislatures they were able to keep
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.500]   google from using the their utility polls they were locked out
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:52.100]   yeah i thought you were going to say because the current incumbents are also
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:56.260]   offering in some cases may get internet they're doing and and
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.620]   that brings up the same issue we were talking about display so i don't have
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.900]   gigabit internet i i i have 200 200 megabit
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.260]   you have plenty and and that's the thing i have plenty and
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.220]   it's funny because i've been thinking about going from i'm on Comcast now
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.340]   and i'm thinking i could save money by going to 18t
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.460]   which only offers 50 megabit and there's something inside me that says no no
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.620]   there's no way i'm going to cut my performance by by 75 percent
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:23.220]   but the reality is that if i did go to 50 megabit it would still be adequate
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:28.100]   for my needs and i probably don't have three teenagers in your basement all
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.500]   watching youtube netflix and you know you know you don't have
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.100]   there are how that's simultaneously yeah there are plenty of households where
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.700]   there are four or five heavy users all you know at once
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.140]   right yeah i mean that's that's common in our house we own there's only three of
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.060]   us but we're watching probably three hd streams
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.540]   and and we are two and we are 200 of the way you know it works per i don't know
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.620]   whether 50 would be adequate for that but our 50
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:57.140]   might we have plenty of bandwidth without the gigabit so
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.100]   even though i would even though if gigabit were available i'd probably get it
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.820]   it just happens of course you would you'd be crazy
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:07.620]   we have 10 gigabits down and up here we can't use that there's no machine in
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.340]   the building they can use more than a gigabit but i got it
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:16.660]   have it so i i think this article kind of article touches on this but i i take
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:21.300]   issue with the the premise of it i think google fiber was very disruptive
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.820]   mainly because i don't think we would be at one gigabit
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:29.140]   with Comcast and at at if they hadn't done it i know that when
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:34.740]   they came into Austin it completely tore up the uh the market there and at
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.620]   and t quickly rushed in and did one gigabit and they even offered it here
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:44.180]   at houston out of fear that google fiber might come here
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.180]   so even though they didn't show up here just the possibility that google fiber
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:52.020]   would come in at and t and comcast both now offer
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:57.220]   gigabit services and i think that you can thank google google fiber for that
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.660]   but i think you know that but so Austin was always going to have
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.620]   fantastic internet connectivity i think that
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:08.420]   the failure comes from the idea that i think deep down we kind of hoped that
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:13.300]   the rural rural areas in the united states would sort of leapfrog go from
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.340]   horrible to wonderful but in fact that never happened so
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.980]   that's not rich got richer in terms of bandwidth
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.860]   well and if you want a positive spin on it
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:25.220]   it could very well be that everybody's waiting google certainly waiting to
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:28.580]   see what 5g offers because and that will help rural areas
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.860]   wireless is always good for rural areas you don't have to trench you don't have
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.300]   to put anything on poles you could just beam it into the area
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:39.780]   do you think that that 5g will actually take the place of wired internet do you
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   think that it was a significant number of people
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.260]   will use 5g at home instead of you know instead of their wired broadband
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:51.540]   mmm-hmm no you don't your question is two there's two answers
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:56.180]   the first answer is what is 5g and when the hell is it going to happen
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.900]   and is it going to happen as they promise remember what they promised with
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.340]   lte remember what they promised with 3g remember what they i mean
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:08.260]   but if 5g lives up to its promise the one of the promises of 5g
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:12.900]   is that you would essentially be using a wireless connection it's as fast as a
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:17.060]   local hard drive exactly which would totally change
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:20.740]   you're you're thinking i just ordered the first windows on arm
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:24.740]   laptop from hp hb coming in a couple of weeks it's overpriced
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.420]   it's the hp nv8x2 it's a thousand dollars
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.500]   uh but it has a qualcomm gigabit chip and it has lte
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:37.300]   it's a pound and a half it only has 120 gigs of storage it doesn't have much
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.060]   storage but it has 22 hour battery life they claim and that's one of the
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.340]   reasons i bought it to see if it does that is
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:49.220]   interesting not maybe so much now but what if 5g comes along
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:52.980]   and now suddenly you're no matter where you are
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.020]   right operating at full speed with a total connection
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.380]   that could be changing life changing but i don't know if it's going to happen
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.980]   fine just a market right term well it also depends on pricing and
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.980]   whether they're going to charge you by you know whether they're going to charge
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:08.100]   you for data and how much i mean that could have a huge impact
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:12.180]   somebody one way to share them twisted mr says that hp
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:15.620]   that windows on arm hp is going to cost you an arm and a leg
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.420]   boom it is a 999 which is a little pricey for four gigs of ram and under
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.980]   twenty eight on the other hand it's cheaper than my laptop and it's a
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:26.180]   heck of a lot lighter you know i just think it's really
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.140]   like it's really portable it comes with a pen it comes with a
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:33.780]   keypad so what a thousand bucks is maybe not as horrible as it sounds
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:37.620]   but the main reason i want to see what the battery life is and i want to see if
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.820]   it's usable snapdragon 835 is that as usable
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.740]   as say an Intel core m processor is it more is it less
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:48.500]   i plan to bring this one to japan with me this will be my travel and
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.420]   the small hard drive with small ssd seems like a deficit but actually
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.780]   you don't need to have all of your data with you all of the time and it's more
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:58.660]   than enough yeah it's more than enough for your software in your operating
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.580]   system whatever data you're working with well i had some micro sd card slot so
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:05.940]   i'm going to put up a link yeah you can add that yeah sure i'll put it
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.700]   so yeah i don't think that i don't think that 5g is going to be the savior
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:13.140]   for rural users i think you still have to get
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:15.940]   the infrastructure you have to put the transmitters out there
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.140]   they won't put the transmitters out there unless they think they have
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.900]   an economic incentive to do so there'll be enough people who buy it
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:26.500]   and there's the issue of getting the back haul to match that that's hard drive
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.540]   speed yeah and so it's it's the same promises as
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:33.220]   made before but unless the economics are there it's not going to get into the
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.260]   rural areas but it does solve the last mile problem
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:39.220]   you know it does solve that problem of actually having your own a wire to
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:42.340]   your house which in theory will else you should
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:46.500]   solve that too and it did not and ymax was i remember how excited we were about
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:51.220]   my max suddenly this is going to wire the rural areas now ymax did have one
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:56.180]   advantage it worked over long distances i don't know whether micro millimeter
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.580]   will i suspect it won't i think that's going to be a problem with 5g but
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.020]   i don't know enough about it it's such a a soft
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:08.340]   definition it really is going to depend on how or what what gets implemented
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.420]   over the next couple of years let's take a break mike algin
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:15.860]   what are you drinking tonight anything uh delicious

[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.500]   because i know i like to mix up the generations
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.620]   no we that i remember one time when jerry purnell was on with me and i
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.780]   can't remember who else but what again it was like war act it's probably
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.660]   yeah the average age was like 90 or something i miss i have to say i very
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.780]   sad jerry passed away i really miss jerry he was he was
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:01.060]   quite the character we didn't always agree but he was quite
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:05.620]   i was such a fan of his science fiction the first time i was on with him
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:10.420]   it was like i'm on with i'm on with it i know i couldn't i can't talk
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.500]   he found the other jay i have to see if i i i so
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:20.980]   jerry purnell was playing was it the simpson's game or we rule i think it
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.180]   might have been we rule one of those farming games and i was playing we were
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.580]   playing together and in this game the mechanics of the game
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:33.860]   he gave me a book and it's safe on my screen jerry purnell just gave you a
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.940]   book and i snapped that when i saved that
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.100]   that's my claim to fame i played a game with jerry purnell our show today brought
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.740]   to you by quick and loans the folks who have really swept the nation

[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:39.940]   triangulation i have the distinct honor of welcoming a true geek someone who
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:44.500]   you've probably seen if you've run in the sci-fi and fantasy circles mr
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.980]   david hulip i think before i actually realized you could
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.820]   be an actor i wanted to be a time lord the amount of time i spent
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.180]   trying to build a sonic screwdriver is embarrassing
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.620]   you know because it just seems so logical to me
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:02.180]   all about android if i was on a galaxy s7 i'd even have problems
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.220]   justifying the purchase price like because the camera on something like the
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:09.860]   s7 was was just fantastic so in that sort of respect there's no real reason
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:13.220]   to go for it and there are certainly people there that are still rocking in a
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:19.220]   galaxy s4 and a galaxy s5 to those people i say the s9 is definitely worth it
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:23.140]   security now all of the evidence suggests
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:28.500]   that celebrate may now be able to unlock from

[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:40.340]   they're listening and Jason we've got leo's Tesla in front of us
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.540]   return into giants that's what really happened
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:49.060]   okay so this is oh i don't even want to know what they did to that
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.900]   did they mess with that i know how oh yeah yeah yeah
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:58.340]   let's talk about this story this is uh comes from Forbes but i think it's
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.060]   reported elsewhere as well celebrate which is the
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.660]   israeli company that's widely believed to be the company that broke the
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:09.140]   San Bernardino iPhone the one the feds begged apple to unlock and then said
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:13.860]   oh never mind i think we got this they have announced it's probably good
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:18.980]   marketing that they can even get into the iPhone 10 any model of iPhone up to
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:27.540]   ios 11.2.6 so yes this is actually no this comes from this
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:31.940]   exclusive to Forbes this is something that they've
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.780]   discovered recently generally these require
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.460]   vulnerabilities in the ios operating system and
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:43.300]   that's something of a concern and these companies are holding on to these
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.460]   exploits they're not telling consumers because
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:49.060]   then they can sell their services to law enforcement not just in this country
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:54.900]   but all over the world um and so we don't get the security update
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:01.140]   and they get to spy on us and we don't know who else is spying on us
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:08.340]   we if it's possible to uh crack these iPhones then is the NSA doing it is
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:12.260]   are the russians the Chinese the north koreans etc doing it are the nefarious
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.700]   criminal hackers doing it there's no way to know until
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:21.140]   much much later when we find out after it's long too late but um
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:24.180]   the question is is whether you know this is something that's you know
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.940]   sometimes there's there's a theoretical possibility of being able to exploit
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.260]   something and then there's something that's genuinely
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.660]   exploitable in some sort of practical way so uh it's early days on this
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.340]   particular one but we'll see if uh you know we'll see what Steve says about
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:42.180]   this and and if this requires physical access to the phone or that's
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.420]   something you can do remotely because that they they are
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:47.060]   they're the huge difference when they actually have to have your phone
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:51.140]   here's uh here's what celebrate told Forbes quote with its service offering
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:55.860]   celebrate can retrieve without needing to root or jailbreak the device the
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:59.940]   full file system to recover downloaded emails third-party
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:03.620]   application data geo location data and system logs
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:07.060]   agencies can provide the device already unlocked
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:11.300]   furnish the known pass cord or code or use celebrates advanced unlocking
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:15.540]   services to unlock the device so they do need physical access you say
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.940]   need physical access once the device is unlocked and or
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:21.860]   extracted is returned to the originating agency any extracted data is also
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.180]   sent to the agency oh oh here's the good news in encrypted form to ensure
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.740]   privacy
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:34.260]   fantastic well thank goodness uh the course you're not telling anybody how
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.700]   they do it and that's that's my big problem with this is that there is now
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.500]   a strong i mean they have million dollar contracts
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.700]   you know i guess apple off the hook i mean in a way
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.820]   it may be what may who knows you know for all we know apples telling them
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:50.500]   hey by the way yeah i'm back
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.780]   okay i'm just it just makes me mad that's all
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:57.060]   it just makes me mad you know i had a call this is
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.980]   some maybe you guys want to address i'd a call today from a young woman who had a
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:04.980]   gaming machine and it was an older machine that she'd built
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:08.660]   with an asus mother boy that was a few years old and it and it had not been
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:13.300]   patched for inspector and melt down and she said i can't get a mother board
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:18.660]   update from asus so it won't be patched so i'm not using it
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:24.820]   and i said oh my goodness use it right i don't have we oversold some of these
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.420]   security flaws yeah you know it's funny because i have a
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:32.100]   i have a new machine which has a bios update and i'm not
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.180]   applying the bios update for fear that it might patch specter
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.740]   because i'm a little nervous about what that's going to do to my system
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:43.540]   performance down yeah you know the bug so i i actually think that in some cases
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:46.420]   the cure is worse than the disease i mean yes there is a risk
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:51.220]   but with all the risks that are out there i'm not convinced that the specter risk
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.300]   is is as ominous as some people fear it is and i'm
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.460]   actually more worried about i'm machine not working properly if i apply the patch
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.860]   well and there are fixes at the operating system and
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.220]   you ended the browser level that's what i told her she does that's exactly
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:08.900]   what i told her yeah so she's missing one part of the overall patch
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.740]   the risk is low i told her just do what you we've always told you to do keep
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:16.500]   your system up to date don't download software from strangers don't run
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.060]   programs you didn't specifically go out to get
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:22.900]   and and my new advice which i am really pushing is
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:29.620]   install as few programs as you can in general on any device
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.700]   we all do this i have hundreds of apps on my phone most of which i will never
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:38.260]   use everything you put on your computer whether it's a phone a tablet or
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:42.740]   a desktop opens potentially opens exploits opens holes
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:47.060]   affects reliability it doesn't just waste space it could be a security flaw
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:51.220]   don't install it and if it's a molding it also affects the battery operation or
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:54.740]   could yeah and location information i think there's a lot of companies i'm
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:58.020]   starting to see this i believe there are a lot of companies out there who are
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:02.100]   actually pushing dopey i-phone and other and android
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:06.420]   applications just to get on your phone because there's so much value in the
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:09.140]   data they glean from just sitting on your phone
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.260]   that they they just desperate to get on your phone
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:15.940]   right yeah by the same token i think back to your original
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:22.740]   question there's there's a huge mismatch mismatch between the threat of certain
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.700]   uh things that could happen and the you know the the sort of the energy
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.780]   cost per minute so you go to a lot of websites
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:34.020]   and they they insist on this ridiculous password and the thing that they're
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.780]   protecting is nothing it's worthless right it's it's there's no data there's
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.380]   no nothing it's like you know and and so
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.020]   it's very important to realize that security
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:47.380]   threats will be with us forever and they'll always
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:51.700]   the but but you have to remember what is the threat what what could happen
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:56.580]   and if the worst thing that could happen is that somebody reads your
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.780]   subscription to the wall street journal then you don't need
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:04.820]   fort knock security to secure that that account right and my and my wall street
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.940]   journal password is a lot less secure than my banking password
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.380]   for that reason i mean and and the other thing is you know we and this is an
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:14.580]   issue pardon me this is an issue in the internet safety field also is
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.460]   understanding the difference between prevalence and severity
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:21.060]   sometimes these very very severe threats whether you're talking about you know
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:25.620]   kids being abducted or machines being taken over and manipulated
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.860]   are are horrible but statistically unlikely to happen
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.500]   so often we worry about the wrong threats
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.380]   and so it's really important to kind of think through before you take any
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.740]   extraordinary effort to protect yourself
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:41.780]   a what is the what is the likelihood of it happening to you
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:44.180]   and to what are the consequences of it happening
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:48.260]   and often the things that are are the most severe are the least likely
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:51.540]   but the things that are less severe but still extremely annoying
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:56.420]   are most likely so yes our consumers are normal people
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:00.740]   equipped to judge the risks i mean i think that the burden is on
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:06.100]   us on experts exactly to be yeah you know there's so much temptation to
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:11.540]   oversell the threat again link bait uh yeah that
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.900]   really i think it's incumbent on tech
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:18.020]   journalists who have the knowledge to be
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:21.060]   to share that information and say what the risks are
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:24.100]   right i know i'm guilty of this i mean this poor one was terrified probably
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.420]   because i'd been talking for weeks about specter meltdown and for security
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.860]   companies not to oversell the danger because obviously i can see why it
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.260]   meets their marketing thing but this is a problem
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.620]   and i this isn't recent but there was a time when mackerel would
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:41.060]   everything was like incredibly the world's falling apart if you don't
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:43.460]   install our software you know you're going to die in
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.420]   matter of minutes and and it got to the point where i stopped
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.300]   recommending their software their software's actually pretty good
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:53.380]   but their marketing was so fear-mongering that i thought they were doing more
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:55.860]   harm than good i they've gotten better since intel
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:58.900]   bought them so the yeah you have to have a seat
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:01.860]   yeah but you're right you're absolutely right Larry you have to have a sense of
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:06.180]   of uh probability that that's why i always fly with a bomb
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.860]   because the chance of the two bombs on a plane are infinitesimal okay he's
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:14.180]   making that up to fly you're on the you're on the watch list more
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:17.780]   by the way uh intel sold mackephy last year didn't they
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:22.420]   they sold it they spun it out and uh it was intel security they've rebranded it
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.780]   because the mackephy brand is such a strong brand
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.500]   especially the madam filth yeah why they renamed it i guess because it's not
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.940]   intel anymore they renamed it mackephy wow
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:37.940]   um real quickly actually let's take a break and then i i want to talk about
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.540]   amazon because there's a lot of amazon in the news
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:46.020]   including a big purchase and the fact that
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:53.300]   amazon paid zero taxes last year zero us income taxes
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:58.180]   did they make any money i think they did our show today brought to you by
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:03.700]   my mattress i tell you the more i uh the learn about health
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:09.700]   the more i realize that how you sleep is maybe one of the most important things
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:13.780]   for your health it's not just about whether you feel rested in the morning
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:19.220]   literally affects illness everything and having a comfortable mattress that
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.580]   sleeps cool that helps you get a good night's sleep is
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:28.100]   so important i sleep on a casper casper is an online retailer premium mattress
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:33.300]   services for a fraction of the cost they revolutionize i think this is safe to say
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.780]   they completely transformed the mattress industry
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:40.020]   they saw a real problem in the mattress industry massive markups
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:43.940]   and middlemen mattress stores that weren't doing people any good and they
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:48.420]   said you know if we sell direct if we if we eliminate the costs of resellers
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.220]   and showrooms and we sell direct to customers none of them can we get the
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:54.580]   cost but we can give customers a better experience
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.020]   so what they did is they made a great mattress they sell it directly to you and
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.940]   you by the way free shipping and free returns if you don't like it
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:05.540]   in the u_s and in canada and in the u_k_
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:08.500]   you sleep on this mattress and and they give you a hundred
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:13.860]   nights you get a hundred nights so you can try it you can see really if this
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.900]   mattress works for you and if at any time in that first hundred nights you don't
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.860]   like it you call them they come and get it
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.900]   and they refund you every penny so there's absolutely no risk
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:26.340]   this is a better way this is the revolution there are a lot of copy
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:30.500]   cats but caspers the original the original Casper mattress combines
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:34.100]   multiple supportive memory phones for a sleep surface
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:37.060]   go go look at the website with just the right sink
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.980]   just the right bounce it's breathable design
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:44.180]   means you sleep cool and even in the winter that's important you know you
[01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:46.740]   got the heat on and everything you don't want to be
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:50.820]   hot in bed you want to sleep cool and they don't say this in their ad copy but
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.820]   i'm gonna say this i've had mattresses i've had to air out for weeks
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.220]   they just smelled funny like the factory the Casper mattress it came out of the
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.780]   box and it's a surprisingly small box goes
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.860]   opens up it's it's it i didn't have to air it out all
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:09.220]   smell fabulous it's comfortable
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:14.180]   Casper is amazing the highest environmental production standards they're
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.660]   made in the u_s_a_ and you can get a Casper mattress right now

[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:13.620]   amazon earned billions in 2017 paid no u_s_ taxes
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:17.620]   according to c_n_n_ money not only is jeff baz was the richest
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:22.420]   person of all time but he made five billion in twenty says his company made
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:26.500]   five billion in 2017 no taxes not illegal
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.780]   not illegal this is just more of that
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.260]   s you know the dot all truck would say smart
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:34.580]   smart yes just smart
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.780]   right uh... they are actually paid taxes in previous years but it
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.500]   or what's your tax rate my tax rate is close to forty
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:45.300]   maybe fifty percent they they paid at eleven point four percent
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.740]   even though they have profits of eight point two billion
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.860]   anyway i don't want to set up uh... i don't want to set people up for jealousy
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.140]   but it's but there's amazing what you can do with money like that like for
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.140]   instance by ring
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.540]   and that's what they did this week
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:03.060]   we don't know exactly how much initially we thought it was a billion dollars now
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.500]   and i'm seeing
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:09.700]   from recode uh numbers closer to one point two to one point four
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.700]   uh billion dollars uh now ring is a sponsor we should mention we do ring
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:17.780]   ads all the time i take some responsibility for ring success
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.940]   i will get zero of this money but i'm happy for jamie and his team because
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:24.340]   that's uh that's a that's really nice
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:26.100]   here's the question
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.380]   why
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.220]   amazon key
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.420]   well but they already have key right they tried remember they tried to buy
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.700]   august
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:37.140]   that fell through effect august was pretty pissed off they feel like august that
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.180]   amazon found out how everything worked and said okay well nevermind
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:43.220]   and they built the shortly thereafter they built the key system which allows
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:45.300]   an amazon delivery person
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:49.140]   this expands on that into your house there's a camera there's a lock they
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.660]   can open the lock the camera watches them while they put the package in the
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.700]   door and they leave is that available in houston have you tried it
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:00.660]   yes it is available i i have not tried it uh i know of somebody who has it
[01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:05.380]   and they love it we have a real problem in houston has in a lot of other places
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:09.860]   with uh people stealing packages houston i believe houston is the place i think
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:14.100]   it is where the guy invented the box where you pick it up in a shotgun shell
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:18.980]   goes off in the box and and scares the what here's the first yes
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:23.220]   all in texas my friend in florida and some states
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:28.340]   but um but that is a uh it's such an issue here that the guy
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.980]   loves it you know he doesn't mind at all
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:34.820]   and uh i just could not do that there's just no way i would allow that and
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:37.540]   what we couldn't do that god would bite the guy so yeah
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.740]   i would be a problem well then my other problem is that it's the
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.380]   amazon logistics which i don't know what it's like in houston but in amazon
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.660]   logistics in it's awesome here is some person that you
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:51.220]   not in a uniform in a normal car because they kind of do it like uber
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:54.820]   where they just they let the list deliveries that they have and somebody
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:59.380]   says okay i'll do those and so to me that's like somebody like just somebody
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:03.540]   off the street coming in my house yeah now i don't have the problem with
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.580]   packages getting stolen because i have a ring video doorbell
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:10.660]   so so maybe maybe that's the i don't know um
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.340]   so is that why they bought it they want to replace key with ring
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:18.340]   or the ring expand those services or have i think it ties in it's i think it
[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:22.180]   tivin with the whole ecosystem for both you know i mean we look at amazon
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:26.660]   google and apple are all competing to to own your home and have as many
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:31.140]   devices in your home as possible and i think it tithen with the echo
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:34.340]   and i'm sure that they will continue to find ways to integrate i suspect they're
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:38.980]   already integrated to some extent but it's amazon really having a
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:43.860]   really uh a robust offering of home devices and i think things are going to
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.820]   have more of them just ring do anything other than
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:52.020]   a doorbell they've door basically it's a doorbell
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:55.300]   for the front door and then they attach the doorbell to lights it has security
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:57.780]   lights uh kind of the same thing but they did
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:01.620]   remember this they were going to launch last christmas a security home
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:07.300]   security system and adt sued them and i think that lawsuits over in fact
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.380]   my understanding is shortly before amazon bought them
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:15.380]   ring settled for a larger amount than they were agreed you know they suddenly
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.780]   said uh okay here's 25 million and the adt suit went away so they have
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:22.660]   now on their page they are selling their home security system are they
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.740]   currently and integrated to elect said anyway yes totally yes what i
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:30.420]   figured they would be yeah so but everything that actually everything
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:34.180]   is everything is that doesn't give them an exclusive by any means no no
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:38.500]   no but it means it's a good theory yeah um so amazon is famous for a number
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.900]   of things and one of them is having a kind of
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:46.260]   quasi or wellian employee situation where they watch their employees
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:50.420]   oh wow in a microcosmic way they everyone's clocked in they monitor their
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:55.780]   location they and and they're about to launch inevitably into this world
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:59.620]   where amazon is directly amazon employees will be doing the lion's
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:03.700]   share of deliveries to to the front door yes and this is a way for them to
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:08.020]   monitor their own employees and their performance and their behavior
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:11.780]   interesting wow but you have so many of those
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:14.980]   rings installed not everybody's going to put those
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:19.460]   in there that's that makes sense in that sense the privacy so if if i have a
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:22.100]   ring in my house did amazon have the right
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:25.860]   to look at the video okay that might ring this is something
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:30.340]   this is something that i've been uh it's kind of pursuing uh recently i've
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:33.460]   asked amazon several times pointed questions about
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.340]   exactly what they do in terms of do they listen when
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:40.180]   they're not listening to the keywords and are they doing are they doing
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:43.220]   experiments where they have uh Alexa doing things that people don't
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.260]   necessarily expect and whenever i ask those questions they
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:49.300]   they just stop interacting with me they don't answer them
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.580]   and that doesn't mean that they're doing those things it doesn't mean
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:56.420]   anything nefarious but it does mean that they have not answered those questions
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:00.740]   yet so i've i've read their their terms of service there's nothing in the terms
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:04.180]   of service that i can find that prohibits them from
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.940]   monitoring video feeds listening in through amazon doing any of these
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:11.380]   things and i think it's an underexplored area we have this black box that we're
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.620]   putting in every house and i'm not a you know a conspiracy theory
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:20.100]   minded person or suspicious of tech companies as a rule
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:23.140]   but in this case i'm a little concerned about amazon because they're
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:26.660]   they're so they hold it so close to the vest they don't tell us exactly what
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:29.140]   they're doing they have a history of for example with the
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.900]   fire phone of when you when you take a picture of something they're also
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:36.660]   transmitting the audio back to amazon and doing god knows what with it
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:40.500]   so that there's a there's a i don't think they've earned our trust yet they're
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:44.740]   not transparent enough yet and i think that uh it behooves those of us in
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:48.260]   the media to keep pushing them to find out exactly what their intentions are
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:52.900]   what they do what they don't do uh and it's especially urgent now that they
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:56.180]   have all these ring video doorbells
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:59.940]   you know it's funny because my um my echo will sometimes talk to me even though
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:03.140]   i don't say the word oh i have it's all the time it's because it's like you're
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:06.740]   watching tv right or it's right or here's something else it thinks you're saying
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:10.340]   the word i'm going to go home though all of these apologize for saying that
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.940]   word on on your show because i'm sure that millions of echoes
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:18.100]   just got activated when i said it though you know it's only a problem if you're
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:23.220]   listening to the show on your echo because then it stops the show
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:26.740]   and start and says what do you want and so that's a little annoying but other
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:30.340]   than that i you know these things happen we you know we actually bloop it out of
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.860]   the downloaded version so it's only people watching live that get bit by
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:37.060]   that but uh is that that's something we decided to start doing
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:39.460]   bloop it out and here's here's a weird thing that may
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:44.900]   i call it the a word some of your listeners but actually travel with both my what
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:49.460]   echo and also my ring video doorbell i travel with both of these two of the
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:53.460]   most important things that i travel with yeah everywhere we go we plug in the
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:57.700]   the echo we have music we have information whether a portal so you're not so
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:02.020]   worried about the privacy implications that you don't use it
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:03.620]   no
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.580]   i don't know about the doorbell are you renting a place or are you not
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:09.220]   a hotel where are you that you can hook up a doorbell
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:13.620]   i use mounting putty and i put it outside the door i connected a wi-fi
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:17.220]   and everywhere i got it's it's got a one-year battery in it uh some of
[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:20.020]   yeah and so you don't have to worry about powering it you could just find out
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.460]   where he's staying and go steal of it yeah
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:28.180]   good job so i was notting putty yeah that's right you have to pull hard because
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:31.140]   that's really interesting mike i didn't i didn't i i know you thought it was a
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:34.980]   good product for airbnb uh
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:38.820]   breaders everyone involved yeah in renting airbnb should be using this
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:42.420]   it's just a fantastic so the the biggest thing so
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.300]   we've we've stayed a lot of countries that are not necessarily safe and we
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.820]   and when you're in airbnb everyone in the neighborhood knows you're a foreigner
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:52.820]   with expensive equipment and all this stuff and so it's kind of a little bit
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:57.300]   you get kind of nervous and with a ring video doorbell you come back to the
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:00.180]   house before you go in you check to see if anyone has
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:03.460]   gone in right and you can see nobody's gone in you walk in with
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:07.620]   college that's really nice that's a great reason to do that i don't have a ring
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:11.220]   ring but i have a vivid system and so if somebody comes to my door
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:14.420]   i'll get a notice saying somebody that you're door but by the time i get to
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:17.380]   look at them they're usually gone because of the delay or do you do you
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:21.060]   find that you actually can often see the person in real time and interact with
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:26.420]   them before they actually leave absolutely yeah it's instantaneous almost
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:29.620]   maybe you might have no worse late and there's about 10 seconds five to 10
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:32.340]   seconds latency in a on in worst case but that's an
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:35.380]   reason usually to catch the people wait at the door but they ring the doorbell
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:38.100]   they wait 10 seconds yeah no mind my latency i think
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:40.740]   of about 30 seconds so that's that's good to know yeah
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:44.180]   now they've done it right and i i mean that's why amazon bottom but
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:50.660]   you know if amazon doesn't need to push the envelope they're doing
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:54.820]   great they don't have to take chances with people's privacy
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:59.060]   they don't even have to make acquisitions of cameras if that makes people nervous
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:03.940]   what now i'm not a ceo and i never will be so i don't maybe understand business
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:10.340]   but why would jeff bazos take chances like that why i mean if if well why
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:12.820]   why did their whole business model is based on
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:17.460]   algorithmically uh determine sort of behavioral models so they
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:21.540]   if you think about what they track and what they do on the amazon website
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:24.820]   and even when you go beyond the website whether they go where you
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.220]   they figure out where you're going what you're doing with how long the mouse
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:29.300]   hovers over this is that mean you're interested
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.900]   they're they're they're upset and look at their grocery store amazon go
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.580]   this is not about a convenient grocery store this is about a physical brick
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:38.660]   and mortar grocery store that has the kind of
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:43.380]   behavioral data that their website has and so they're obsessed with
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:47.700]   understanding what people do and a camera is by far
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:51.780]   the most valuable sensor for figuring out what's happening
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:54.420]   in general with human behavior they can see
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:58.180]   who's coming who's going what time how long you know all this stuff is
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:01.940]   happening and so so it's all they're like google
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:05.780]   it's it's all about the data it's about big data and how you can
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:10.180]   plug in artificial intelligence to get in to get information that enables you
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:12.420]   to be more competitive in everything you do
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:15.140]   ten years from now i'm going to take issue that your growth three bags if you
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:18.020]   walk in the house and figure out where you're buying your growth or even
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:21.940]   make sure that they're underbidding you know wow that's interesting
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.700]   ten years from now we're going to look back and regret that we didn't
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:30.740]   uh... work more proactive in in in in fighting the growth of amazon and google
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:32.740]   and facebook
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.260]   are we
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.980]   do you think i don't know
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:41.460]   i don't think so i think i think things change and happen so quickly
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.180]   that google and facebook and amazon in ten years may not be what they are now
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:49.140]   and there may be somebody else we have to worry about fighting
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:52.660]   okay it just funny that's all the time i remember
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:55.940]   during the anti-trust case against microsoft and i i was actually right
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:58.420]   kind of sympathize with the justice department
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:01.540]   but bill gates made a statement in front of the senate he said you know
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:05.380]   it could very well be that some company comes along and they wind up
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.580]   taking a big part of our business and of course he didn't at the time know that
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.260]   google was about to eat his lunch when it came to the internet
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:15.860]   and and and you know it turned out to be true not not that microsoft failed of the
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:19.380]   company it's doing fine but certainly in the area that we were all worried
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.660]   about in the in the late nineties which was their internet explorer and what
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:26.100]   they were going to online it turned out that they didn't dominate this other
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:30.020]   company came around and dominated and it may be unfortunate that our legal
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:32.500]   system wasn't able to do what it tried to do
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:36.340]   because it turns out that market forces it were even better well but there was
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:40.180]   an article last Sunday the times charles dewigg uh... uh... writing about
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:40.980]   google
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:44.820]   said google wouldn't exist if if the d_o_j_ hadn't gone out after microsoft not
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:46.500]   so much because microsoft shut
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.300]   you know google's d_o_j_ shut microsoft down but just that
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:53.140]   microsoft got cautious they start looking over their shoulders and that was
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:56.020]   enough to open the door for google otherwise
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:31:00.260]   microsoft might have persisted with explorer and being a google had better
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:03.540]   products i mean they had the one in the marketplace i think they had a great
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:07.220]   early search engine you know way back and i don't think google's getting
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:10.260]   cautious because of all of the antitrust stuff in europe and so on
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:14.180]   sure can throw the wind being uh... taken out of their sales
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:17.220]   there there seemed less aggressive much uh...
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:21.300]   more cautious about getting into things that involve privacy and so on so i
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:24.980]   think the same thing is happening to them you i guess you reach a certain size
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.500]   uh... and you just can't be as scrappy and aggressive as you were when you were
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.540]   a start up
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:33.940]   you know the g_d_p_r_ which is this a global data privacy thing out of europe
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:37.060]   uh... general privacy of europe is kicking and i think in may
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.300]   and that's going to have a huge impact on all these companies i don't know if
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.020]   you've done a show about that you've talked a lot about it absolutely
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:45.460]   and it's a huge issue you know it's it's there's
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:48.740]   uh... a real division among uh...
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:52.740]   uh... are panelists about whether this is going to be a disaster for the
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:57.060]   internet or something much needed for the internet and i'm
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:00.980]   i'm go back and forth but i'm starting to kind of head over on the
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:06.340]   we do need some protections and since the u_s_ seems to not want to do this
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:09.460]   it's it's good at least that europe's paying attention to this i'm not sure
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:13.060]   i agree with all of the legal action uh... no you got right you're up to the
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.540]   know we get it right but they're well-intentioned and
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.980]   and at least they are they are somebody's got a pay attention to this
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:19.540]   yes
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.940]   the f_t_c_ sure as heck isn't
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:25.300]   and the f_c_ of course and then there's always the argument well
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:28.260]   and i think quite you were kind of making this this stuff changes so fast
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.860]   innovation will win
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:34.260]   you don't have to worry technology that the business cycle is so rapid that
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.420]   you just just let it happen
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:40.900]   no just look at our ridiculous it is now that to think back and and think that
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.100]   everybody was worried about internet explorer
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:46.020]   yeah you know
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:49.780]   yeah on the other hand a lot of damage could be done very quickly so i mean
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:52.820]   you could argue that we were at the president of the states don't worry for
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:56.180]   seven years from now it'll be gone but you know what happens during those four
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:33:00.100]   seven years so i i think it's worth taking a look at it i mean actually i've
[01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:01.540]   been kind of one of the
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.940]   biggest uh opponents of of of regulation and very concerned about the danger
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:08.020]   of regulation but i'm actually beginning
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:10.820]   to think that we are entering a period where the government has to be smart
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.700]   about it
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:14.580]   unfortunately it won't and that's the last group i would
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:17.780]   the last two words i would not combine
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:21.220]   government and government especially when it comes to technology that's the
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.500]   problem and yet i'm not any government because there's no one else going to do
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.220]   it
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:30.740]   uh no one's going to self-regulate so uh i i think that it's just government
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:33.700]   in in terms of reflecting the needs of society
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:38.260]   is the only choice but we got a little bit more chat room i'm condemning us yet
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:41.380]   oh you know but that's the debate and we have this debate all the time and i
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:43.780]   am not even sure which way to go
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:47.940]   remember the late john perry barlow telling me uh uh when the net neutrality
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:52.820]   issue uh was uh hot and heavy whether trying to convince
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:56.660]   tom weiler at the fcc to invoke title two regulation he said
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:59.780]   even at the eff at the board meetings we we've
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:03.540]   tussle with this on the one hand we hate the idea of government intervention
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:07.140]   in the internet on the other hand we know the internet needs protection and
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:10.260]   and there doesn't seem to be a straightforward easy answer
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:13.860]   right actually the supreme court right now is uh is
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.860]   weighing uh a microsoft dispute with the department of justice
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:21.060]   this has more to do with where your data is
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:25.060]   stored fascinating yeah it is a fascinating story
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:30.660]   the um the the the argument is over data stored in ireland
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:35.060]   right now stored on microsoft servers in dublin it's a drug trafficking case an
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:38.820]   irish uh criminal suspect using
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:43.140]   microsoft i guess i presume hot mailer outlook to store his mail
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:48.340]   uh the d_o_j_ wanted it lower court said well you can't have it it's in ireland
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:52.340]   um but now it's up the supreme court the d_o_j_ has brought it all the way to
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:56.420]   the supreme court and while it's very hard to read what the
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:00.020]   supreme court's going to do based on oral arguments of chappen tuesday
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:03.380]   uh it does seem that at least
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:07.300]   a few of the judges are very sympathetic to the department of justice's
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:12.900]   stance which would have an interesting impact on the u_s_ business because
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:18.100]   you know data internet is not national doesn't respect board right but the
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:21.300]   problem the irish authority about something to say about it even if the
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:25.300]   department of justice thinks it's okay to dip into a server house in ireland
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.700]   ireland had a different perspective on this so
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:31.860]   and and and the other problem is i mean a lot of our laws there are a lot of our
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:35.380]   privacy laws are still based on the notion of physicality
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:39.220]   right and and this notion uh you know they're based on filing cabinets right
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:42.020]   that you can go in and what you can do with a filing cabinet
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.740]   but when you're talking about cloud storage it's a whole different animal
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:49.140]   which gets into the uh you know a lot of the privacy laws
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:53.380]   and there's a corollary to this story with uh the case of apple
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:58.980]   starting to store chinese customer in china along with the encryption keys
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:03.540]   to access their data in china and that's uh you know
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:08.180]   the other thing is is that while microsoft says that the data is stored in uh in
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:11.780]   ireland in a lot of cases particularly with cloud computing
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.820]   and certainly the case of of googles approach to it
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:19.060]   the data is everywhere there may be a bit of it in ireland there may be a bit
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:23.140]   of it in in now the u_s_ there may be a bit of it in brazil
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:27.140]   and so you know the data made live globally as opposed to in one particular
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:31.380]   location right yeah and ultimately it's not about
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:34.580]   the location it's about the it's about the
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:39.780]   uh segregating the data for people who are citizens of a specific country and
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:43.940]   then uh governments uh trying to determine what can be done with that
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:46.020]   data it really doesn't matter where the data
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:48.740]   is stored that's kind of a little bit of a misdirection
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:53.140]   it's about control over what happens with people's data and trying to get
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:56.340]   bring those under federal under you know national laws
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:59.380]   but but i i don't i don't know they call all the details on this government
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:03.540]   thing but obviously u_s_ persons are involved in this case so it's not purely
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.980]   yeah you know the victim somebody here is in the united states so it's not
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:11.300]   purely like we're trying to break into some internal irish issue here
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.980]   uh the u_s_ the government does have an interest in this data the question is
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:17.540]   whether they have a legal right to access it
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:21.380]   has ireland said anything specifically about this case
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:24.900]   i believe they have have have they now i believe they said you got to get a
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:27.620]   warrant or whatever the irish equivalent of a warrant is
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:31.700]   but microsoft controls it i mean and microsoft's a u_s_ country
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:34.660]   so company a company yeah country that was a
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:37.220]   Freudian slip they used to be a country yeah but you
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:40.980]   the warrant you could serve on microsoft it would be valid in seattle
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.420]   isn't valid in in dublin unless the irish authorities
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:47.140]   say it is valid well i'm sure they'll have something to say about it
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:50.900]   uh yeah it's it's a challenge and that's
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.220]   it is part of the problem is that internet data
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.740]   doesn't respect national borders let's take a
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:38:00.820]   mic i'm not sure necessarily that it's a that it's a distraction i think
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:04.500]   uh if you were going to have a uh a good lawyer arguing
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:08.740]   uh that case um i think that that would be something that they would definitely
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:12.500]   uh bring up if they wanted to keep google i mean if they wanted to keep the
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:16.340]   google data uh private our show today brought to you by

[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:38.580]   github this week survived and this worries me a lot the biggest
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:43.220]   d-doss attack ever recorded get ready for this
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:48.980]   1.3 terabits per second
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:52.660]   now it didn't last very long because d-doss
[01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:55.780]   protection of course github had d-doss protection
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:58.980]   uh alchemized prolexic service they took over
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:03.460]   after eight minutes the attack uh backed down but
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:07.940]   the fact that an attacker could launch a 1.35 terabit attack
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:11.060]   and it was almost certainly an amplification attack which means
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:14.420]   means that the attacker didn't have to have much bandwidth at all
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:20.580]   could have had a dsl dial up or modem but because they were taking advantage of
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:24.900]   about 100,000 memcache servers owned by businesses and other
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:28.340]   institutions that were just sitting online with no
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:32.180]   authentication simple thing to do the attacker just
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:34.980]   sends them a special command packet the server replies
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:40.660]   with a much larger reply and boom uh one point what was it three two terabytes
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:45.140]   that's just crazy this uh the previous largest
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:49.620]   uh d-doss attack you remember from the end of uh 2016 when almost the brought
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:55.620]   down the internet when the uh dine dns uh service was brought down
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:59.940]   um but this was even bigger look at this this is this is it this is
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:03.940]   this is the picture this is the spike whoa
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:10.900]   yow yow is uh real-time traffic but uh it's kind of interesting how the
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:13.780]   mitigations happening and how quickly it's happening now
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:16.900]   people are amazing yeah they prepared for this stuff you have to throw a lot of
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:20.900]   bandwidth do we assume this is a state-sponsored
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.700]   attack i mean that's what's interesting about amplification
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:28.020]   attacks like this it doesn't have to be it could be literally could be a
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:31.540]   script kitty uh because this memcache flaw is well
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:35.060]   known that's what's that's what's really see
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:39.300]   i don't want to oversell security problems but there is an issue
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:43.140]   when security problems it's not just your computer it's not just you're getting
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:48.180]   ransomware you're being used for these kinds of attacks then it's
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:52.020]   right there's a public health issue right no it's very it's very similar to
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:55.460]   why you want to give take a flu shot if i mean they work yes
[01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:57.860]   because it's not a matter just protecting yourself it's a matter
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:01.700]   protecting the herd and that's definitely true when it comes to uh
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:05.300]   to cyber security it's almost a patriotic thing for us all
[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:08.900]   yes protect our systems so we don't mess up other people's systems yeah
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:13.860]   yeah it's not about you it ain't not exclusively well it's partly about you
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:18.180]   partially about you it's you and everybody else i don't want to get the flu or
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:24.100]   spread the flu right right um wow this i mean there's not a
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:27.060]   whole lot to say about it except that it happened
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:30.660]   that it took advantage of you know unpatched memcache
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:35.940]   right servers and uh and that that capability really doesn't require a
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:39.060]   nation state doesn't require it i think the biggest i think the biggest
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:42.900]   part of the story that at least the one that i'm most impressed with is that
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:47.780]   is the fast recovery that's amazing that is truly amazing that's a complete
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:51.620]   shift and it just shows that people are now prepared and they're ready and
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:57.860]   there are services like akhama are are uh great friends um and former
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:01.940]   sponsors at now i can't remember the name john graham cummings
[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:06.980]   company uh hey man buy another ad we'll remember the name yeah if i only if
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:10.580]   they only bought some actually they're they are they are back on so i should
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:17.140]   remember the names uh uh to cloud flare course cloud flare how could i
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:20.100]   forget cloud flare you know what i want to forget the emoji
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:24.020]   movie now i know the oscars are coming up and we're going to wrap up because
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:26.100]   i know you all want to see the oscars but you're
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:30.260]   i don't think this is a spoiler to tell you that according to the razis
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:38.020]   the emoji movie was the worst film of 2018 winning four count them four
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:45.140]   razi awards and any movie that has patrick steward as talking poo
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:50.900]   oh the golden razbear you gotta give him credit for you
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:55.140]   and taking that i think he must you know british actors will take anything
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:58.900]   right but i think there's two involved i think he must have just said oh this

[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:39.860]   larry and uh in my particularly larry because you know we probably will never
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:43.220]   write another book together again but those are some great now how did you do
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:45.700]   you want to do another vista book together we could we could
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:51.460]   sell four copies vista memories that's right that would be a bill larry larry
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:54.900]   actually had started it and i you had like some health issues right and
[01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.340]   yeah i've finished the whole time here so you know the funny thing you wrote a book
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:01.060]   you were i was thinking about you just yesterday you wrote a book after my
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:05.060]   with a book community together about switching from uh windows to mac
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:06.980]   well this is what i wrote every one was about funny
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:09.220]   i want to write a book about switching from mac to windows
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.580]   maybe you there's a market there's a there's a there's a
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:16.100]   i think there will be yeah that's how you know we're old because we've all
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:21.540]   written computer books exactly yeah what a terrible idea
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:27.140]   maybe i won't write dead book well the problem dead trees is it takes so
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:32.500]   damn long to print them up that's right i think ed bot and and uh
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:36.340]   and paul's ron once still left me and paul's ron still writing them yeah
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:39.700]   david pog's still writing the whole pog yes yes
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:43.620]   yeah but they figured out i guess they must have a formula or they know i was
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:47.140]   offered dawson dummies and i turned it down because i didn't like that title
[01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:52.340]   it sold eight million how did you know larry i do i do i hear the dummies i
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:56.100]   thought you're demeaning your readers why would you say that exactly i turned
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:59.140]   down mac macarthy asked me to write i turned him down
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:02.740]   it sold eight million copies i wrote the little pc book instead which did okay
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:06.340]   which was a great book well it was enough to make a down payment on the house
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:08.820]   if i had brought in dawson dummies i could have bought several
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:14.580]   out of that back then but so so be it it's okay we all have stories like that
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:19.140]   larry yes right thank you all for being here we do twit normally we did a little
[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:22.420]   early this week but normally we do a three p m pacific six p m eastern time
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:28.260]   2300 utc on a sunday afternoon evening it's always a great way to cap your
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:33.380]   week and if i suspect some people watch live at twit.tv/live if you do that
[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:37.780]   join us in the chatroom at irc.twit.tv most people though and this has
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:42.500]   turned out and it was completely by accident back in 2005 when i launched
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:46.260]   the show turns out people like to download podcasts
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:49.300]   sunday night monday morning for their commute in on monday
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:53.140]   and i know that's how you'll listen so you'll find it at twit.tv like all our
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:58.580]   shows on demand audio and video if you have a tv in your car i guess
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:03.700]   or you're on one of them fancy uber metro train kind of a things
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:07.220]   you can watch us and you can subscribe in your favorite podcast that's probably
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:11.220]   the best way and don't forget we can also be heard on all of the voice
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:14.420]   activated devices there's different syntax for all of them
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:19.460]   but in general you just ask it to listen to this week in tech or any of our
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:22.180]   shows and you'll get the most recent episode and i think more and more that's
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:26.180]   how people are going to be listening it's just even the car going forward
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:30.260]   you know i have a the roav viva yeah i do too amazon echo on my car it's
[01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:34.740]   fantastic i love it i love it yeah and yeah you can ask for podcasts by
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:37.460]   name it's in fact it's i actually was going to cancel my
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:41.060]   satellite radio until they made me such a great deal to keep it i decided to
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:44.260]   keep it but they hit after until if they hadn't lower the price they would
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:48.740]   cancel they are the kings of hard sell i i i oh yes
[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:51.780]   oh yes you cannot cancel serious xm they just
[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:55.140]   harass you to death you know but it they'll get it down to a pretty good price if
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.300]   you if that's good i didn't know that yeah because i can
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:01.300]   need satellite radio you got it anymore you don't need that
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:04.180]   oh the only reason i had it with a user interface but now that i can use my
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:07.780]   voice that's not an issue your voice is the best user interface
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:11.700]   obviously yep thank you everybody for joining us we'll see you next time another
