[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.160]   It's time for Twit.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.600]   This week in tech, the show that covers the week's tech
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.480]   news, a great-- as usual, a great panel assembled.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.080]   I'm going to start with a guy who's not here.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.200]   He's actually in his sauna today.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.680]   Clayton Morris.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.800]   God, it's getting hot in here.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.880]   Foxandfriends.com.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.800]   It's so cold in upper Pennsylvania that he actually
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.560]   has to live in a sauna.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   I have a little water boy.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.080]   Can you put some more water on your full squeeze?
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.800]   Clayton, Fox and Friends, of course.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.000]   And you just launched what?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.080]   Grizzly Adams Productions, what is that?
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.640]   Grizzlyproductions.tv.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.200]   We had all of our shows for four years
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.680]   scattered across all these disparate lands.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.320]   And we finally, after months and months of working on it,
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.760]   we built it on the backs of Squarespace, by the way.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.960]   And fantastic shows.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.800]   Oh, that's nice to know.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.400]   Options.tv.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.360]   We have all of our shows now living under one roof.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.240]   And it's still in beta.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.480]   So hey, all of the listeners of Twit go there and rip us apart.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.640]   Tell us what we need to fix.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.880]   We're still working on it and tweaking things.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.320]   I didn't realize you had so many shows.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.400]   This is great.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.360]   A lot of parenting shows.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000]   And we just launched our new sports show.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600]   So if you're twice a week, if you're into sports,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.800]   this guy's like Rain Man.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.320]   He's like a walking encyclopedia.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   Paul Roberts.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.960]   Paul Roberts.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.480]   He's great.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.240]   So thanks for having me.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.280]   I always loved being on the show.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.920]   That's great.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.000]   And I know Natalie's doing the mommy beta, which is great.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.920]   Yeah, four moms get together and they
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.600]   cabbits and complain about what it's like to be new moms.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.560]   Aww.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.640]   I've never heard that before.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.880]   Daddy on the board.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.520]   Is that you?
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.280]   Daddy on the board.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.720]   Yeah, that's me and my pal Mike.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.760]   And that's where most of the complaining comes in.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.360]   So if you're a new dad, if you want to join the revolution,
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.920]   we get people all the time who say, just found your show.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.160]   I'm about to be a dad in three weeks.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.440]   And we trust me.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.320]   We tell it like it is.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.480]   We tell you what furniture not to build if the wife orders it.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.840]   Oh, the Ikea.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.360]   Oh, God.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.920]   Right, or some assembly required.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.440]   No.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.080]   That's a bunch of bunk.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.840]   We tell you what not to build.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.160]   If it comes with one of those little L-shaped hexagonal
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.480]   wrenches--
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.960]   No.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.320]   An Allen wrench, run away.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.840]   No.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.360]   What are you doing with the Ikea tools that always
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.240]   ship with the Ikea?
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.080]   That's it.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.360]   That's David Prager, by the way.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.520]   David Prager from Revision 3.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.560]   Sitting next to him, Louis Glamour from Seismic and Lo Web,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.720]   which is coming up in December.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.880]   We're excited to be part of that.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.480]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.360]   Tweet at Lo Web.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.560]   Tweet at Lo Web.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.480]   What do you call it?
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.880]   That's good.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   I like it.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.040]   I thought, "Twit in Paris."
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.400]   OK.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.240]   A "Twit in Paris."
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.720]   Yes, so you're going to have your own studio.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.080]   That'll be good.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.840]   I'm so excited.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   Yeah, that's going to be great.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.000]   And Alexia Totsis is also here from--
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.040]   OK, guys.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.960]   Are you still at TechCrunch?
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.400]   I'm still at TechCrunch.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.280]   OK, just checking, because--
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   You mean--
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.480]   You never know.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.560]   Wow.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.200]   We're not going to spend a lot of time talking about TechCrunch.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   Just helping out.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.880]   It's really boring.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.040]   I'm sure it's boring to everybody, except those of us
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.000]   in the tech industry, tech journalism industry,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.040]   who are fascinated, can't get enough of this.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.800]   But just from your point of view, how is things going?
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.600]   Are you comfortable?
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.080]   Are you-- is everything all right?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.720]   Well, I was on vacation for--
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.320]   Smart.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   Yeah, I know.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.400]   Might go on another one.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.920]   Smart.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.320]   I was on vacation for the beginning of this.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.280]   And so I came back really calm.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.760]   And I spent time with my 90-year-old grandmother.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.400]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.160]   In Greece.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.760]   In Greece.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.120]   So I have a different perspective,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.280]   because my mom asked me last week.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.760]   She's like, what's a blog?
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.280]   And I'm like, oh, it's like a newspaper, but it's online.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.080]   Should anyone publish anything they want?
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.560]   It's like, what?
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.720]   She doesn't really know what you do.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.240]   Oh, she doesn't know.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.360]   I was like, well, technically they can,
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.640]   but it's not that simple.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.760]   So I have a different perspective.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.800]   I really love tech news.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.120]   And I think that anything that makes tech news more
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.120]   entertaining and reaches a wider audience is a good thing.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.200]   TechCrunch is going through its stuff right now.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.040]   And we've definitely made it interesting for people
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.280]   to read about--
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.840]   No kidding.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.960]   Were there a lot of memos flying?
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.320]   I mean, you come back and there's
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.520]   like 100 memos and you're conflicting memos.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.200]   Paul Carson, don't listen to Eric Eric's thing.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.120]   Don't listen to Paul.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.080]   I mean, basically what you guys saw is what we saw.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.280]   It all took place on the blog.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.000]   And--
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.720]   There was no secrets.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   Yeah, there was no secrets.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.920]   And we didn't see very much internally we saw.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.680]   Or I didn't.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.720]   Maybe other people did.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.480]   But a lot of it--
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.200]   Well, TechCrunch has distributed too, Eric's in New York.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.920]   You're out here.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.560]   Everybody's all over the place, right?
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.360]   And we're pretty much independent.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.560]   It's a group of independent journalists
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.720]   trying to break news.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.880]   June at East, you said?
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.920]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.360]   I think she said June at East.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.120]   Actually, that was lazy of me.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.640]   A group of independent writers.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.160]   Bloggers.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.240]   I actually think the word "journalist"
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.320]   is just so raw with BS that I don't like using it.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.280]   So we're a group of independent writers
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.760]   who cover technology who have WordPress credentials
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.640]   and can publish onto the blog.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.320]   And we coordinate so we don't overlap on stories.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.760]   But for the most part, we're on our own,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   which is the great thing about TechCrunch.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.400]   And it has a great voice.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.480]   And I think that you were very--
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.200]   Loic, you were defending Mike.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.960]   Mike was an early investor in Seize-Mick,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.760]   we should point out.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.280]   Yeah, well, you know, of course, as many people,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.720]   there has been so many posts around TechCrunch.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.480]   And Mike, more about Mike probably
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.520]   than TechCrunch actually.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.280]   And there were like-- I think it was just too much.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.080]   So I had to put this blog post where I explained
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.760]   Mike was an early investor in Seize-Mick.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.320]   And actually, I wasn't complaining about that.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.840]   But what you get as an investor with Mike as an investor
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.880]   is generally a lot of trashing online.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.040]   He wasn't overly kind.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.240]   No, most of the posts were actually pretty negative.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.160]   And that's fine.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.880]   He didn't compare.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.720]   I was expecting those, basically.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.320]   But I was just saying that--
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.760]   I'm trying to say, which was difficult in that post--
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.800]   that I don't think he's BS.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.000]   I think you have to like him or hate him.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.240]   Or there is no in between, like he is.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.600]   And I think he's just one of the centers of technology
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.560]   and whatever he does, he will continue.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.880]   And you don't have to think about him as a journalist.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.280]   And people are saying he's BS.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.040]   And so it doesn't matter.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.920]   That's not the point.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.680]   The point is, do you like reading him
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.760]   and the controversy on the conversation or not?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.120]   But it matters.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.480]   And I always took him as-- when I talked to him,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.320]   I was saying, are you a friend?
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.240]   The investor of a blogger today.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.680]   And I'm thinking--
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.640]   And you never know.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.480]   And you never know.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.080]   You actually said it's always blogger first.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.360]   What happens to tech crunch now?
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   I think the background of the story
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.160]   is pretty important because if you look at what--
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.920]   who calls himself a blogger and who calls himself
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.480]   as a journalist, and then some of the environment
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.280]   that's been created by writers on tech crunch
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.640]   being personalities and people being interested
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.880]   and following a personality, obviously, I think,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.720]   Errington, the strongest personality at tech crunch,
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.000]   and part of his value is people being interested
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.960]   in what he thinks and what he wants to say.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.080]   And one of the things I've always said about Errington
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.280]   that I think is good is I've never seen him
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.200]   to lie about anything.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.560]   I've always seemed to be truthful.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.400]   But then the big contribution, the question was--
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.960]   I don't think that's the case about it.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.320]   Some of the traditional rules on what journalism is
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.000]   and what it means in being able to have a platform to promote
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.960]   the things that you want.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.280]   And one of the things that Michael says is,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.360]   I'm going to talk about what I want.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.160]   No one's going to stop me from talking about what I want.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.760]   And I think there's a lot of people that do respect that.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.800]   And there's arguments to be made around that,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.080]   especially when you start looking at investment funds
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.000]   and where people are putting money and what you can say
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.600]   about a company, not say about it, or decide to say
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.320]   something positive or negative or not at all.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.720]   Huge respect about being able to say what you really think.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.680]   And Mike Desvie's carded with the tech crunch
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.960]   where he gave his resignation.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.120]   And I think it's great.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.560]   We live in a world where everybody is so fakly nice.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.680]   Like they don't tell you what they really--
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.320]   He's not fakly nice.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.480]   No, that's what I mean.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.000]   At least you have--
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.600]   That's something of a truth, Fred.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   Great, you're that.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   Clayton, you asked a question.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:18.800]   Go ahead.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   You're going to have a hard time there
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.280]   in the maple sugar house.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.600]   Because, you know, just jumps around.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.760]   You're a friend's guy.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.520]   You're in the wood.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.960]   What happens to tech crunch now?
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.040]   I mean, this was all playing out.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.960]   It was interesting to read, obviously, all the back
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.240]   and forth online about this.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.120]   But Leo, I think to your point, even before the show started,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.160]   is this inside the beltway talk?
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.880]   And really, to do most people pay attention to this outside
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.800]   of the tech world, what's going on, the sort of back and forth.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.160]   And if you read this, and you read the back and forth,
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   and the way it was funny to look at how it was all laid out
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.720]   on tech me the other day, right?
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.640]   At the top, you have--
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.960]   It was hysterics comments below that.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.000]   Pauls, and the MG Sigglers.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.480]   And oh, my God.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.640]   It was all booger rubbing back.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.000]   But you know what's funny is, this happens in every office.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.520]   But this is--
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.920]   That doesn't happen in public, exactly.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.440]   I think you're right.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:06.640]   Right.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.080]   I mean, this is the same thing.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.640]   He said this.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.680]   He said that.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.560]   But my question is, what happens to TechCrunch now?
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.000]   Well, I think we're going to focus on scoops and not digs
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.840]   for the next couple of weeks, at least.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.480]   We've got FA coming up.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.000]   And--
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.120]   The big Facebook conference.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.440]   We'll ask you about that in a second, yeah.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.880]   And I'm sure there'll be a couple of announcements there
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.040]   that aren't internal stuff.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.880]   You've been multiple--
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.320]   Leaving?
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.280]   But to MG's point, though, I thought
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.200]   it was interesting is, Alexia, you're not leaving, right?
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.320]   You're going to stay.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.760]   You know, I am not leaving, not right now.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.280]   Probably staying--
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:37.800]   Not today.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.640]   I think it's a better work at TechCrunch.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   It's what I like to do.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.400]   But--
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   TechCrunch is a great opportunity, especially right now,
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.480]   because it does have a lot of attention.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.040]   I think AOL is going to be very anxious to justify
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.440]   its purchase of TechCrunch, right?
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.480]   And it's been only a year.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   And they also want to prove that TechCrunch can
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.720]   concede without succeeding with my gang to my character.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   And they still have a great--
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.840]   and Paul Carr.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.680]   And they've got great writers still like you.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.520]   MG, I think Sarah--
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.960]   when Sarah come back soon?
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.720]   In four months.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.040]   I think she's going to come back for--
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.280]   she's going to come back for Disrep Beijing for a little bit.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.640]   I know with her baby with Eli.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.680]   But she tweeted that if a winner of TechCrunch,
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.360]   Disrep was at the Israeli company, she would quit.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.880]   I think--
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.400]   I saw the twig.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.520]   I think she was joking.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.240]   No, really?
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.840]   I mean, from what I see, people take stuff too seriously.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.720]   Like, I think Paul Carr made fun of a writer Jack
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.600]   McKenna, which is Errington's pen name in a blog.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.960]   He made fun of a writer.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.600]   And then there was an Italian publication that--
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.080]   Picked it up.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.360]   Picked it up as not a joke.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:36.860]   As news.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.120]   So people take this way seriously.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.720]   With departures at TechCrunch, are they hiring writers?
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.280]   Yeah, we're hiring writers.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.680]   And those hires are made by the editor?
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.760]   Ariana, probably.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.280]   Are they the editor of TechCrunch?
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.680]   Eric Schoenfeld, editor.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.200]   But who makes the hires?
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.480]   I think Eric Schoenfeld.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.320]   What does Ariana know about TechCrunch?
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.400]   Well, I can be right.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   That's terrible.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.920]   You're talking about your bus here.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.600]   Well, she was she-
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.920]   I honestly don't think she cares that much.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.840]   No.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.120]   If she's smart, she'll, as Barry Diller said,
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.600]   she'll just let TechCrunch be TechCrunch.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.660]   I mean, Barry was really--
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.820]   It seemed like that's what AOL was doing.
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.740]   At least for a couple of months,
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.500]   it seemed like it was the same old TechCrunch.
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.740]   And then not only until two weeks ago,
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.740]   did we learn that that was not the case.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.300]   And I'm sure it had to do with the raising of the funds,
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.860]   which AOL put money into.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.220]   Well, if you go to TechCrunch, though--
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.420]   If you go to TechMean, the top two stories today
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.820]   are two TechCrunch stories by MG and Matt Burns.
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.820]   You break stories, and that's good.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.780]   And I just-- the only reason I think it's
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.420]   an important issue is I feel for readers and viewers
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.240]   and I'll include our viewers as well,
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.120]   who have to decipher who is and whose pocket,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.160]   whose objective--
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.760]   And I guess you've always had to decipher that.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.940]   And you just have to use your judgment
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.360]   and watch what people say and judge from that,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.760]   whether you can trust what they say, right?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.600]   I mean, you just--
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.840]   Does the product, though, get watered down?
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.240]   I mean, that was MG's point, right?
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.200]   That it would be-- that there's a possibility
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.120]   that it could become like CNET.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.080]   Welcome to mainstream media.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.600]   The product always gets watered down.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.760]   I mean, but that's the edginess.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.840]   That's what people turn to TechCrunch for.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.720]   That's why I read it.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.340]   And you worry that that product that gets diluted
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.780]   and MG's point about CNET then being watered down,
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.580]   not the edginess properly that it was.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.060]   It all starts with the founder and the great vision.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.120]   And then it gets-- every startup starts
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.260]   with the founder a great vision,
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.100]   and then it's a process of watering down from then on.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.540]   Isn't it?
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.380]   It's very rare that the startup can maintain
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.780]   that unique flavor that it had on day one.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.580]   Yeah, well, there's Apple.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.100]   That's right.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.660]   And that's exactly-- that's the exception
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.380]   the pros are real, isn't it?
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.300]   Yeah, very, very few.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.140]   In fact, I look at it right.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:35.340]   Facebook.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.500]   I want to talk about Facebook.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.100]   There's a group of people.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.460]   Because I think Facebook has started to become watered down.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.900]   But we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.300]   I want to talk about Windows 8, because that's really
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.140]   the big story of the week.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.460]   And I didn't want to get sidetracked by the TechCrunch.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.660]   But we kind of-- because Alexia is here,
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.860]   and because you're such a defender of Mike,
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.620]   I had to bring it up.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.820]   Do you remember when 30 minutes of every show was about Twitter?
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.300]   I don't remember that.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.940]   Yeah, those days, fortunately over.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.660]   For the most part?
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.740]   That's happening.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.540]   Twitter is no longer the thing it was.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.460]   But let's take a break.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.100]   We're going to come back.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.740]   I want to show you Windows 8.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.820]   In fact, in the week, I'm really pleased he was at Build
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.060]   and brought back this Samsung tablet that they gave all
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.020]   the developers.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.220]   And we can't wait to play with it.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.180]   So we'll talk about it.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.980]   And what you think of Windows 8 in just a second,
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.660]   but before we do that, I would like
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.700]   to talk a little bit about GoToMyPC.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.500]   Speaking of tablets, GoToMyPC now supports the iPad.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.500]   That means you can use the iPad to access your office
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.060]   computer, Windows or Mac, anywhere.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.340]   Just this lightweight thing you carry around.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.100]   You log into your GoToMyPC account.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.660]   It's completely secure.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.500]   It's a VPN, in effect.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.620]   Secured link back to your office.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.500]   And there's your Windows machine.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.780]   You can send and receive email, run any program, access
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.620]   any network resource.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.060]   Do anything you want with your iPad or your Mac or your PC.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.980]   It really is the best way to do remote access.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.340]   Go to my PC by Citrix.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.580]   I've been using it for years.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.580]   And I am such a fan.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.420]   And now that I can do it on the iPad, I'm even happier.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.660]   No IT help is required.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.940]   Set up as a snap.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:08.100]   Go to myPC.com on the desktop that you want to access first.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.300]   Click the try it free button.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.660]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.500]   Just type that in.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.340]   And set up that 30 day free account.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.780]   Now it's on your computer.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.700]   Now you go to the app store on the iPad.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.740]   And just download the free GoToMyPC app.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.140]   And you'll be operating.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.220]   You'll be up and running in minutes.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.020]   No IT help.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:24.420]   Nothing.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.900]   Just very simple.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.820]   And by the way, we are going to give away a free iPad
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.740]   right now.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.900]   Would you like to win an iPad?
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.420]   All right.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.500]   So here's how it's going to work.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.100]   I want you to tweet with a hashtag TWIT free iPad.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.580]   Going, OK, I'm doing it right now.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.100]   You can't do it.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.540]   Oh.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.220]   Employees of Fox networks and their--
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.180]   I'm not afraid of the answer.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:46.540]   Not allowed.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:52.100]   Pound TWIT free iPad through September 22.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.260]   And if you tweet with that hashtag,
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.740]   they'll be looking at all those tweets
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.100]   through September 22.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.660]   And then next week on TWIT will announce the winner of an iPad
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.140]   2.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.100]   So how about that?
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.540]   And then, of course, don't forget
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.100]   to go to myPC.com for your free 30-day trial promo code.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.700]   TWIT, we thank Citrix for their support.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.140]   And actually, here's the question.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.820]   Actually, I want you to answer your question.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.580]   In the tweet, answer this question.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.740]   This is a little research that Citrix wants to do.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.380]   Which file or program on your home or office computer
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.860]   would be most helpful to access on your iPad?
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.620]   What's the program that you would use GoToMyPC
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.580]   to access on your iPad?
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.740]   So answer it.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.300]   It could just be one word answer.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.100]   Microsoft Outlook or whatever.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.500]   Put the hashtag TWIT free iPad in there.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.300]   And you'll be entered to win a new iPad 2 from GoToMyPC.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.940]   Details and contest rules are where.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.820]   Do we know?
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.500]   Somewhere.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.500]   Somewhere.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.700]   Somewhere out there.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.780]   Probably--
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.500]   You've seen the show notes.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.000]   They are.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.940]   I think they're in the show notes.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:00.300]   Thank you.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.420]   David Prager, that's why you're the man in charge
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.220]   of revision 3.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.700]   I know that when you do contests, you've
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.500]   got to have rules.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.340]   You've got to have rules.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.620]   Actually, do you want to podcast?
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.140]   I guess you can't.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.780]   You have to say no perse necessary.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.700]   Otherwise, there's a lot of rules.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.140]   Like if it's more than $600, the prize,
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.380]   you've got to follow additional rules or something.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.020]   Because you have to give--
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.140]   Because we're not ready to do it.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.580]   We're not ready to do it.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.660]   That says something--
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.460]   Radio stations.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.860]   I mean, when we did on radio, you'd have to say,
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.100]   rules available at the office come by and get it out.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.140]   I mean, there was all this stuff.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.940]   But I don't know if you have to do that.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.460]   I know that when--
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.940]   Does anybody regulate us at all?
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.660]   Absolutely.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.700]   The bigger the medium grows, the more viewers
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.020]   to it gets, the more viewers revision 3 gets.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.660]   Are you out of the blogger that regulates all sorts?
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.020]   Who regulates blogs?
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.540]   Oh, there's some FCC regulation.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.580]   No, there's not.
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.460]   FCC?
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.060]   FTC, probably.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.580]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.140]   Where you have to disclose if you have taken money
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.980]   from a product when you're writing about the product.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.580]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.140]   I think so.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.140]   I don't think Erington follows those rules.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:57.660]   Yes, he does.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.460]   He's too close.
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.460]   You know what's interesting?
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.060]   It's actually interesting because Schoenfeld--
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.140]   Oh, here we go.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:02.820]   All right, no, no, no.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.980]   OK, I'm not going to--
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.900]   [SINGING]
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.380]   Erington's time.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.820]   I mean, he's fascinating.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.860]   That's exactly it.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:14.220]   And it's really good for clicks.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.900]   Here's what I love about Erington.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.900]   He managed to bring all this attention to the blog
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.220]   and then deflect that--
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.340]   Or deflect that attention to it.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.300]   All the negative attention deflected to himself.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.380]   And the blog is all about it.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.380]   And the start-ups that we write that on the blog.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.020]   Well, you should see the thread I got
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.700]   that's comments on my blog post.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.900]   I got some negative attention too.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.620]   It's amazing how many trolls you guys carry behind you.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.020]   Yes, yes.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.620]   I like that it's all Facebook comments,
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.340]   or at least the fact that they try to make it so that you
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:42.780]   have to have a name.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.940]   You have to log on a Facebook.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.780]   But you have to have a name.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.780]   I mean, I don't know if I like the fact
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.500]   that it has to be Facebook, but I like the name--
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.620]   I like that it could be just be anonymous.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.500]   So I'm going to mean-- look at the difference between the comments
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.500]   on something like YouTube.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.780]   Oh, YouTube is horrible.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.980]   It's useless because of that.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.900]   But Facebook has-- I mean, also, the part of the thing
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.420]   about the personality is writing these articles
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.780]   is that you get active discussions in the comments,
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:03.540]   which I think is--
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.020]   I agree.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.500]   --is fun, because you don't see that a lot of--
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.260]   Do you Google+?
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.420]   --going to go on a down publication?
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.180]   You Google+,?
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.940]   I did a lot of it.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.980]   Don't very much anymore.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.020]   However, I don't think the reason that I don't use it.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.660]   I think most of it is because I'm so busy,
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.260]   and I haven't been able to decide to adopt it.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.700]   I love it.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.620]   But I think it's huge.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.140]   I love it too.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:18.700]   I love it too.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.180]   I love it.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:19.980]   But now I don't have time.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.980]   See, you-- it's fashionable these days.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.420]   You're like me out of fashion on this.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.700]   It's fashionable these days you say,
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.020]   no, I stopped using Google+.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.420]   I hear that this week.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.540]   Well, I'm saying, because I actually stopped using it.
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:30.540]   But--
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.140]   No, I didn't say you, Alexia, in person.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.020]   There was nothing personal.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.860]   There is a lot of people.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.380]   But there is a lot of people.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:37.820]   And I think--
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.740]   No, I've moved on.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.060]   I think it's normal you go up.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.180]   If you're a social network, you'll
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.420]   unset you go up, and then there is a big, you go down,
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.860]   and now you get the real users.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.860]   Let's talk about an old company, a mainline computing
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.200]   company.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.700]   They're called Microsoft.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.220]   And they had a big conference this week called Build.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.180]   It was the first Build conference
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.980]   they're combining their developers conference,
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.740]   PDC, with their hardware conference
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.100]   Winek, with their web conference mix,
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.300]   into one massive thing in Anaheim.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.580]   And of course, they did something
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.300]   that Google's been doing all along
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.780]   at their developers' conferences.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.140]   They handed out hardware running the new operating system.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.580]   Steven Sonofsky, who's running the Windows 8 development team,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.580]   became quite famous at Office for being a straight shooter,
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.740]   not saying anything until it was so.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.740]   Really being reliable, he's been blogging a lot
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.940]   about Windows 8.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.900]   And one of the things-- correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.380]   One of the things that's my understanding that Steven said
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.100]   is, yes, understand that we are giving you a developer's preview.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.940]   They did make it available to everyone.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.180]   You can go to buildwindows.com and download it.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.540]   Anybody can.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.780]   And millions have.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.380]   He said that.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.060]   But he also said, this is the final version in terms of OS.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.820]   Don't expect us to take a lot of feedback and change this a lot.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.420]   And so normally, when I see a developer's preview,
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.300]   I probably would just say, well, there it is.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:55.860]   It's a preview.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.300]   It's probably going to change a lot,
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.260]   especially with Microsoft Windows.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.140]   Remember what we saw with Vista when it first-- when
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.940]   it was Longhorn, and then what they finally came out with,
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.020]   it changed a lot.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.740]   But have they told-- like, you're a developer,
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.820]   so you have the tablet.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.220]   I'm not myself a developer, my team.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.980]   Sure, you see me.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.180]   I need a developer.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.260]   And they gave you-- so this is the tablet.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.140]   Thank you for bringing this.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.380]   This is the Samsung that they handed out.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.700]   And one thing you immediately notice is it's snappy as heck.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.780]   This thing moves along.
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.460]   This is a--
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:21.980]   Look at that.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.860]   I love this one.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   Whoa.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.500]   What is really staggering at all?
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.860]   Oh, you need to be in an app.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.300]   So see you do this.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.220]   Oh, look at that.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.020]   That's cool.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.780]   This is how you switch from app to app.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.220]   And then you can split screen.
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.580]   So see now.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.420]   I'm going to do--
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.180]   Half and half?
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:37.680]   --fuse.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.180]   See?
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.620]   Oh, I missed.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.220]   How do I do that?
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.140]   I just thought you were sure you--
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:41.660]   Oh, look at that.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.540]   That's an outside of the box.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.180]   So you can have tick meme here and tick-cringe here.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.100]   That's what they've been saying, Clayton,
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.180]   is that the Windows re-imagined.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.900]   That's the tagline for this.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.860]   It really is.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.980]   And you know that they're not phoning it in here.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.300]   I mean, this is not a copycat as they were saying
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.220]   other tablets in the market as if we
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.060]   don't know who they're talking about.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.220]   But this is really--
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.260]   and this is what I loved about Windows Phone.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.580]   I mean, Windows Phone is exciting.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.860]   Sadly, I've never seen one in the wild.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.380]   But I have.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.220]   And you know what?
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.060]   This is almost identical to Windows Phone.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.860]   That's what's interesting.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.740]   If you turn this on inside and shrunk it down--
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.180]   Yeah, it does.
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:20.700]   --that's a lot like--
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.200]   Metro.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.340]   That's the Windows Phone interface.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.220]   And I'll grant you this.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.340]   This is a great tablet interface.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.140]   The problem is, as far as I can tell,
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.220]   this is also the start menu on the desktop version of Windows.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.860]   And that's where I'm a little bit more worried.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.740]   I've got it running here in emulation on my Macintosh.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.140]   I don't have touch capability.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.620]   So everything I'm going to have to do now
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.700]   I'm going to do with the mouse.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.940]   So they've designed-- it seems like they've been vocal about
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.380]   designing it to be able to be interfaced with the touchscreen
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.180]   and without a touchscreen.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.940]   They want the same kind of user experience.
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.420]   What it seems to be is one UI to serve them all.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.980]   So in other words, we're not going
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.980]   to care whether you're a tablet, desktop, laptop, phone.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.420]   This is the UI.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.380]   And I'm not sure that you can do that.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.580]   I don't know if you can successfully--
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.780]   Can you apply a tablet metaphor to a desktop computer?
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.820]   This is what Akro's trying to do with OS 10 Lion.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.500]   And it's terrible.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.660]   It's the same kind of--
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.460]   You know, I like Lion.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.660]   So this is running on Lion.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.980]   So I can swipe over and have different windows open.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.260]   To me, this is still a desktop metaphor
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.420]   with some tablet-like features.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.020]   This is the start menu.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.420]   There is no more start menu in Windows 8.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.620]   You can hack it, but then it really isn't Windows 8 anymore.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.020]   This is the start menu now.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.620]   In fact, even if I go to the desktop--
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.980]   well, they have a little desktop tile here.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.860]   This looks very much like the Windows 7 desktop.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.500]   Until you click the start menu, and that's it.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.500]   I'm curious.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.140]   I mean, playing with it, does it translate?
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.740]   I mean, that's the question, right?
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.260]   Because taking that tablet--
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.740]   I like Lion as well.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.620]   But they're stark differences.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.660]   And going from gesture control to touch is a huge leap.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.700]   That's a big leap, right?
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.860]   Going from just a four-finger swipe on a trackpad
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.500]   to actually touching icons, moving things around on a screen
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.540]   and as opposed to using a mouse to do it.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.260]   I don't know that it translates between them.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.620]   But it's still early.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.900]   One of the big problems, though, is that this
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.700]   doesn't come out for quite a while.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.340]   So trying to gain markets here, trying to gain traction
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.300]   in this space right now, which is moving at a clip.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.860]   And you've got other competitors like Apple out there
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.860]   on the tablet space so far ahead of everyone else.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.500]   Now, wait a year for this to come out.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.100]   I think Windows is woefully behind.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.580]   Incidentally, JMax asked me in the chat room,
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.100]   is this going to change how Office looks?
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.100]   And Microsoft has said, yeah, this
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.380]   is the interface for Office as well.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.020]   So this is the new ribbon.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.860]   This is the-- your team is developer.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.700]   Clearly on the tablet, this is good.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.340]   I think this is a first decent tablet interface that's not
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:51.860]   Apple.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.860]   I think we're just betting on the fact that the desktop, as we
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.900]   know it, is just going to go away.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.660]   So you're focusing on the past, that this is all going to go
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:01.860]   away.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.860]   So my worry about--
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.940]   We'll only do touch.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.140]   But see, this is where I worry for Microsoft,
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.260]   because Microsoft's core business is business.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.220]   Where they are going to be using desktops.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.340]   They may use tablets too.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.780]   So VC is the perfect--
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.220]   For the executive, for the sales staff.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.180]   Self-people.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:17.740]   Self-people.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.860]   Yeah, but what about the accountant?
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.540]   What about the--
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.020]   Yeah, oh my god.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.540]   I walk around my office building.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.300]   We've got, what, a 35 floor?
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.020]   You've got the Wall Street Journal in my building.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.620]   You've got all-- and everyone is--
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.700]   I think they're still running in a lot of these computers,
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.780]   still like Windows 2000.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.500]   And Blackberrys?
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.540]   Oh, it was a lot of black.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.820]   I just could never see these individuals with all due
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.900]   respect to a lot of them.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.500]   I mean, they're-- they don't even know
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.220]   how to use cut and paste.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.020]   And they're so used to that system that they're using.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.460]   I just can't see them sitting there with a touchscreen,
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.420]   reaching out on one of those HP touch smarts.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.940]   I think it's looking through files.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.260]   I just don't think it's going to happen.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.580]   Oh, I mean, I have to go.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.180]   In 10 years, this thing is going to cost $200.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.180]   Well, that'd be shit to talk about it.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.860]   And you're going to be able to apply all kinds of keyboard
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.380]   peripherals to it and attach to external displays.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.020]   And the fact that they cost the equivalent of $200 or so,
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.700]   you're going to be able to have the old accounting team
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.780]   at the Wall Street Journal be able to adopt it pretty quickly.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.380]   So you're saying--
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.620]   I'm asking the wrong question.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.180]   I shouldn't be saying, how does this work on a desktop?
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:15.620]   I should be--
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.180]   That's the wrong question.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.380]   That's the wrong question.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.140]   It really isn't about the desktop anymore.
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.860]   It's gone.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.740]   Forget the desktop.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.340]   It's dead.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:21.900]   Gone.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.140]   Nobody will use it.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.340]   Last year, I did the--
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:24.820]   You're a writer.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.060]   Are you going to write on a tablet?
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:26.420]   Nope.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.260]   No way.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.820]   You need to keep one.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.540]   If it gets better, it's getting better.
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.780]   Or more and more to type on glass.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.060]   And it recognizes words.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.020]   Like, for example, when I switched to--
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.580]   From English to French.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.380]   For me, it's great because I don't have to switch keyboard.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.100]   So it switches for me and you recognize--
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.660]   Are we talking about using one of those like Acer Iconia tablet
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.180]   type on the app?
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.940]   I mean, I just don't see it.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.100]   I mean, I'm a tech blogger.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.140]   And I'm still-- I've never written a blog post on a tablet.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.380]   And I don't think I will until I force it.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.260]   It seems like I'd be a lot of work typing on glass.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.220]   But you don't have to.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.460]   You'll always be able to put it--
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.420]   I've been on a plane.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.660]   And there's a guy who hangs his iPad on the seat in front of him
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.300]   and pulls his little Bluetooth keyboard out and goes to town.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.780]   But at that point, you would go to town
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.620]   like that writing an article.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.820]   Sure, but that's what I'm not looking for.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.900]   But it doesn't mean that I'm going to get a lot of my way
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.420]   right now.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.420]   Yes, I've got my laptop.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.060]   Well, I'd rather have a MacBook Air.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.300]   Pretty soon.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:13.780]   I mean, I think--
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.300]   This is to me better than an iPad.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.300]   I don't carry the iPad around.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.740]   I carry this around.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.700]   It's easy.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.020]   It's got a keyboard.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.700]   And it really strikes me as strange.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.180]   And I see people with an iPad and a keyboard.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.180]   It's like, well, dude--
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:25.820]   Don't get it.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.820]   Get a laptop.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.820]   Just go off the laptop.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.820]   Get a laptop.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.020]   And Mauricio is holding up.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.220]   Actually, that's the Logitech.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.340]   That's the Zag case that you put your iPad in.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.940]   And it's a Bluetooth folding keyboard.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.660]   It's actually very compact.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.380]   Yeah, the correct--
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.420]   But you're not using that.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.940]   You're using an MacBook.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.020]   All right.
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.540]   Now, for developers who question you,
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.940]   I think they are very excited.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.540]   They are.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.500]   One of the strengths--
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.700]   I wouldn't discount the chances of Microsoft
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.580]   to succeed in this.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.300]   Because if you look at Xbox versus Sony,
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.660]   they actually want huge--
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.220]   That's true.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:57.820]   --aspect, right?
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.300]   That's true.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.620]   So yes, they're late.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.820]   But they have proven in the past that they can come late.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.180]   And they have hundreds of millions of users of Windows
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:04.900]   already.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.980]   Well, that's what concerns me.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.260]   Because I think that those that install user base
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.540]   is the one that's going to be most resistant to this.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.060]   Right.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.260]   Because if this were a startup company,
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.420]   then I might be more excited.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.260]   If you look at the developers, they
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.820]   will build there are a lot of Windows developers.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.660]   And the feedback I get from my team
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.060]   is that it's very easy to cut off.
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.420]   So that's the key.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:24.980]   And--
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.620]   That's the key.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.380]   Yeah, they like it.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.340]   They're very impressed.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.180]   So I think you'll see a lot of apps.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:29.540]   But doesn't--
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.820]   What about upgrade from Clayton?
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.700]   Clayton, go ahead.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.140]   Well, I was just saying, what about upgrades?
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.700]   I mean, what do you say to the IT department?
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.300]   I don't pick up on the point that David was making.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.660]   Because I think it's fascinating.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.740]   You look at an IT department.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.900]   They're sitting there scratching their head.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.660]   Can we do an upgrade?
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.100]   I mean, where does an IT department go from here?
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.940]   Well, the IT department, that's a good point too.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.700]   Because last year, there was a Dreamforce for Salesforce
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.180]   Conference.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:54.100]   And last year, 70% of people surveyed in IT
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.140]   were saying, never.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.140]   We'll never let iPads in and tablets in a surprise.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.180]   We don't want it.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:28:59.820]   We don't support it.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.780]   And that's exactly why everybody loves it.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.420]   And now the IT department hates it.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:03.900]   Exactly.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.140]   You know what happened?
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.860]   So I think the IT department is really, really a bad point.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.140]   Because what happened is everybody
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.300]   brought their own tablets.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   They bought their own.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.300]   They didn't take expensive.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.140]   They made them move.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.340]   And now Salesforce, I mean, they openly
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.500]   admit building their infrastructure on iPads.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.420]   And that's what I'm saying is the IT world now has had to--
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.300]   it's what they call the consumerization of enterprise
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.620]   is that there are so much push of consumers going
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.940]   to their office with an iPad that they now
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.100]   have to basically spot it.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.860]   And what I see is more and more salespeople, management,
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.780]   executives just using iPads.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.900]   It was a big amount of headphones in our office.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.140]   They have an iPad.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.740]   So what--
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.460]   Look, that's an Apple device.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.140]   I love Apple.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:45.900]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.580]   But I wouldn't discount this as a big success.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.900]   I think it will be a big success.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.900]   We'll see.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.420]   Imagine if this was an Apple--
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.420]   Windows.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.820]   This was Windows 8 as a desktop.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.420]   Imagine if you could flip that around and make it--
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.340]   If we were convertible.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.340]   Convert into a tablet.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.580]   But run the same operating system
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.180]   and use it in quote unquote tablet mode or desktop mode
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.980]   with the same operating system.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.500]   That's possibly the real strength of this, isn't it?
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.220]   Microsoft's always had trouble with tablets.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.500]   It must have called them after 10 years of pushing tablets
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.300]   that Apple comes in and boom, just takes over.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.820]   But that's Bill Gates's war that he lost.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.540]   I don't know if Microsoft, the current Microsoft,
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.140]   worries so much about that.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.940]   But I've had a convertible Windows tablet for years.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.540]   And it was just very awkward and gainly
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.380]   because you put the touch on top of--
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.620]   Those compact ones, right?
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.380]   Yeah, and I have an HP, exactly, HP compact.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.420]   But that's because you basically added touches
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.460]   and afterthought to Windows.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.700]   This feels more like Windows is a touch interface first.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.100]   And maybe a desktop, a distant second.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.820]   People are pointing out in the chatroom
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.780]   that Windows underneath has been improved.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.540]   There's a new kernel.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.740]   There's a lot of rewriting that's gone on.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.780]   But I don't know if users really are aware of that
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.420]   or care about that.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.980]   Developers might care more about that.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.620]   The user's going to be looking at the UI.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.740]   I think there will be high end machines.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.740]   And the iPad will own, as it already owns, the IAN machines.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.540]   Like they do on the laptop.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.540]   The high price.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.060]   The high end, yeah, high price.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.060]   And this is going to come very cheap, but I think you like--
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:12.580]   You'll say so.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.580]   Very, very low cost devices.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.540]   And the rest of the world will really like for low cost devices.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.100]   I'm curious.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.820]   What incentives does Microsoft give to developers on this?
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.180]   Oh, we don't get anything.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.620]   No, see, that's a great point.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.540]   We don't.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.020]   We don't.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.020]   If Microsoft were smart here, wouldn't they
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.780]   come to developers and get a bunch of the key developers
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.220]   on task and say, look, we're going to cut you a check.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.740]   We want you guys developing for Windows 8.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.140]   We want to bring over some of these marquee developers,
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.020]   get them out there in front so that when a year from now,
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.940]   it's a robust app store.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.180]   It's a robust experience.
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:49.980]   There are some people--
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.820]   That's what's happening.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.740]   I mean, this is the developer preview.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.420]   They told developers, you can develop now for this.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.420]   It's not going to change too much.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.420]   So this is what you're going to be developing for.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.100]   And remember, Clayton, they don't have to give money
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.620]   to developers.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.700]   They just have to say one word, 450 million.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.740]   But you know what it's all about.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.260]   It's stall, Windows users.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.580]   If you're a developer, whether it's malware or an office
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.100]   suite, that's what you care about, right?
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.900]   But more than just developers, if you look at the app
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.220]   infrastructure, they're going to popular apps.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.460]   And they're going to see what's the most popular Android
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.220]   and iPhone apps.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.220]   And they're going after those people and saying, look,
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.500]   you need to make one for Windows 7.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.220]   Well, you could bet that the an angry bird is on this.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.140]   But those people are saying, no, we don't want to.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.460]   And so Microsoft is giving them money to do it.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.180]   So they are doing it.
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.180]   Absolutely.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.340]   I'm on the phone.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.740]   I have a friend who took $50,000
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.260]   so he could put his app on the Windows phone.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:36.820]   So they are doing it.
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.900]   Well, wait, wait, wait.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.300]   That's the phone.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:39.980]   Yeah, on the phone.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.340]   I know.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   OK, but I'm saying.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.300]   Develop for the phone.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.380]   You're kind of halfway there.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.460]   You go after the phone.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:44.940]   No.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.780]   No, no, that's my-- so let me remove my Microsoft fanboy.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.620]   How far second?
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.220]   There you go.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:50.740]   There you go.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.820]   No, it's not-- that's a huge issue.
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.380]   If you're a developer, we built a Windows 7 app.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.260]   And it doesn't work there.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.460]   It's not the same.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.900]   So it's civilite on the phone.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.860]   Even though it's JavaScript and CSS and HTML5,
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:04.740]   you have to recode.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.820]   That's a big issue now.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.420]   I mean, Microsoft could actually--
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.420]   It's the same with Apple.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.220]   It doesn't run the Mac either, right?
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.820]   Get out your checkbook, Microsoft.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.900]   They piss money away on Microsoft Kin concerts.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.380]   Did you guys see the marketing material for the Kin?
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.860]   We had it in our house.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.380]   It just like--
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.300]   I love it.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.460]   I still have mine.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.020]   And I think it's going to be a museum.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.020]   Can I tell you something?
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.460]   I actually recommended the Kin on the radio show
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.460]   a couple of weeks ago.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.300]   No.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.380]   And people are mocking me.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.940]   But in fact, somebody called up, said,
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.940]   I want a smartphone that's not a smartphone.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.660]   I don't want to pay the data plan.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.660]   I want a phone that I can text with,
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.820]   that I can do some of the smartphone features with.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.420]   But I don't want such a complicated thing.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.900]   The Kin is actually-- if you don't have to pay the $30 a month
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.140]   data plan, it's actually a great choice for kids,
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.380]   for young people, for people who don't want to pay the money.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:54.940]   I don't--
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.940]   The Kin was a great phone?
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.540]   I got blasted the same as you did.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.380]   I actually liked it.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.020]   I said the same thing.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.540]   And--
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.340]   The mistake they made with the Kin was the data plan.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:04.940]   Right.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.060]   And it just didn't seem complete, too.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.740]   And you couldn't use Twitter on it.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.060]   I mean, there were some weird things with it.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.180]   But you couldn't get it anywhere.
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.060]   Can you still get it?
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:14.660]   Is it still a man?
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:14.980]   No, you can.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.580]   And the real problem is Verizon, which sells it,
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.620]   doesn't push it ever because they don't make money
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.900]   on the data plan.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.220]   So they say, oh, you don't want that.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.260]   You want an iPhone because they want the extra $1,000 or $2,000
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.020]   they'll make over the life of the phone.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:30.980]   That's a big difference.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.340]   Everybody loves the weather app, by the way, on Wednesday.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.900]   We got a little beach.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.740]   We got--
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:37.420]   The moves.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.340]   We got moves.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.140]   See the water.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.660]   It's sunny, sunny, sunny.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.620]   Sunny, sunny.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.740]   We got 90 degrees.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.460]   90 degrees, beautiful weather.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.540]   I was showing you, Leo.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.980]   I really liked the writing apps.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.700]   I mean, for unfortunately, the pen-- yes, there's a pen.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.740]   People will laugh on that.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:51.420]   But there's a pen.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.380]   Come to the stylist?
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:52.900]   Yes.
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.140]   It's in the car somewhere.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:54.860]   But see, I wrote--
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.500]   It's in the car.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.660]   That's the problem.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.460]   In a nutshell.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.260]   It's an art book.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.100]   But try to do this on a nightpad.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.340]   I have a--
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.700]   It's very high resolution.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.220]   You could ask why you would try to do this on a nightpad,
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:05.220]   though.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.740]   But many people take notes.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.660]   Like, they don't want paper at all.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.900]   And then you recognize it.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.060]   You voted 63%--
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.980]   Yeah, well, that was wrong.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.260]   And cleared it up.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:14.820]   How do I type it?
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.060]   No, you need a pen.
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.300]   The stylist.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.740]   So it's in the car-- whatever.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.900]   That works pretty well, actually.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.420]   Well, does it a special kind of pen?
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:24.180]   Can I use my type?
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.740]   I bet it is.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.300]   Anyway.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:26.660]   All right.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.020]   So I was able to do this with my mouse.
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.220]   And when you do a stroke, it does kind of--
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.100]   it tidies it up.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:33.600]   See that?
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.100]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.100]   And now if you go down, you'll have recognized it.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.180]   So it does recognize you?
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.740]   I don't know how you do it with the mouse.
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.740]   I think you're right.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:41.300]   Oh, here you go.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:41.620]   OK.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.100]   So now here you have recognized.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.820]   Recognize.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.380]   Oh, let's see if it recognizes this is Windows 8.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.020]   Loaded 20 strokes.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:48.540]   This is--
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.100]   83.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.740]   If it recognizes that, then all the CAP jaws are out the door.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.060]   Well, let me write more clearly.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.420]   I didn't realize it was doing that.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:55.860]   It works pretty well.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.260]   You can do this on a trackpad on a MacBook Pro
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.340]   too or a MacBook Air, right?
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.460]   You can do that in picture passwords.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.020]   Let me try it.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.900]   No, you can't really--
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.660]   Yeah, I don't think this is designed to be used with a mouse.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.100]   Yeah, I love how it cleans it up.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.060]   So this is actually one note technology.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.220]   This is something Microsoft's had for a while.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.140]   Oops, let's not get out of there.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:18.260]   Where many new patents they had to file and combat to build this?
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.580]   Oh, god, don't get us started on software pens.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.700]   You know, it's sexy.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.220]   I like it.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.580]   But I just worry that the main stay of Windows
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:32.300]   is people who really want this desktop, a smart menu,
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.540]   join the expression blend.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.460]   Oh, this is the development environment.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:35.940]   Yep.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.900]   This is free also, which is pretty cool.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.340]   I think--
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:42.860]   And you see that now I have a taskbar at the bottom.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.620]   I mean, if you take down the lower third,
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.660]   you see the taskbar is here.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.540]   This is very Windows 7 looking.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.340]   I don't know if you're saying--
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.260]   I don't know if you're saying it.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:50.780]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.460]   What I think they want is this will run Excel to your accountants
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.300]   point, and then you will run all the desktop apps.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.380]   And basically, what they want is, I guess, people to have buff.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.060]   So when they don't need the keyboard,
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.100]   they'll have a great tablet.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.820]   And anyway, we work for Microsoft today.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.540]   And investors like to do it.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.140]   If you saw--
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.780]   I was just saying I was just saying--
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.500]   They don't like Clayton.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.820]   Go ahead, say game Clayton.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.300]   I was just saying investors like to do.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.020]   If you looked at Microsoft earlier in the week,
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.060]   I think it was like $25 a share.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.660]   By the end of the week, I think it ended the week over $27.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.780]   So yeah, investors are seeing something
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.020]   exciting for Microsoft for the first time in a while.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.780]   And that wasn't the case a few weeks ago.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.220]   We were seeing Microsoft shares keep
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.300]   dipping and dipping and dipping.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.220]   So somebody's liking it, and some analysts are seeing this.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.540]   I'm just curious who's going to buy it.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.140]   And I'm curious how you can get a forecast like that again.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.380]   When it's going to take a year, right?
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.260]   Is it about a year to market for this?
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.260]   And it's in town before--
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.540]   They haven't made any dates, but I would guess
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.220]   this will be summer 2012 that this comes out.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.860]   They're going to have a public preview, public beta later
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.340]   this year.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.900]   I think that we're talking June.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.740]   September, maybe.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.460]   You think September?
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:57.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.460]   Certainly before September.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:58.820]   I don't know.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.020]   September is when you need to--
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.780]   I would say June or July, because you
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.140]   want to get in the back to school market
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.540]   and the holiday buying market.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.980]   I think that was a problem they had with both Windows 7
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.740]   and Windows Vista's.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.220]   They missed the ship date.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.180]   Remember, it came out in January or February,
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.340]   which is about the worst time you could.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.220]   The search for big issue is that if you cut for the phone,
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.140]   it doesn't run the tablet.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.580]   It's not subject.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.180]   If you cut for the tablet, it doesn't run on the phone.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.980]   Yet, they say, nothing official.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.380]   But that's a pain because you need two apps.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.740]   So they're saying there won't do many changes on this.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.900]   You think this will still look new in a year?
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.140]   Well, that's a good question, too,
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.780]   because as you said, Loik, it's a very fast moving market.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.460]   Apple's not going to sit still.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.020]   Apple will have another iPad before then.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:39.460]   I don't know.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.460]   This is a--
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.260]   You know, I can--
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:41.820]   And there's been great--
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.540]   I'm going to have to say I'm going to moderate my thoughts.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.140]   At first, I was very negative about this
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.100]   because I was really concerned about the attempt
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.340]   to take one metaphor across all these platforms.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.460]   So you've convinced me otherwise, Loik.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.260]   Good Microsoft, you can give me more money.
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.340]   We'll talk after a show.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.420]   I will give the benefit of that.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.620]   And the thing that I've always said-- and you do
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.740]   have to commend them for us, at least trying.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.380]   At least, instead of saying, well, I'm just
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.540]   going to do more of the same, let's do something really, really--
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.140]   Well, it's a question of life or death, I think.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:10.660]   You think so?
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:10.980]   They had to do--
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.940]   Well, Windows Phone 7 and Nokia, right?
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.900]   Nokia is going to die if he doesn't work.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:15.340]   Right.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:15.820]   Kelly.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.020]   And I think Microsoft cannot scrub the phone
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.220]   and it's the same with a tablet.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.380]   So I don't think they're trying.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.940]   I think they just have to, right?
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:22.460]   Right.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.980]   Yeah, if they're business software and they're not mobile
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.140]   and they're not in the mobile space,
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.180]   it's being dominated by the iPad, you're right.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:28.980]   It's sink or swim.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.780]   And there's only so long you can survive.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.260]   And I'm thinking that enterprise space,
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.740]   certainly seeing it with BlackBerry, certainly seeing it
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.420]   with rim this week with the terrible news from rim.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.740]   What was the terrible news for rim?
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:40.300]   Are they out of business?
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.380]   Are they going to get rid of the play--
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.740]   Or are they going to fire, say, a play with--
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.780]   Play with a huge fail.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.380]   And I think--
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.620]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.620]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.660]   I mean, in one quarter going from a million devices sold
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.820]   down to 200,000 devices within the same quarter,
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.780]   I mean, the CEOs are off the rocker.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.860]   I don't know what they're thinking.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.100]   And the other thing I think is they
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.420]   burned half of a cash in a few quarters.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.820]   Like, a cash is going away, like really fast.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.660]   That's what you're saying.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.740]   So you guys will agree with Matt Honan writing for Gizmodo
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.220]   who said, if you already hate Windows 8,
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.300]   then you hate technology.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.100]   I like that one.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.220]   I like Matt Honan.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.940]   That's great, of course.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.580]   You can't just look at something and dismiss it automatically.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.540]   I mean, look at Apple again.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.540]   Oh, I can.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.300]   But on the other hand, you know, Devorak taught me this.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.780]   Because I would say, John, you hated this three seconds ago.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:29.700]   Now you love it.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.340]   He said, Leo, foolish consistency
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.020]   is the hob-boblin of small minds.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.340]   That's a good one.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.380]   He also didn't he used to review software
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.860]   with just looking at the box?
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.540]   Poor John.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.820]   I was the guy who said it.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.980]   John never denied it, but it's true.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.460]   It's true.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.580]   Just look at the box.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.540]   You know, he's kind of right.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.540]   Sometimes you can tell.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.220]   He must be very sad than there is no box anymore.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.220]   Yeah, there's no box anymore.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.300]   I want to talk about what's going on with Facebook.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.300]   F8 is coming up.
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.060]   I think Alexia, you're already starting
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.380]   to kind of feel the drum beat.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.300]   And Facebook did add a huge feature ahead of F8,
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.980]   the subscribe button.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.460]   And it strikes me.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.900]   And again, maybe you guys could talk me out of it.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.740]   The Facebook is really starting to lose its way here.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.860]   But let's take a break.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.860]   And we'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.300]   A great panel with us from Fox and Friends, Clayton Morris.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.220]   So nice to see you in the sauna today.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:27.740]   God.
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.580]   Get in dress.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.180]   He's really, really--
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.180]   You're in this break.
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.340]   Would you mind just taking off--
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:32.900]   I'm not wearing pants.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.940]   Just take off your shirt.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.540]   Take off your shirt every five minutes.
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.260]   A little bit more every time.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.820]   Alexia, so this is here from techcrunch.com,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.220]   Loiklemer, from LoWeb.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.180]   We're going to be at LoWeb.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:43.820]   I'm really excited.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.580]   LoWeb is December 7th, 8th, 9th.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:46.540]   Yes, 789.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.420]   In Paris.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   In Paris, 3,000 people.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.980]   That was tough for me to say we've
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.780]   bought the wine today.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.220]   And 16 countries coming.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.420]   It is such a great--
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.500]   You don't need to learn French.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.660]   That's what's amazing.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:01.740]   So my sense of it was it's a conference for entrepreneurs
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.020]   and startups in France.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.140]   But you bring a lot of Americans and other European
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.780]   entrepreneurs together to talk about it.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.580]   It's only a third French.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.140]   So it's actually a world event.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.300]   60 countries coming.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.700]   It's going to be so much fun.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.900]   We're going to have a booth there.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.300]   You don't know.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.140]   You don't have a booth.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.940]   You have your own studio.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.860]   You're going to have a studio.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.900]   It's not as big as the studio.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.780]   But we're building you a studio in the center.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.500]   And you're going to just do a Tweet
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.580]   and interview whomever you want.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.140]   It's going to be really, really cool.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.340]   Tweet goes to Paris.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.340]   Tweet goes to Paris.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.460]   I can't wait.
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.980]   So Sarah Lane and I will be there broadcasting
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.780]   the seventh, eighth, and ninth from the web.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.100]   And what's cool is you bring in so many interesting people.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.580]   We'll get a chance to talk to all of us.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.020]   I'll be there.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.620]   And Alexia will be there also.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:44.060]   That's great.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:44.540]   That's great.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.380]   You can do it.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.780]   I would love to.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.180]   You want to go?
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.820]   What we try to bring is all the cool stuff.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.460]   The theme is social local mobile.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.260]   So we're bringing Fleaboard.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.660]   Mike McCue is coming.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.140]   We're bringing Instagram.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.020]   We're bringing 955.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.060]   You heard this app that just launched this week, which
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.540]   is amazing Band of the Day.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.500]   Is that the name, Alexia?
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.660]   You read the crunch, right?
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.020]   Band of the day.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:09.780]   It's amazing.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.300]   500 stars.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.180]   I don't know what that is.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:11.700]   Company.
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.260]   Oh, you want to know what that is?
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.260]   Well, yeah.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:14.260]   Good.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.260]   Next time.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.260]   Oh, next time.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.260]   Come to the web.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.260]   Come to the web.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.220]   It should be a lot of fun.
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.660]   Will Mike be there?
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.820]   Mike will be there.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.500]   And he will even do more.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.300]   He asked me, you know, let's do more.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.420]   Because there's no tech crunch.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.620]   So he's completely free.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.860]   So yes, he will have a classic Marissa Meyer, Mike Arrington.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.020]   Every year we do this.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.100]   That's an amazing interview, I think that's that.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.100]   I'll tell you.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.500]   I don't know how you get Marissa each year to agree to that.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.660]   She got engaged in Paris.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:41.660]   I know, she loved it.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.340]   In fact, you can't move the day of the web.
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.060]   Because we don't move the web because she got engaged at the web.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.700]   So it's part of a celebration.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.900]   And every year, Louis Gasp people to get engaged.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   He starts from now.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.900]   He's like, you engaged?
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.900]   Yeah, engaged.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.380]   Yeah, I'm a speaker.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.620]   And every year, there's someone getting engaged at the web,
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.260]   absolutely.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:00.820]   Wow.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.660]   Well, Paris is very romantic, even in December, which is not
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.140]   the best time of year to go to Paris.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.140]   I got to tell you.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:06.660]   Oh, cool.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.140]   Jeff, come on.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.340]   It was freezing cold, I have to say.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.340]   It's snowed.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.180]   It's snowed, yeah.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.020]   We didn't expect that it happens.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.020]   Oh, I know these guys.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.260]   It happens every year.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:20.060]   Why did you use the picture where my left arm is missing?
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:20.420]   I don't know.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:20.860]   We'll fix this.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:21.820]   That's what the future is.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.140]   I never understood that picture.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.900]   It's a phyllibine of Evernote.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:25.540]   So you know the cold--
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   The cold is so fresh.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.540]   I love film, mobile apps.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:32.460]   I see Jeremiah Oyeong is there.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   Robert Scobel.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.500]   Like a Gabe's picture.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.580]   Yeah, Gabe Scobel.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.020]   Gabe Scobel.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.260]   Gabor Feref, TechMean.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.340]   What is he wearing?
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.460]   A BP shirt?
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.740]   And he's holding a bottle of Worcestershire sauce.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.300]   And Gabe just asked if--
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.380]   great episode so far.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.860]   Can we just mention TechMean 12 more time?
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.100]   Yes.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.020]   TechMean-- I don't know why more people don't read TechMean,
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:53.860]   actually.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.300]   It's like my home page.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.300]   Yeah, me too.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.260]   That's the first thing I go to in the morning to see.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.420]   I guess because it's kind of inside, you know, it's a--
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:00.980]   oh, wait a minute.
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.340]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.660]   Go back to that.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.980]   What are you wearing, a crown?
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:05.980]   Yes.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.060]   That's my original-- yes, crown.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.660]   Because I'm a princess of tech.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.700]   That's my original Twitter picture.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.220]   That's hysterical.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.100]   And it's also the logo of the fake Alexia Totsis on Twitter.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.180]   Can we have you on stage like vce this year?
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:18.660]   With a crown.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.460]   I will wear a crown.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.460]   I will engage.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.940]   A week war in Angry Birds outfit last year.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.940]   That was a circle.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.940]   Yes.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.660]   We had one of the founders of Angry Birds.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.660]   Anyway, we're looking forward to it.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.860]   Are you getting engaged vce here, right?
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.300]   I will never get engaged.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.540]   Oh.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.300]   I will be single and barren for the rest of my life.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.300]   Oh my god.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:37.820]   Wow.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.820]   My god.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.020]   We get so warm first.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.540]   You're a sea player.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.820]   And David Prager also with us from Revision 3.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.340]   What's the latest at Revision 3?
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.460]   Ah, we're having a good time.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:47.980]   We've been launching a few shows.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.820]   We got another one launching August 29th.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:51.940]   Did you make a pivot?
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.140]   Did you kind of go from being a creator of programming
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.980]   to a aggregator of programming?
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.940]   I think we do both.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.820]   I think we knew that as the environment
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:06.260]   around a lot of authentic individuals creating content
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.620]   started to proliferate more.
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.780]   There's so many people like Hack 5.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.460]   Exactly.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.020]   You've got that crazy Montreal food--
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.100]   Yeah, epic meal time.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.020]   Epic meal time.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.900]   I'm like making a bottle in a big, big, big, big way.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.420]   Holy cow.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.700]   But then the next one we're launching
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.620]   was with a guy named Ty Moss.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:23.620]   He's been running a show on YouTube called Ty's iPhone Help.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.740]   And he's got about 170 or so thousand subscribers.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.580]   Wow.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.060]   And so he's rebranding a tiny bit.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.740]   We're just going to change the name to Ty's iHelp.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.780]   So it's not just iPhone.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.540]   And we're launching that on the 29th of this month.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.220]   I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.300]   So yeah, we do a-- we have a kind of a programming development
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.740]   team, which kind of looks at creating our own stuff,
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.540]   works at partnering with others that don't have content
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.300]   but have an audience.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.780]   And then going out and finding people who do have an audience
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.980]   that we might be able to add some synergy to.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:49.980]   That seems to be the thing.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.620]   YouTube's doing that as well.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.340]   YouTube's-- yeah.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.940]   YouTube is all into building channels.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.220]   That's why they bought next new networks.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.420]   And I mean, it's kind of like curating content.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:46:59.920]   I guess.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:00.920]   Right.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:01.420]   Right.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.500]   And Alexia, we've already received three marriage
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   proposals on the chat room.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.500]   So--
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.000]   I do.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.300]   To all three of you.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:08.820]   Oh, I think--
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.320]   Whoa.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.620]   She just got engaged on Twitter.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.620]   It's not there anymore.
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.220]   No, I like.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:12.820]   Talk about it.
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.340]   Turn around.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   Turn around.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.660]   And out the window.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.620]   We're going to--
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.300]   When we come back, would you shut down the tablet, Louis?
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.900]   Because when we come back, we're going to show you how fast--
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:21.540]   I thought I'd question.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.060]   --windows eight boots.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.340]   Do you know that when we come back?
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.020]   You've got that dummy nitrix again,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.540]   book that you're going to read as an advertising?
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:29.140]   I might.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:29.940]   You never know.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.740]   You never know.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.380]   Remember that.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:32.100]   That's right.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.860]   No, I want to talk about Squarespace, actually.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:36.620]   The secret behind exceptional websites--
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.460]   we have a Squarespace site inside.twip.tv.
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.220]   That's fantastic.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.780]   Clayton just told you about his.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.540]   Squarespace is a really great company for hosting
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.380]   and software.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.020]   So you get the hosting--
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.980]   best hosting in the world.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.300]   They're using--
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:55.540]   it's a very sophisticated Java-based virtual server
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.380]   technology that means there's always bandwidth, no matter
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.100]   what you're doing.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.180]   We've never brought a Squarespace site down ever.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:06.020]   But it also is great content management software
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.420]   on top of that hosting.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.820]   And the reason you want to do that
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.500]   is because it's always up to date.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.300]   You're always running the latest version of the software.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.620]   You don't have to worry about security.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:18.380]   Trust me, this is the week where I wish I were on Squarespace.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.100]   We got hacked.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.260]   Our Drupal got hacked this week.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.740]   You don't have to worry about that.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.740]   Now, if you've got an existing blog, give it a try.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.540]   Just go to-- or if you want to do your first website
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.420]   or maybe you've got a new idea for a website--
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.580]   this is one of the things Squarespace is great for.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.220]   Got an idea?
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:33.820]   No problem.
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.420]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.540]   Click the "Try It Free" button right there.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:42.220]   All you need is the name of a site, a password, and an email.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.260]   And you, for 15 days, have full access to the Squarespace
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.260]   tools.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.460]   So you can really design a site from scratch at no cost to you.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.380]   And if you decide you want to keep going,
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.420]   it's very affordable.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.140]   Prices is low.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.460]   It's a little bit more than $10 a month.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.220]   Importing and exporting to all the major APIs,
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.780]   movable type, WordPress, Type Hat, and Blogger, Photo
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.300]   Galleries, point and click design.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.980]   They've got widgets for all the social tools,
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:11.380]   Twitter, and Facebook, and LinkedIn, and YouTube,
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:11.880]   and everything.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.620]   And it just really couldn't be easier to use.
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.140]   Here's the deal.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.180]   After you've tried it for free, if you decide
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.820]   you want to keep that site going,
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.180]   pricing very affordable.

[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.140]   for the first six years--
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.700]   I'm sorry, six months.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.940]   I didn't mean to extend it that long.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.780]   For six years.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:33.700]   For six--
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.580]   You know, in six months, that's plenty.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.100]   So if you can subscribe monthly, yearly, or two years,
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.700]   and you see they have different plans,
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.260]   but just check it out for free right now.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.020]   So wear space.com, click that green try and free button.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.500]   It's the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.300]   And actually, just go to the examples page
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.940]   if you want to see-- there it is.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.700]   That's our inside TWIT blog.
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.420]   That's a video I made with a new app that's
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.180]   from the harmonics people on the iPad.
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.260]   Have you seen Vidrythm yet, Clayton?
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.140]   It's so cool.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.260]   No, I haven't.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.820]   Should I just play a little bit of this video?
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.260]   I'll just play it.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:16.620]   So the idea is you record on the iPad,
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.380]   you record little-- you got audio in there?
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.300]   No, it's not coming in.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.380]   All right, I can play it over here.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.300]   You record a little bit, like it says, OK, record boom,
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.420]   or chick, or a word.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.780]   And then it assembles a video.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.460]   It's like auto-tune bit for sound effects?
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.540]   Yeah, it's hard to describe, but it's so cool.
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.580]   Do you have audio on my--
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.580]   Yep, I do.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.540]   All right, let's--
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:42.340]   this is, by the way, not Squarespace being slow coming up.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.740]   This is YouTube being slow coming up.
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:45.700]   Hello, YouTube.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.220]   See, Squarespace is faster than YouTube.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.420]   All right, screw up.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:49.900]   We'll do it.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.820]   We'll do it another time.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:51.500]   Squarespace.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.100]   I don't run it, but they should have--
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.100]   There it is.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:56.100]   I'm going to see a picture.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.860]   That's the audio.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:00.380]   There it is.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.100]   It's really-- it took about 30 seconds just to record
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:12.820]   those little things, and then it assembles it.
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:16.060]   Siliest program ever, vid rhythm.
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.340]   OK, that's more than enough.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.900]   Thank you.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.980]   Thank you, squarespace.com.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.660]   That's nothing to do with that video.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.500]   All right, so you shut this down.
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.060]   I think I did.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.620]   It's dead, dead, dead.
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.540]   OK.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.340]   And then you got a shot here.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.180]   We got to have the shot because it takes so little time.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:39.980]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:40.300]   Ready?
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:40.820]   Ready?
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:41.300]   OK.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.420]   And three, two, one.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.500]   There it goes.
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.860]   1,000, 1,000, 2, 1,000, 3.
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:51.220]   There's the Samsung, 1,000, 4, 1,000, 5, 1,000, 6, 1,000, 7.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.460]   I'm slowing down 1,000, 8.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.100]   It was faster than this last time I did.
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.820]   It's 1,000, 9, 1,000, 10.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:57.820]   There you go.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:58.300]   That's it.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:58.820]   There you go.
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.300]   That's it.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.660]   I think the MacBook Air takes 11 seconds or like 10 and 1/2 seconds.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.020]   So all the state drives are great.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:05.940]   I have to say--
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.140]   I think the iPad takes like 40 seconds to boot.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.620]   The iPad's much slower.
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:10.620]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:12.340]   Of course, who shuts down any of this?
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.220]   Yeah, no one shuts down the iPad, right?
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.540]   Yeah, until you get a lot of apps crashing, you realize.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.780]   Lately, I've had actually a lot of force
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.580]   clothes on the iPad.
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.020]   Facebook, let's talk a little bit about it.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.380]   They added this week.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.540]   They added a subscribe button, which is kind of confusing.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.340]   So now on Facebook, you have your personal page,
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.380]   which has a limit of 5,000 friends.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.300]   It's synchronous.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:38.300]   So somebody can't be your friend unless they ask and you say yes.
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.300]   There's also fan pages where it's asynchronous.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.460]   Anybody can be your follower, and there's no limit.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:49.140]   So I have Facebook.com/theleo-loport, which is all I could get,
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.540]   as a fan page, right?
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.220]   So this is kind of the official page.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.380]   And anybody can like that page.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.140]   Then I have Facebook.com/leo-g-loport.
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.460]   That's my personal page.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.860]   Well, now they've added a subscribe feature, which
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.700]   you can turn on.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.340]   In fact, if I go to my Facebook page,
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:08.140]   you'll see it even starts to recommend people
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:12.660]   I should subscribe to in the right-hand column here.
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.380]   So they don't have to become friends.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.140]   They just get to try.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.540]   They follow me.
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.020]   Yeah, and it shows up in--
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.140]   Exactly.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:19.700]   It says the opinion.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.860]   It's exactly like Twitter, right?
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.820]   It's Twitter.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:23.820]   But if you're a public figure, you
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.380]   can have a public figure account, your personal account.
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:27.780]   And what they're trying to do is
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.100]   create the ability for people who have public figure
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.420]   accounts to merge them with their private accounts
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.380]   and make it so-- and they can take all those people that
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.660]   are subscribed to their public figure accounts
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.900]   and make it so that they can just manage that within their main
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.260]   account and those people that are fans of their public figure
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.580]   profile phone only the--
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.100]   Thank you for explaining that, David.
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:45.580]   That was--
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.100]   That was so clear.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.940]   And I understand that.
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.620]   It's not that confusingly, though.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.140]   It's totally confusing.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:52.780]   You get this?
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.500]   You let Facebook--
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:55.020]   You name it.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.140]   I hate Facebook.
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.140]   OK.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.100]   OK, so you have subscribers on your page.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:00.940]   Yes, I do.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.140]   And so whatever you've set to public,
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.780]   these people are following.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:05.180]   Right.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.980]   And so when I post on my Facebook personal page,
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.220]   I can make it public.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.060]   And then these people--
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.780]   Now you get rid of your Facebook page.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.340]   That's a point.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.340]   You can read your fan page.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.700]   You get rid of the public figure.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.580]   No, no, no, wait a minute.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.300]   How do I get rid of my--
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.700]   So here's what page.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.420]   Is there an automatic way to do that?
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:24.820]   Here's what God is saying.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:25.740]   Zuckerberg.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:26.700]   Right.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.100]   So here's my fan page.
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.180]   What do I do?
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.540]   He killed his page, and he moved all his fans into subscribe.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:37.180]   So I'm going to tell these 4,125 people what?
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:37.700]   No.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.780]   You tell Facebook.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.100]   You tell them nothing.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.220]   You just disappear.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.380]   No, you ask Facebook.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.380]   You find a friend there.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.740]   Do you know what is Facebook as Leo?
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:45.220]   And--
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.380]   Use Facebook as Leo.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:46.820]   No, no, no, no.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:47.260]   What happened then?
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:47.900]   That switches.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:48.420]   No.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.180]   That's two accounts.
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:49.700]   That's something else.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.140]   Use Facebook as Leo.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.460]   You know, I got to tell you something.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.140]   Take the tour.
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.740]   This is so freaking confusing.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.380]   And I have to say, I think Facebook is making a huge mistake.
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.620]   Now, we'll see what they're doing,
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.100]   and I want to know what they're going to do at F8.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.780]   You probably know already, Alexia.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.580]   But it strikes me that Facebook, in an attempt to keep up
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:07.860]   with Twitter--
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.100]   Please, Twitter, and friend, and people.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.620]   --and people.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.220]   So guys, do you think you've dumped 5 million?
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.060]   No.
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.060]   How is that a good policy?
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:17.100]   I've moved them as subscribers.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.100]   So how do you do it?
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:18.300]   I have--
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.260]   But wait a minute.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:22.500]   Coca-Cola and others' brands have spent millions of dollars
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.100]   getting people to push the like button.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:24.940]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:25.780]   For individuals.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.380]   For you.
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:30.260]   So they want brands to use pages and individuals to use--
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:30.820]   Yes.
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:31.820]   So they're very cool.
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.140]   So they're however fans to your subscriber followers.
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.180]   But what about Lady Gaga?
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.100]   Is that a brand or is that a person?
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:38.580]   That's a good--
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.580]   Nah, that's a good person.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.580]   That's a good person.
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.500]   But you lose analytics.
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.660]   So if you go ahead and you move that over, you lose all--
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.580]   Precisely.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:46.740]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.780]   You know, it's one thing to--
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:48.620]   No, look at this.
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:49.780]   When I look at my--
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:53.860]   When I look at my click here, I see how many impressions.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.620]   I see the percent of feedback on here on every--
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.300]   All of that goes away.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.780]   All of that goes away.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.380]   All of that goes away if you move it over with the subscribe.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.780]   So therefore, I don't know--
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.020]   I mean, unless they move and they're
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:08.060]   able to migrate the analytics over to the subscribe
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.780]   functionality for fan pages, then it's worthless.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.100]   It's worthless to me.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.860]   I mean, I think like a couple of years ago,
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.780]   I hit on my personal page and just stupidly accepted--
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.100]   you know, just said ad friend, whatever,
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.740]   and just kept accepting folks who had asked.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.060]   And then I hit my limit on my personal page.
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.780]   And it's impossible now to clean it up.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.020]   I just assume delete the thing.
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.260]   But that's what I ended up doing.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.100]   That's what I ended up doing.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.180]   I think you won't get any result on Facebook
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.780]   because you're just cross-busting from Twitter
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.780]   and that they know that.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.180]   So they won't help you.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.700]   Can I just say, this is what Facebook should do?
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.260]   Submit it.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.820]   And you guys tell me I'm wrong.
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.380]   Submit it.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:43.780]   Here's what Facebook should do.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.300]   They should stop all this crap.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.220]   Why do people want-- why-- who uses Facebook?
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.500]   Ignorant people don't know anything about the internet.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.700]   This is how they keep track of their friends and family.
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.860]   Normal people, not ignorant, but just people
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:56.940]   who are not interested.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.260]   Normal people, they want privacy.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.540]   They want to know what mom did.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.540]   They want to know what their college roommate did.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.820]   They don't want all this complicated stuff.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.580]   It's way too confusing.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.660]   Facebook should stop adding all these crazy features
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:11.940]   and just focus on what brought them to the table.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.140]   I think part of what you're making--
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.860]   getting people a reaction to Google+ in circles.
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.140]   Because it is.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.620]   Because if you look at people--
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:20.380]   if you're accepting friends now, you'll see that.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.260]   And it is confusing.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:24.220]   I understand that they feel pressure from Twitter and Google
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:24.740]   Plus.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.740]   High school friends, college friends,
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.060]   they're making a huge mistake.
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:28.140]   They want you to be able to catch that.
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.060]   That's another thing they've done.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:29.700]   They've made lists.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:31.260]   So now when I post on Facebook--
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.740]   And I think they want you to be open.
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:33.700]   People to be open.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.620]   People were afraid to be open.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.980]   So they say, oh, well, we'll be able to let you
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.620]   privatize different things in different ways
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.940]   so that you can say more about it.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.500]   And also, Twitter is inherently open.
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:43.020]   Look at this.
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.260]   So there's a problem with Facebook
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.940]   started as private and Twitter started as open.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:47.180]   Does this remind you of Google+?
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.180]   Now when I post, I can say post to people
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.980]   who went to my high school, people live in my area.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:53.620]   People work at Twitter, people who went to my college.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:58.900]   They've made all of these lists into who I post.
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.620]   This is totally Google+.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.140]   Facebook, this doesn't make people feel better.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.980]   This confuses people.
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:05.820]   It is a mess.
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:06.860]   It is an absolute mess.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:07.820]   It's a mess.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.300]   I've got--
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.260]   I have a couple of fan pages for different--
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:13.060]   for our different shows, like Daddy On Board,
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:13.700]   these other shows.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:15.020]   And I can't-- I mean, it's just a mess.
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:16.900]   Trying to manage all of them where this goes.
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.900]   Use Facebook as a page makes no sense.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.020]   Sometimes when I'm using the mobile version of this,
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.060]   I'm not that person.
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.300]   I'm the other page.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.020]   And I'm posting as this other page.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:27.900]   It makes no sense.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.580]   And why are you still using it?
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:30.460]   Because you have to.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:31.580]   Because you have to, exactly.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:32.060]   So--
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.060]   Exactly.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.420]   No, it's--
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:36.740]   First of all, I do guys have reversed the John Battelle
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.620]   article searches a pencil.
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.740]   He was arguing that Facebook's like Photoshop.
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:42.660]   And Twitter is like a pencil.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.100]   And you use-- like you use Twitter just--
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.740]   it's simple and you use Twitter just to post a status update.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:49.940]   But if you need to use Photoshop, you need to use--
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:51.460]   That's so silo color variation.
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:51.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.740]   There are 500 million people using Facebook.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.940]   And they don't know about Twitter.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:56.660]   7 million.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.660]   7 million.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.180]   And some of the chaters said you're not using it
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:58:59.940]   like normal people.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:00.900]   No, no, I agree.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.860]   But that's what I'm saying is normal--
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:06.380]   if normal people don't want all this stuff,
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:08.780]   all of these things that they're putting on Facebook
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:11.380]   are ways for them to try to make money.
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.900]   They're throwing stuff up against the wall.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.460]   They don't understand.
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.900]   They have no vision in this.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:16.300]   And there's no central corporate--
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.220]   When posting something in there.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.020]   And they're screwing the hell out of it in a year.
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.020]   This is going to be gone.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:20.940]   They've totally got vision.
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:23.900]   They made $3 billion in 2011.
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:24.900]   What?
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.940]   700 million of that was--
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:28.220]   But that's history.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:28.700]   That's profit.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.300]   That's history.
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:29.980]   Right.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.620]   But then that was certainly--
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.900]   they were out-- well, maybe not out in front.
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.180]   Obviously, MySpace was out in front.
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.500]   But I think to Delio's point, I look at somebody
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.700]   like my mom who loves Facebook.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.260]   She's able to connect with my body.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.300]   That's Facebook's body.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.620]   Make mom happy.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:45.460]   Well, not only do--
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.860]   But they're not because there are certain functionalities
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:48.900]   that are public.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.420]   And so when you add public and then subscribe,
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.380]   most of the defaults are already there.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.460]   So no one would need to subscribe because they're already
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.940]   getting everything if they just go to her feed anyway.
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.300]   So now if she sets certain things to private,
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.100]   then that's where subscribe would be valuable because then
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.300]   I could subscribe and not get all the private stuff.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.100]   But she doesn't know that.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.540]   I mean, it really is.
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:09.620]   You need to read like three books
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.740]   to know all the functionality of Facebook.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.380]   It is in that respect very much like Photoshop.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.980]   But they're aiming, it's for Photoshop for mom.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.260]   It does look like a huge--
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.660]   Mom's not a problem for Facebook.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.900]   My 14-year-old here, he knows nothing else in Facebook.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.260]   And he loves what we're saying because he doesn't use
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.140]   anything else.
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.340]   When you talk to him about Twitter,
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.860]   he doesn't know why he would use Twitter.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.380]   Right.
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.180]   And so it's not for months, that for sure.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.780]   Did you see how they combined email in my mind,
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.260]   they combined email with IM conversations.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.860]   There was another crazy thing.
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.460]   Oh, that's what it's totally like.
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.700]   It's basically like a combination of email
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.500]   and IM conversations.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.140]   When Messenger came out, when you do a Facebook--
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.420]   Facebook came out, it basically pops up--
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:45.780]   Every day.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.460]   --on your screen immediately.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.340]   Really?
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:48.780]   Well, but--
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.860]   Now, I used to use Facebook occasionally with people
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.020]   as email as soon as Messenger came out.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.260]   I mean, it's right in front of your face in half a second.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.620]   The only good thing about that in a way
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.900]   is that you deal with it and it's done.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.100]   So you're consistently at inbox zero.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:00.740]   I think this is--
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.380]   This is free.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.300]   I mean, Messenger's replaced texting for me
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.060]   in the most part.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.500]   This is over-complicated.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.460]   This is what they did with Blue Girl.
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.260]   So who's 14?
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.260]   Is that your son?
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.100]   Yes.
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.980]   And you use this all the time.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.860]   Do you feel like you understand Facebook exactly how it works?
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.140]   It all makes perfect sense to you.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:18.740]   Come over here.
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:19.180]   Come over here.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.020]   We've got to come over here.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:20.020]   Come here.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.020]   Come here.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:21.860]   Take my thing.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.660]   Let's get a real Facebook user.
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.500]   I'll get his mind, but--
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.940]   Explain why you don't know anything else.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.220]   Tell me why Facebook is the thing.
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.620]   What's your name?
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.380]   Gochie.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.580]   Gochie, nice to meet you.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:38.700]   Lean right into that microphone.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.460]   So tell me-- you don't have to leave low-eak.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.980]   You want the younger generation to take over?
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   His roof feeling is way good.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.980]   No, you get me some roof here.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.420]   So Gochie, yeah, get some more roof here for a Lexus.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.460]   A roof here, maybe some water.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.340]   Take yourself useful.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.820]   Other chips.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.700]   So Gochie, you use Facebook all the time.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.180]   You're every day.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.380]   You spend hours on it.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:56.860]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.380]   What do you like about it?
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.460]   I'll usually the chat.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.260]   And it's your friends that are on there, right?
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.300]   Yeah, mostly.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:09.300]   Do you follow a lot of brand pages on there?
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.140]   Well, I'm not really interested in following people.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.980]   Yeah, so you don't subscribe.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.700]   You don't like pages.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.340]   If I go to your Facebook account, you won't see--
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.340]   Gochie likes Nike shoes and likes Coca-Cola and all.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:26.700]   Well, I have some pages I like, but I just did that.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.660]   Usually it's my friends who like those pages.
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.460]   And then I just see that and like him too.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.620]   You don't interact with the brands or anything like that.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.140]   No.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.460]   He doesn't email him.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.300]   Do you use email?
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.100]   You use Facebook Messenger now?
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.020]   Yeah, it's mostly Facebook message.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:44.500]   And otherwise, sometimes email, but less.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.820]   So you use Facebook because that's
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.100]   where your friends hang out.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.820]   It's the best way to stay in touch with your friends,
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:51.820]   see what they're doing, share pictures with them.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.220]   And you find it very easy to use.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.740]   Do you see a lot of features there that you don't use?
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:01.740]   Well, the only feature I use is the friend part of it.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.300]   So otherwise--
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:03.800]   Right.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.300]   But do you--
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.260]   So kind of what I'm saying--
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.140]   So kind of what I'm saying--
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.500]   Do you have friends, family--
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.420]   Do you do lists?
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.700]   Different like really good friends versus not so good
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:11.060]   friends?
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.700]   Do you do that?
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.340]   Not really.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.220]   I only had my actual friends.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.060]   And to be honest, I don't have any member of my family
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.420]   in my friends.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.740]   Do you keep your privacy settings pretty stringent?
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.260]   I know--
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.940]   Kids aren't allowed to be public.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.540]   So they're not a part of the subscribe feature
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.980]   because they're not allowed to have public--
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.620]   You can't allow subscribe.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:33.100]   But in your account set, do you look at the privacy settings
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.820]   and look at those settings and mess with them?
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:37.340]   Do you?
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:38.700]   Yeah, but everything in private.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.180]   You just make it private.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.620]   You're not a common reframe.
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:44.260]   Do you use Google+ or any of your friends on Google+ at all?
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.260]   They're not allowed to.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:45.780]   Twitter.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.580]   It's an eight requirements again.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.340]   But--
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:48.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:52.140]   So this is kind of my position is that Goce is exactly
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.420]   who Facebook should be serving.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.860]   Unfortunately, Facebook's trying to make a killing
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:03:59.500]   in the market.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.620]   But I think by doing so, they're going to make themselves
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.420]   less appealing to Goce and his friends.
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.180]   Because really, you use it in a very simple and I think
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.380]   in a very effective way.
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.740]   It's how you message people.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.020]   It's how you look at their pictures,
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.460]   see what they're up to.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.700]   You do stuff on the wall.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.940]   Now, one of the things you're going to add this week is music.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:20.300]   If you had Rhapsody or some music service in there,
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.260]   would you kind of have that going in the background?
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.740]   Well, what do you mean, like using Facebook as--
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:29.860]   Do you happen to use RDO or Spotify or any of those?
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.380]   Return to--
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.820]   How do you listen to music, Goce?
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.300]   iTunes only.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.860]   Just iTunes playing in the background?
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.780]   Do you know what ping is?
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.500]   Do you use it?
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.020]   No.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020]   Of course not.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.020]   I just have my library.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.260]   Do you use Skype on Facebook?
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.500]   Do you ever video chat with people on Facebook?
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.740]   Not on Facebook, but I use a lot of Skype
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.420]   just as an application.
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.660]   You know that Skype is built into Facebook?
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:54.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.420]   I know.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:55.980]   They just--
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.940]   But you don't use it?
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.620]   No.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.540]   I think he's just underscoring my point,
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.340]   which is that there's a core set of features
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.300]   that they should focus on, make easier to use,
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:11.540]   serve this audience better, and not start adding all this--
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.380]   look at this cross--
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.420]   I got a question for you.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.140]   Are you going to-- would you listen to music through Facebook?
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.220]   Like if you-- if instead of iTunes,
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:22.340]   if there were a radio station and it would say, hey, Goce,
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.340]   your friends are listening.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:26.700]   Right now, they're listening to LMFAO.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.780]   Would you then like kind of listen to it?
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.100]   You think I'll tell them.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:30.900]   I'm so mad.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.420]   I'm so mad.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.500]   I'm so mad.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.260]   You are.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:37.460]   I-- it depends if I don't know the music.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.500]   Otherwise, if I have it on my library, iTunes library,
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:41.860]   I would--
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.860]   You'd probably just keep iTunes running all the time, right?
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:44.820]   There's always music going.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.660]   It's just iTunes.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.260]   So I'm thinking of a turntable right now,
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:51.340]   because turntable is for listening,
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.620]   creating playlists with your friends.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.740]   Do you know what turntable FM is?
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:55.260]   No.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:55.860]   No.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.700]   See, I think we live in a completely different space
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:05:59.820]   from normal users.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.500]   And I think that Goce is a normal user.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.020]   And I mean--
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:04.980]   OK, thank you, Goce.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.980]   I appreciate your being a guinea pig for us.
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.460]   You did a great job.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:09.740]   Very good job.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.340]   Louis, where's my root beer?
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:13.540]   We'll get you a root beer.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.300]   Can somebody get--
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.740]   Oh, yes, Ms. Toss is--
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:16.460]   No, no, you stay.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.860]   You're a panelist.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.260]   We have people.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.460]   John or somebody, would you give them a root beer for--
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:21.980]   Oh, whoa, whoa.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:22.980]   There you go.
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.060]   I'm going to ask my sauna boyfriend a bit beer.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.620]   Sauna boy, towel.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.020]   Oh, sauna boy.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:28.820]   Sauna boy.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:29.820]   Sauna, tweter, no googles.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:33.100]   So do you assume what I'm saying is that I think Goce doesn't need
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.660]   all this fancy elaborate stuff?
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.660]   No, I agree.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:36.540]   And I think it just--
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.260]   no, it maybe isn't getting in his way,
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.580]   but I don't think it serves Facebook to be adding all these
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.100]   features.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.380]   No, I get what you're saying.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:42.940]   Totally.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:43.820]   I think it's an age thing.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:44.740]   I think it's an age thing.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:45.180]   It's an age thing.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:47.820]   I mean, Goce doesn't hate Facebook
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.220]   because it's a utility.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.620]   For me, I don't love Facebook, but I don't find it that offensive.
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.740]   I wish it would do something with events.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.260]   Like, it's got so much--
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:57.980]   It has events.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.860]   It has events, but it doesn't.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:01.020]   I've been invited to Als Cardino's yard sale.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.220]   They're pretty disorganized.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.060]   It's going on right now.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.700]   The mobile UI is kind of terrible.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.380]   It doesn't let you click into the addresses.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.620]   I mean, there's such a huge market.
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:07.620]   Oh, come on.
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.140]   The UI is terrible all around.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:09.740]   All around.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.460]   I think it's awful.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.300]   I'm with Patel on the Photoshop.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.420]   I think that Facebook needs to do what Leo says
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.780]   is make sure that the capabilities and the functionality
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:18.900]   of people like remain the same and people can use that.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.980]   But at the same time, they need to look
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.620]   at what other people in their space that are competitors
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.060]   are doing and make sure that they innovate, react to them,
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.940]   and maybe iterate what they're doing better.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.380]   And come up with new ideas because otherwise--
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.940]   Well, that's clearly what they're doing.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.060]   That's clearly what they're doing.
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.900]   I mean, this subscribe is a direct response
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.780]   to Twitter and Google+.
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:39.780]   What else-- Alexis, you know what else they're
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.300]   going to be doing at F8?
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.460]   Music, right?
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.380]   Alexia, sorry.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.220]   Music.
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.020]   I keep thinking of Ariana's taslumopolis.
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.340]   And I want to call you Ariana.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.940]   Someone call me a young Ariana.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.100]   Ariana, darling.
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.540]   What are they going to be?
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.940]   What is a face we're going to be doing?
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:55.940]   I don't think music.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.940]   I'm not.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:59.340]   I'm really sure on specific--
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.940]   I mean, I think you've announced a lot of stuff.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.940]   --of the project.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:04.740]   Blue, they've had their iPad app around for a while.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.260]   That's right.
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.540]   And they might announce that.
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:08.060]   That's right.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.900]   There's a switch on Facebook that says,
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:11.420]   if you're coming in from TechCrunch,
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.820]   you can't see what they're doing, isn't there?
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.820]   I tend to think that they don't update fast enough
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.020]   on my Facebook.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:18.540]   It's you?
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.060]   I don't--
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.940]   That might be a little paranoia.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.300]   I also think that Facebook's going
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.460]   to be making it so in the ability
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.980]   to have different kinds of feeds,
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.340]   you'll be able to have more immediate feeds,
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.580]   so things that people are doing at the moment.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.100]   So when the music comes out, you'll
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.660]   be able to have a feed of what's really happening right now
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:37.180]   and then have a feed of, I'm just going to catch up
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.540]   on what's been going on with my friends.
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.900]   I think they're going to focus on that, I think.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.940]   I think Facebook is in peril.
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.940]   And I think the risk to them right now
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:49.780]   is getting so complicated and convoluted
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:53.820]   that they can make it very difficult for the core users
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.780]   like Gucci and my mom.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.100]   You're sounding like Scoble.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.100]   Are you a big Google+ fan?
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.500]   I am.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.340]   Well, why does that make me sound like Scoble?
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:06.540]   It's like the friend feed of 2011.
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.300]   Yes, damn.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.220]   I love friend feed.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.060]   I love friend feed.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:09.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.900]   But so you're saying that Facebook is the be all
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:13.820]   and end all for you.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.020]   No, did I say that?
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.100]   It's what you love.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.540]   I love Twitter.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:20.260]   But I love Twitter because it's the use case
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.860]   that I'm most connected with.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.060]   I get to go on there and see news.
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.060]   Me too.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.340]   That's-- you're absolutely right.
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:29.900]   Well, we're all the big winners at TechCrunch
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.620]   based on different ways to do social interactions.
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:35.100]   And a lot of them as plug-ins to existing social networks
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:35.740]   like Facebook.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:40.220]   Well, a shaker was like a--
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.340]   somebody said a Habbo Hotel for Facebook.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.980]   Yeah, I was really surprised Shaker
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.340]   wanted to be honest with you.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.340]   I thought, yeah.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:47.820]   What the hell?
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:51.180]   We were doing Avatar Chat in 1998 on Tech TV.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.500]   It's Second Life.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.700]   Yeah, it is Second Life.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.340]   Except the first life, that's what they--
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.580]   I'm not going to defend it.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.380]   But so the reason people think this is a hot startup
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:04.020]   is because one word, Facebook, it's designed for Facebook.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:04.500]   So that makes it--
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.100]   Yeah, it's not color.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:09.660]   It makes it hot because it will be a plug-in for Facebook
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.540]   so that I'll have Avatar Chat in Facebook.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.500]   But it seems to me that there is a--
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.500]   Like Zinga.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.060]   Like Zinga.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:15.900]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.900]   Zinga doesn't let you leave a virtual life.
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.340]   I mean, it's fucker.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.700]   It lets you live--
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.260]   Are you kidding?
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.300]   Have you ever played Farmville?
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.500]   For two minutes.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.980]   That's a virtual life, isn't it?
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:27.460]   Yeah, no, I have--
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:28.380]   How are your pigs doing?
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:29.860]   Are they OK?
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.340]   When's the last time you harvested?
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:36.740]   I think people don't want to party as a virtual avatar
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.500]   by a virtual bar.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.420]   And that just seems totally wrong.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.020]   Yeah, you ask me 10 years ago.
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.380]   I'm telling you guys that people don't want to make
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.940]   raise virtual turnips and virtual page.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:48.860]   But people do.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.580]   People--
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:54.060]   It appeals to people to make these weird pixelated lives.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.500]   I don't get it at all.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.460]   But I actually don't have free time.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.380]   So that's one thing.
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:04.500]   So that's one thing to jump on Farmville and grow radishes
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:04.980]   or whatever.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.620]   But we saw the failure of color, the app, which
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.660]   was supposed to be social context, right?
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.100]   Those people around you you could share photos with.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.940]   You could have instant conversations.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:20.220]   To my mind, this is really like color inside of Facebook.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:21.420]   You could virtually meet.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:21.780]   Sure.
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.300]   I mean, it's second life in that way.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.980]   But it's still social with context, right?
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.940]   Have you used it?
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.620]   It's not-- color had a terrible UI.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.460]   The problem with color was no one understood how to get around
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.220]   it or what was happening.
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.900]   Well, also when they launched--
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:37.340]   When they launched, they didn't have user base of people
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:37.860]   near them.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.780]   I think they wanted to launch it south by southwest.
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:40.340]   They didn't get it on--
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.220]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:43.540]   And no one was able to use it with other people using it
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.220]   anywhere near them.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:45.980]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.220]   And that's not a story of color would have been different
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.820]   if it had launched at southwest.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:49.540]   They might have--
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.020]   I don't think it's a story would have been different.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.300]   I think that was a horrible startup.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.780]   Wasn't there one of the investors at Sequoia just--
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.660]   I heard about some article saying,
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.540]   I'm full support.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:11:59.980]   I can't wait.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.020]   This is really exciting.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:01.980]   You can't wait for the--
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:02.900]   You can't wait for the--
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:03.540]   For what?
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.060]   Stay tuned for the pivot.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.660]   The pivot.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.540]   Paltimin and ours.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.340]   I can pivot.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.020]   That's something that they're working on.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.020]   Paltimin.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.420]   No, they're working on a project called Blue.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:13.700]   And that's something that might get announced.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.580]   So maybe they could do every color in their rainbow.
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:18.140]   Red, green, blue, yellow in the go.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:23.780]   Let's move on, shall we?
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:27.780]   Sound, by the way, sound cloud, diesel, and rhapsody,
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.780]   according to this blog called TechCrunch,
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.540]   are the three music--
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:32.580]   Let's take her.
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.300]   I never heard of them.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.220]   Robert Waters writing.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:38.540]   And of course, Robin is looking at the source code.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:39.260]   I love it.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.620]   No, Robin isn't that one source code, Kai.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.100]   Oh, this is that guy.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.300]   Love him.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.140]   Yeah, that guy.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:47.540]   Yova--
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.300]   Yvos Shep.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.620]   Yvos Shep.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:56.540]   So he looked at the code and he found in the code
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:01.180]   Spotify, radio, MOG, SoundCloud, diesel, and rhapsody,
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.700]   all in here.
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.140]   I am a big Spotify fan.
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.300]   I'm trying to think if-- I think that there's potential
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.540]   there for Facebook data to be applied to Spotify
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.940]   to make it more interesting.
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.100]   And there it is, kind of.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:14.580]   Is it?
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.420]   It makes your social graph.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:15.860]   That's right.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:16.380]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.940]   My social graph comes from Facebook.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.220]   The only European startup, pretty truly global.
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:21.660]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.140]   It's a big success from your four ones.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.820]   Is it the only one?
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.380]   About C-Smic.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.460]   C-Smic is based in San Francisco.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.380]   San Francisco has an ink after its name,
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.700]   but we have a team there.
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:35.100]   But no, very Skype, too, that is all very often referred to.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.820]   But Skype was sold and resold.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:37.620]   Right.
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.140]   Yeah, very Skype, too.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.500]   But Spotify is--
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:41.060]   It's interesting.
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:41.580]   It's interesting.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.980]   Why is that there are no more successful European startups
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.820]   than just those?
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.260]   Because generally-- the main reason for me
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.660]   is generally the Europeans.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.580]   I'm going to make friends again.
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.900]   But I'm trying to be honest.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:58.100]   I have done that mistake, too, is when you're in Paris,
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.620]   you focus on France.
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:01.300]   Where in Germany, you focus on Germany?
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.220]   It's organized.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:02.700]   Right?
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.460]   So what happens is by the time you've
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.860]   been focusing on Germany, trying to own Germany or Spain,
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.660]   there is someone in Silicon Valley who
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.220]   raised more and has more success.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.900]   So YouTube versus a French called Daily Motion and so on.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.420]   That, to me, is the main reason.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.580]   We don't start in English.
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:20.180]   So the reason the band Phoenix is a big success.
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.380]   They're from France is because they sing in English.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.260]   I'm serious.
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:23.900]   That's bizarre.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:24.420]   But you have tons of--
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:25.980]   No, no, it's totally true.
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:28.340]   The DJs are all owned by French.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.060]   You know, David Gita.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:29.580]   Yeah.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.780]   Why don't you think that they're an amazing band?
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:33.340]   And I kind of realized one day that the reason that they're
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:36.380]   so huge is that they've got a potential audience
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.580]   of every English speaker on the planet versus every French
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:40.620]   speaker on the planet.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:41.860]   I'm going to just make sense.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:44.700]   It's a language of pop culture in English.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:45.660]   I'm using MCM.
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.380]   It's all-- MCM is the French MTV.
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.580]   And it's all English.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:52.380]   We're wearing some French rap.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:53.740]   So we're going to talk a little bit.
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.980]   Robert Scoble, you mentioned his name.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.180]   She'll not be named.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.180]   She'll not be named.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:02.340]   He says that there is a flip board killer coming
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.940]   from Google soon.
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:04.620]   Call Propeller.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.500]   We'll talk about that and more with our great panel.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.100]   Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends,
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.700]   Alexia Sosas from TechCrunch, Louis Clomer
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:15.820]   from Cismicand, lowweb.net.
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:18.540]   You got squatted on theweb.com.
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:19.860]   Actually, it's inaccurate.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:20.820]   It's inaccurate.
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:23.100]   The domain was registered before we launched.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:23.860]   Oh, OK.
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:25.940]   But they don't do anything with it, which
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:26.460]   misses me up.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.540]   They should give it to me.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.060]   Yeah, to me.
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:28.700]   Give it to me.
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.220]   They put like stupid ads.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.260]   That really upsets me.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:31.500]   I know.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:31.780]   I hate it.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.340]   I try to buy it and they don't even answer.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.060]   It's just squatting.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:36.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.060]   Olio.com was--
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:38.580]   Oh.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.340]   Oh, that sucks.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:43.180]   What are you laughing at?
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:43.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:44.660]   How about Lio La Porte?
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.420]   You have Lio La Porte.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.420]   No.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.340]   Somebody else has that too.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.100]   You need to learn from Facebook.
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.020]   I don't have even on Facebook.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.340]   I don't have Lio La Porte.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.940]   At least on lio.com, I can learn different language.
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:57.580]   You know what?
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:58.620]   It really hurts me.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.340]   See, it's the same.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.100]   We get to really--
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.260]   You know, really, you're Christian dating.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:05.860]   Lio.com had for years been owned by the Royal Bank of Canada
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.220]   because their mascot is a lion, is Lio the lion.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.940]   And so it was a beautiful RBC page.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.700]   So I just gave up.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.740]   I said, well, obviously, they'll never give that up.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:19.300]   And then about a year or two ago, they just stopped paying for it.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:22.220]   I should have been watching it and some clown got it.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.020]   I could have had that.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.420]   And they probably make a thousand months with that or something.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.660]   Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:27.860]   Have you contacted this guy?
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.780]   No, because that--
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.380]   How do you contact him?
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:32.220]   Because--
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.100]   Is he not on who?
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.380]   We tried it bounces.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.260]   Well, no, I understand that you could contact him.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:40.340]   But as soon as you contacted me, he goes, ah, I got a live one.
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:42.740]   So you have to contact him like, hi.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:45.300]   My name is Leo Dickinson.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:50.820]   And I would really like an email, lio.com.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.340]   Can I buy that for $10?
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:56.260]   But you know, he's not going to give it to me for $10.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:58.940]   How much is it worth to get lio.com?
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.660]   Oh, I would say $50K.
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.580]   Shut up.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:06.060]   How much did color by color dot com for $300K?
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.620]   That was more than $300K.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.460]   I know that--
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.420]   Sex.com was what's a million dollars.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.340]   I know that for dot LK domains, which is Sri Lanka,
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.900]   you have to appeal to the government.
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.100]   So I've heard.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.900]   And so when Kevin got milk, MI.LK, he just asked them for it
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:21.940]   and they got it at cost.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:22.900]   Wow.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.500]   So it's probably--
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.420]   But if you go to milk.com, though, the owner's like,
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.620]   you better be offering me double digit millions,
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.940]   or you don't even do buying.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:33.140]   I think a three-letter domain name like lio.com
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.300]   is going to be very difficult to get.
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:37.380]   But it's sad because this guy's not using it.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.140]   What's he doing with it?
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.020]   Nothing.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:40.620]   Let's take a break.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.060]   When we come back-- also David Prager's here from Revision 3.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:45.260]   I just want to introduce-- reintroduce everybody.
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.980]   When we come back-- yes, let's talk about the flip board clone
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.060]   if-- see if anybody knows anything about that.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.380]   But before I do that, I want to talk about audio books
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.580]   from audible.com.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.540]   I am a big, audible fan.
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:58.380]   I don't think I am telling you anything
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.260]   if you've ever watched me on any of these shows.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:03.580]   You know that I listen when I'm in the car, when I'm at the gym,
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.500]   when I'm cleaning house.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.660]   Audio books are great.
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:07.900]   And I highly recommend it.
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.660]   And I'm going to give you a chance to try it for free right
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:09.820]   now.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.420]   Get two books for free.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.700]   If you go to audible.com/twit2,
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.860]   you'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:17.820]   That's two books a month.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.300]   But the first month's free, first two books are free.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.620]   And other yours to keep canceled at any time.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.300]   Now, I think this is going to be one.
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.420]   Jane Lynch is hosting the Emmys tonight.
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:30.540]   She's, of course, the star, Sue Sylvester on Glee.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.940]   I didn't know she had a memoir.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.380]   Carol Burnett wrote the forward and helps narrate it.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:35.700]   Jane Lynch, happy accident.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.500]   So that's a good one.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.780]   Now, if you're in to show Biz memoirs--
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.420]   now, this is a tough one.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.940]   There's the Rob Lo book, Stories I Only Tell My Friends.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.100]   Man, that's probably pretty good.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.340]   Rob Lo narrates that one.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:51.940]   Or bossy pants, Tina Fey's new memoir, which
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:54.020]   is supposed to be very good.
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.540]   And also, Nere by Tina Fey.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:56.700]   So these are great.
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.500]   This is an example of Audible.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.780]   You hear these people, these great stars
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:03.900]   talking in your head to you, reading to you.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.020]   It's a wonderful way to get reading done
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.460]   when you just don't have time.
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.140]   If you're a little bit more literary,
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.820]   you want something a little bit more educational.
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:13.540]   How about this?
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:18.940]   Grand Pursuit, Sylvia Nasser wrote that fabulous book
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:22.020]   about a beautiful mind about the mathematician.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:24.700]   This is her new book about economics,
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:28.660]   called A Grand Pursuit, the Story of Economic Genius.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:32.180]   Thomas Friedman's new book is out on Audible.com.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.900]   That used to be us, how America fell behind in the world
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.300]   and embedded.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.100]   I just think this is such a great resource for education,
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:45.860]   for entertainment, science and technology, sci-fi and fantasy.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.580]   It's all here.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.380]   So pick two books.
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:52.740]   Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time, that'd be kind of nice.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.660]   Get smart while you're driving.
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.980]   Pick two books and make Audible yours.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:01.380]   Audible.com/twit to plays back on everything.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.660]   In fact, if you've got the new Kindle,
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.620]   it's great because your Audible books show up
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:08.020]   along with your Amazon books right there in the Kindle
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.900]   for you to download and listen to at any time.
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:13.820]   Audible.com/twit to-- Clayton, you're an Audible fan, I know.
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:14.340]   I love it.
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.540]   Yeah, we were just driving up here two hour drive listening
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:19.380]   to In Defense of Food by Michael Pollan.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:23.620]   That's the follow up to his Omnivores Dilemma book.
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:27.020]   I love the functionality on the Audible app on the iPhone.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.420]   Isn't that great?
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:31.060]   Because, yeah, you can pick which speed, the read rate.
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.580]   So if you want to-- I actually listened to, I think,
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:36.620]   in the Plex book about Google in triple speed.
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:37.620]   Do you really?
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.220]   And it depends on who's reading it, right?
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:44.020]   But I can get through a good book in that amount of time.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:44.820]   My wife can't stand it.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.140]   She's like, well, you just put it on the normal rate, please.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:47.940]   I'm not in a hurry.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:50.220]   I want to enjoy my books.
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.740]   You obviously want to get them over with.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.140]   I feel like there's so much knowledge.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.740]   As Miles gets older, you're going to love Audible for kids'
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.140]   books, too, by the way.
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.060]   And I read to my kid like crazy.
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.180]   I'm sure you will, too.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.340]   In fact, you probably already are.
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.340]   There's nothing more pleasant than reading to your kid in bed.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:05.940]   I just love it.
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.220]   But on the other hand, when you're in the car
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:10.340]   and it can't be reading to the kid, it is a great way.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:12.220]   We took car trips with the kids, and we'd always
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.580]   have Audible books.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:14.220]   Here's a great one.
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:16.460]   The once and future King by T.H. White, the story of King
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:16.740]   Arthur.
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:21.100]   If you've got a teenager in the car with you, 33 hours.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.340]   I think it's great for a few--
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.020]   That's like Game of Thrones, 33.
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.580]   You'll just keep running because you
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:26.580]   want to keep listening.
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:27.420]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.740]   It'll keep you running.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.020]   Absolutely.
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.380]   Audible.com/Twit2-- two books are yours free.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:36.500]   If you go there, right now.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:37.740]   So does anybody know anything?
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.580]   First of all, Propeller is an interesting name
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.180]   for this Flipboard clone from Google,
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:44.220]   because Propeller was the name.
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.380]   Jason Calicanis gave his dig clone on AOL.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:47.740]   I did.
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.020]   I said the word he who shall not be named
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:53.060]   gave his dig clone on AOL.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.740]   I don't know if we know anything about this,
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.740]   but Propeller, anybody working on it?
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:00.740]   I just want to--
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:02.900]   just what we've been reading about it, which
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.060]   I'm excited about.
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:06.660]   I think Google's finally starting to show some--
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.940]   Sure.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:11.180]   --some creativity in the design space online,
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:13.580]   rather than having-- you know, Google Reader looks like crap
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:15.100]   still.
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.660]   But now you see what they're able to do with Google Plus,
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.140]   and you're starting to see this user interface.
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:22.100]   And I'm excited.
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.980]   I'm excited by the idea of them creating something that's, hey,
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:27.020]   tied right into Google Reader for crying out loud.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.660]   I mean, they've already got the pipeline there.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.100]   Right.
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:31.020]   Why not?
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.780]   You know, I have to say, I always get nervous when I see
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:35.940]   Google's going to do a consumer progress.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:36.440]   Right.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.180]   Because their design sense is so pedestrian and kind
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.100]   of engineering for--
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.440]   But you're seeing it shift, right?
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440]   You're starting to see a lot of Google Plus,
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.040]   the look and design of Google Plus.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.940]   You're starting to see that trickle into Google Docs.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:50.140]   You're starting to see it pop up all over the place.
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.580]   You're getting this clean, nice interface.
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.000]   So it'd be interesting to see what
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.840]   they're able to do with an iPad app that's set to rival
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:57.340]   Flipboard.
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.640]   I mean, I'd be excited by it because I love Flipboard.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.360]   But like I said, they've already got the pipes.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.580]   And one of the big criticisms against Flipboard, of course,
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:06.120]   is that it's scraping content, right?
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.860]   But here, it'd be interesting to see how Google's
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.860]   able to pull it off.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.620]   That criticism has been leveled against them
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:16.660]   at news.google.com from the likes of Rupert Murdoch
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.460]   and others, but taking content when it's really not,
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.300]   they're linking to content.
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:29.180]   So here's the Google ad for another product, Google,
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.860]   supposedly launching tomorrow.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:32.860]   I love this one.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:41.660]   How much did they pay for this?
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:42.620]   Look at that.
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:44.060]   It was worth it.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:44.860]   It was well worth it.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:45.860]   Yeah, it was worth it.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:54.420]   Now, is that actually from the "Sign Felt" episode?
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.180]   Yeah, that was one of the final season, season nine.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.180]   I was like, that was wearing the same suit.
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:01.700]   So all they had to do is just add that one
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:02.700]   little thing.
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.140]   Yeah, I've got the flyer.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.580]   The flyer of Google Wallet.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:09.700]   So tell us about Google Wallet.
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.860]   Alexia.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.060]   It is how it's called.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:12.940]   It's your article.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.780]   Tell us about Google Wallet.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:15.580]   What do you know?
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.340]   I know that it's using an S-C.
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:18.540]   It's likely launching--
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:22.220]   Nearfield Communications, which is a lass, only in two
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.060]   phones, one of them a Google phone.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.540]   So it's a direct comparative squares card case?
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.340]   Yeah, except that if you--
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:28.380]   They'll integrate offers.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.820]   If you have it on your phone, you just wave your phone.
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.420]   I use card case, which is not NFC.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.660]   But I mean, it uses GPS.
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:35.740]   It's pretty cool.
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:36.260]   Because in one case--
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:38.820]   Actually, card case, you just walk in the site glass.
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.380]   And they say, oh, hi, David.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:41.540]   Your coffee's waiting for you.
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:42.620]   You basically check in almost.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:43.100]   You like--
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:43.580]   I'm saying.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:45.340]   --and then when you're done, you just tell me your name.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:46.100]   They say, OK.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:46.940]   Yeah, we got it.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:48.220]   I love that idea.
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:49.860]   I can't wait myself.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.980]   I can't wait to get rid of my wallet.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:52.980]   Do you have a big--
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:53.660]   No, no, no.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:53.900]   George G
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:54.660]   stands over.
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:55.180]   I don't know.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.300]   It's not big.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:56.980]   Oh, that's not bad.
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:57.500]   It's not bad.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:57.980]   But that--
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.700]   I might need to-- we reviewed card case on App Judgment
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:01.780]   in revision three.
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:02.940]   I love card case.
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:05.540]   I think it's a great idea, except that nobody can use it.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:08.140]   In fact, the funny thing is, because it's GPS based,
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.820]   you can't have two stores next to each other using card case.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.660]   They actually have to separate the stores.
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:13.020]   Oh, really?
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:13.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.140]   Because it's GPS based.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:15.740]   Think about it.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:18.140]   OK, so if Google Wallet is NFC,
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.140]   and when more and more phones are NFC as well, which they
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:22.460]   will be, then I guess that would be a moot point, right?
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.460]   Well, the last thing about NFC is it's very short range.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:26.580]   NFC, you've got to get rid of that.
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:27.940]   Can you translate data on NFC?
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:29.900]   No, it's right next to it.
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.380]   I'm not sure.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:34.580]   I mean, it's like another version of an RFID.
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:37.300]   No, it's even shorter range than RFID.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.580]   So, and one of the things you can do with NFC
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:43.460]   is you can put a sticker, an NFC sticker on a phone
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:44.300]   that doesn't support it.
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:51.260]   So I expect when they launch it, they will be giving out stickers.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.100]   I don't know.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:54.300]   There's one phone, the Nexus S.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.500]   The Nexus S has it.
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.140]   That's right.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.540]   Does your Galaxy 2 have it?
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540]   No.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.460]   I'm asking Eileen.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.620]   But the new one should.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.700]   The one's coming out.
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.340]   Sprint one might have one.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:09.420]   The Sprint one just came out yesterday, the Galaxy 2.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:11.340]   I'm sure that the iPhone 5 will have it, right?
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:12.580]   Well, it's got to.
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:13.940]   It's got to be more screen-based.
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:16.140]   But doesn't Apple hate Google?
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:20.340]   Well, Apple do everything they can to put NFC out of business.
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:20.860]   I don't know.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:24.980]   If Google Wallet exists, doesn't Apple do everything they can to kill it?
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:26.700]   Who created the standard?
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:27.500]   For NFC?
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:29.020]   I don't know.
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.700]   It doesn't matter, because if you do a Google Wallet,
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.980]   it's not going to be an open wallet.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:34.780]   Right?
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:38.460]   It can't be, because you've got to have an API.
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.820]   I mean, think about how many people
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.420]   do not have a passcode lock on their phone, right?
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:43.900]   Like, if you live in New York City,
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:45.460]   you better have one, because you're
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:48.580]   going to leave your phone in a car all the time.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:51.620]   But I mean, I would love to have something like this on my phone
[01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:53.420]   to get on the subway on a regular basis.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:57.300]   Like, today I paid Starbucks with the Starbucks mobile app
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.140]   on my iPhone.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.500]   Even when you--
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.460]   I can't remember which airline.
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:04.580]   Is it Virgin?
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:06.300]   That allows you to use the barcode.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:06.900]   I was the phone.
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:08.340]   That's so cool.
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:10.380]   They don't have to print out a boarding pass.
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.140]   I just have it on my phone and I'm waving.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:14.180]   But will people use it?
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:16.780]   I mean, we saw that with Google Health, right?
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:19.980]   My wife still laments the death of Google Health.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:22.940]   She put all of her health documents over there.
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:23.940]   I did too.
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:24.620]   I did too.
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:25.500]   And it's gone, right?
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:28.260]   And so will people take to this and put all of their credit card
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.060]   information in here?
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:31.780]   Will people actually take to it?
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.860]   Hey, speaking of your wife and your child, your parent--
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:35.540]   Loique, you're a parent.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.380]   I'm a parent.
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:37.260]   What do you think of this?
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:39.500]   The Federal Trade Commission is proposing revisions
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:42.780]   to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:45.380]   COPPA.
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.940]   And I think anybody who runs a website
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.380]   is going to be a little bit nervous about this.
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:54.100]   To prevent websites from collecting tracking information
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:28:00.580]   about people under 13, that would include cookies and geolocation.
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:03.020]   If you have a kid under 13 going to a site,
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:05.700]   that site will have to secure parental consent
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:09.900]   before using tracking cookies.
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:12.620]   Now, I understand the desire to protect kids online.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.660]   But a number of people have said, pointed out,
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.420]   every site in the world uses browser cookies.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.660]   How are we going to-- does this mean that before you can use
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:25.500]   any site, we're going to have to do an age check?
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.660]   This could break the web.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:28.340]   This could break the web.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:30.340]   So it will never happen.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.460]   I agree.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.220]   I mean, this is not going to pass the smell test.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.300]   You think when you get a couple of companies
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:37.740]   sitting in front of Congress explaining like--
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:40.340]   you can imagine Amazon, before you visit Amazon,
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:42.940]   which may there's questionable content on Amazon, I think.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.100]   You're going to-- you're going to have
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:46.260]   to click on something that says you're age appropriate
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.340]   before you actually get in.
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:48.820]   That would mean the entire web.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:51.180]   You have to click before you get in.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:53.140]   I mean, the argument is that these companies have hundreds
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:54.820]   of millions of dollars in funding
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:57.620]   so that they should figure it out technologically.
[01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:00.660]   Because it's more important that you protect kids
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:05.700]   than you have a couple of seconds of delay
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.340]   in entering a site.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.540]   I'd like to know what they mean by these browser tracking
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:11.260]   cookies, however.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:14.020]   Because for all browsers, all websites set cookies,
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:15.700]   which could ostensibly be used to track.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.940]   I mean, it's a unique ID.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:18.820]   We set cookies.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:21.060]   Every browser set, every website sets cookies.
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:21.660]   We set cookies.
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:23.380]   Does that mean the tweet before you'd
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:24.820]   be allowed to visit the tweet page?
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.300]   You'd have to prove you were searching.
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.980]   How do you know, right, as an editor or owner of a site,
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:30.860]   how do you know that?
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:34.060]   Like, that you have to shut down or not put a cookie to someone.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.860]   It's really just difficult to implement.
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:38.660]   I think the way you implement it is very simple.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:42.020]   That you put a tracking device on children.
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:43.020]   And a--
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.500]   A caller?
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:45.620]   It doesn't matter.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:48.380]   And as soon as they go near a computer, it shuts off.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:48.900]   Exactly.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.500]   Like, Willow the Cat, which--
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.700]   I don't know if you saw Willow the Cat, which had a chip
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:53.620]   in its neck this week.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:56.380]   And for five years ago, Vanish from Colorado wound up
[01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.220]   in New York, and they found it because of the little chip
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:58.820]   in its neck.
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:29:59.460]   I love that.
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.900]   That's like, how-- homeward bound.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:01.900]   I just don't get it.
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:03.100]   I don't get it.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:05.300]   Why did the cat walk to New York?
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.980]   What the hell is going on?
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:07.940]   The pizza.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:09.140]   Kig of that pizza in Colorado.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.060]   You're right.
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:11.860]   This cat is smart.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.740]   You know, I saw this story, and I thought, what?
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.140]   How do they know it's the same cat?
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:16.700]   Maybe it's just another calico.
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:17.660]   It's a chip.
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.060]   They knew it was a chip.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.660]   We had-- in fact, the owners weren't there.
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:23.140]   We had the cat on the show today.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:23.660]   Really?
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.980]   That's amazing.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:25.980]   Our level of guests.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.500]   Let me just tell you what they did.
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.780]   Coming up on Fox and Friends, Willow the Cat.
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:33.300]   We've got a llama and a Willow the Cat.
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.500]   But no, they didn't even have the owners there yet.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:38.660]   Somebody had found the cat ran the scanner on the chip
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:40.460]   and found out that the owners lived in Colorado.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:44.260]   They were flying there to the city to pick up the cat.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.940]   It was like the local ASPCA, whatever had the cat,
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:49.540]   and was able to scan its neck.
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.460]   You know, it gives good hope.
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.940]   It gives hope to all cat owners who've lost a cat.
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.460]   I've lost cats that maybe the cat didn't get--
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:58.580]   I always assume the cat got run over or found a new owner.
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:00.660]   Maybe they're just walking to New York.
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.180]   Right.
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:03.740]   Like Midnight Cowboy.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:04.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:05.740]   Everybody's talking at me.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:06.580]   It's talking at me.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.740]   Five-year walk.
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:08.740]   I think we're more bound.
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:09.180]   Have you seen this?
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.220]   Yes, homework's bound.
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:11.220]   That's the story.
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:11.900]   What's the story?
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.420]   But it's a dog in a cat, right?
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:15.860]   It's Chansey and Shadow.
[01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:19.980]   OK.
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:21.980]   All right.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.060]   Glad I provided a battle.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:26.780]   Have I told you about Netflix.com/toy?
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:29.300]   We're so glad that you all were here.
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.780]   I just love having a party with Loeweek,
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:32.660]   bring in the wine.
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:33.740]   It just makes it so much fun.
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.060]   Loeweek, LaMure, is at seismic.com.
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.700]   Loeweib.net is coming up soon.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.180]   And you're inviting all European entrepreneurs
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:45.180]   and people who are interested in startups to go, aren't you?
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:45.700]   Of course.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.140]   Of course.
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:49.460]   But if you can't get to Paris this December,
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.340]   you can always watch it on Twitch.
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.620]   And you can watch it, yeah, on that.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.860]   You stream actually all the streamers.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:55.740]   You know, it's kind of fun because what you're already
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:57.420]   doing is, and you have done for some years,
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:59.100]   is streaming the event itself.
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.820]   We're going to be backstage.
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.020]   We'll do the backstage stream.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:03.660]   Which never happened, which will be amazing.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:04.940]   That's going to be so much fun.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.500]   The stage got a quarter of a million viewers last year.
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.020]   That's awesome.
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.940]   Because it's all free and worldwide.
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.940]   Leo's going to live crowd surf.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:14.900]   No, not on the web.
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:17.660]   It's going to be amazing because the stage is only
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:18.660]   like 20 minutes.
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:20.900]   So you're going to have more time with the speakers you want.
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:22.380]   I think it's really great.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:24.020]   I'm really looking forward to that.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.540]   You've always done a great job of streaming it.
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.660]   Last time you had backstage cameras, cameras everywhere.
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:32.260]   It's just really fun to watch the streaming event.
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:34.700]   And then have the Twitter feed on as well.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:38.980]   It will be Twitter and Paris in December.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.740]   Mr. David Prager.
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.140]   Prager.
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.020]   Revision3.com.
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.300]   Always great to have you.
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:45.980]   Thank you for coming.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:46.940]   Thanks for having me again.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:47.860]   Out here.
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:48.500]   We appreciate it.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.900]   I know it's a bit of a drive.
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:52.340]   Alexia Totsis, they're saying in the chatroom,
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:54.700]   you should have Alexia on more, and I couldn't agree more.
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.100]   We'll get you the root beer if you'll come and visit.
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:57.620]   Awesome.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:58.580]   Just give me a pipe.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.820]   A root beer pipe.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:02.260]   You could just shoot the root beer direct.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.860]   Did you see, by the way, I'm going to end with this.
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:07.780]   I'm going to thank you also for being here, Clayton.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.620]   Great to have you.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:09.060]   Absolutely.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:12.020]   Make sure you get that chip on your kid, OK?
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.100]   Well, we're getting injected next week.
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:20.220]   If he walks here, we just want to be able to identify him 100%.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:23.980]   Stevie Wonder performing in Echo Park last night.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:26.660]   Let me see if I can pull this up because I have to skip in on this clip
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:31.300]   about 440 in on this clip.
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:32.500]   And I'm sure I'm going to get in trouble.
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.580]   You know, we got pulled down because--
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:37.700]   could you talk to Rupert for me, Clayton?
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:40.860]   Because we got pulled down because we played some Simpson's content
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:41.780]   last week.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:42.900]   We got pulled off of YouTube.
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.620]   Can you just do something for me?
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:46.380]   I'll give him a call.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:47.220]   Would you?
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:48.180]   Rupert.
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:50.260]   This is Stevie Wonder in Echo Park.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.260]   Do something.
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.260]   Do that one.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.980]   Let me roll.
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:56.580]   I don't know if he can understand him.
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:57.900]   We can make this happen.
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:00.460]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:06.220]   And I want you to give a hand to someone, as you know,
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:10.060]   his health is very bad at this time.
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.580]   But put someone who--
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:19.380]   if his company took the challenge in making his technology accessible
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:27.820]   to everyone in the spirit of caring and moving the world forward,
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:28.860]   Steve Jobs.
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:30.580]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:32.060]   I think that's pretty awesome.
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:34.140]   Stevie Wonder acknowledging Apple for the--
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:35.140]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:42.060]   There's nothing on the iPhone or the iPad that you can do that I can't do.
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:46.700]   Acknowledging Apple for their accessibility and rightly so.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:48.740]   I can be talking to you.
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:50.580]   You can be looking at me.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:52.380]   And I can be doing what I need to do.
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:53.780]   And you only do what I'm doing.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:57.620]   Apparently, he's a face time user, too.
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:58.500]   So pretty awesome.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.460]   That's Stevie Wonder from an Echo Park concert last night.
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:02.460]   I thought that was great.
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:03.340]   We're just fine.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.420]   I'm posting that on TechRide.
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.540]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:06.300]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.580]   That's LA Times.
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:08.020]   Wow.
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:08.780]   They're a newspaper.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:11.180]   You probably heard of them.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.740]   Really, really kind of me.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.260]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.420]   Do you forget the week ahead?
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:15.940]   Say again?
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:17.060]   Oh, we have that?
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:18.060]   I'm so sorry.
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:18.580]   We do.
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:21.660]   You know, one of the things we like to do during Twitter
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:24.780]   is to take a look at stories that are becoming up in the week ahead.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:25.860]   And of course, you know that we'll
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.100]   be covering those stories with Tom Merritt on Tech News
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:33.340]   today, every weekday 230 Pacific 530 Eastern on twit.tv.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.860]   And Tom, what's coming up this week?
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.860]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:38.060]   Here's a look at some of the stories
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.100]   we'll be checking on in the week ahead on Tech News
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:40.660]   today.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.940]   It's a big day to day for AT&T, actually.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:45.380]   They're unveiling the impulse 4G for $30.
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:46.100]   Nice, cheap phone.
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:49.420]   The Acer Iconia Tab A501 with HSPA Plus,
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:50.700]   available on contract.
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.860]   The Xperia Play 4G comes to AT&T.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.060]   And the big announcement, they're
[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:57.940]   officially launching LTE service in five cities.
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.460]   Tomorrow, Monday, September 19th,
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:01.700]   is International Talk Like A Pirate Day.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:04.460]   So if you're still enjoying that meme, have a good day.
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.020]   Tuesday, September 20th, here's the award's limited edition
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.460]   Xbox 360 is coming.
