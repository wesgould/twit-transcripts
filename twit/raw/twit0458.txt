[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.680]   Tim Stevens, Jason Snell, join us.
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.520]   We'll talk about the FCC's net neutrality proposals,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.600]   what they really mean, Google, and Apple
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.680]   bury the hatchet in a very surprising move.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.200]   And this is just in YouTube about to buy

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.920]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   The show that covers the week's Tech News,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.880]   a great team of professional technology journalists
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.360]   in the studio today to discuss the tech news.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.880]   It's actually one in the studio, the fabulous Jason Snell,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.640]   executive--
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.440]   I'm a team of one.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.360]   Team of one.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.480]   Team of just one, but that's OK.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.960]   Jason is-- what are you, executive director, executive
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.400]   editor--
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.920]   Sure.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.760]   --an editorial director.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.680]   Editorial director.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.280]   I know there was a director in there.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.040]   I had IDG.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.440]   I shot action every now and then.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.360]   What did you do?
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   Cut.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.080]   Yeah, of course, for a long time editor and chief at Macworld.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.320]   Are you still out of your chief at Macworld,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.400]   or did you have to give it up?
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.920]   Sort of technical.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.520]   There is no editor and chief at Macworld right now.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.600]   So I guess technically it's me, but Dan Miller
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.960]   does a lot of the work for me.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.160]   But you also now cover Windows, which is nice PC world.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.520]   Right, so I'm in charge of PC World and Greenbot,
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.360]   which is our Android site, and TechHive, which
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.160]   is covering a whole bunch of different tech consumer
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   content.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.840]   That is a minute destination.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.720]   I know you developed that.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.680]   We talked about that a matter of a year ago, I think.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.840]   Yeah, it's been a little one.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.040]   You should play FlappyGol.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.240]   Oh, you should play FlappyGol.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.960]   No, no, no, no.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.760]   That's Tim Stevens over there.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.280]   Tim's--
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.720]   I would say, Nanny said, covers motor sports,
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.200]   drives his own little--
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.600]   I guess the ice racing's over for the season.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.480]   Yeah, I'm sorry to say it's a little bit too warm for that.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.160]   It'd be late racing at this point,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.400]   and that's not good in this group.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.520]   Not good.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.360]   Not good.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.320]   Well, thank you for breaking away from the coverage
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   of the trials for the Indianapolis 500
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.920]   and joining us this afternoon.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.400]   Appreciate it.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.680]   So gosh, the biggest story which just broke--
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   and I don't think it's too much of a surprise we've
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.480]   heard rumors about it all weekend--
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.680]   not Apple buying beats.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.200]   I don't know what happened to that.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   I want to just disappear.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.080]   It's out there.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.640]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.400]   But the room--
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.680]   buffering, yes.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.080]   Please wait.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.280]   Buffering.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.680]   But the real story is $48.5 billion,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.000]   AT&T buys DirectTV, the satellite TV provider.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.080]   They've been kind of partners for a long time.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.000]   That was part of the--
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.960]   A triple play package before you versus came along.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.360]   Why did AT&T buy DirectTV?
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.840]   Anybody?
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.200]   Anybody.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.880]   All the cool kids are doing it.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.400]   Hey, everybody's got somebody.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.080]   Well, AT&T, so they've got--
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.960]   they're in a weird broadband place, right?
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.840]   They've got their fiber in some places.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.000]   Mostly DSL, right?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.240]   Right, but it's mostly DSL.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.120]   They don't have a lot of TV except in those universe markets.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.160]   Is the universe fiber always or can it be DSL as well?
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.000]   Well, they've kind of rebranded.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.640]   I got an email the other week saying
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.960]   that universe was available to me for the first time.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.200]   And I checked because the fiber is right on the other side
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   of the freeway from my house.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   So it's a mile away, but it's not in my house.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.040]   So I got all excited.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.640]   I was like, oh, right, fiber in my neighborhood.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.920]   And I looked and it was rebranded DSL
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.040]   that they just decided to call Uverse but was not actually fiber.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.000]   So much guarantee.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.920]   And you'll be unhappy with everything.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.800]   Yeah, right, exactly.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.560]   I used to have that.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.240]   I had the AT&T DSL.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.160]   And I switched to Comcast only because I needed it to be faster,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.360]   not that I love Comcast.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.320]   Anyway, I mean, DirectTV does give them access
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.200]   to a whole huge customer base.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.720]   And they're a TV provider.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.680]   They're not a very good broadband provider
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.000]   because of the latency and satellite.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.680]   But it gives them another piece of the puzzle, which I think
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.480]   all of this mass media consolidation is really puzzling to me.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.040]   I'm not sure quite what all the financial ins and outs are.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.560]   It feels like you have to have critical mass in some way.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.920]   Does DirectTV still do the Hughes internet satellite stuff?
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.800]   So they still do internet.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   Yeah, and if you're--
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.080]   Just upgrade that not too long ago.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.400]   They're up to, oh, yeah, a couple megabits down anyway.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.320]   They're still-- they'll even see they can't get that down
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.400]   much under a second.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.560]   Thanks for having 800 milliseconds.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.880]   I didn't test that too long ago.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.240]   And it is much improved than it used to be five or six years ago.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.760]   But still, there's only so much you can do with latency.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.520]   And maybe this partnership with AT&T
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.320]   will give them some more communications options
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.080]   for the upload side of things and to get the latency down.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.480]   But yeah, I see this as a content play.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.600]   This gives AT&T a lot of good content partnerships
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.200]   for streaming video, video on demand, that kind of thing.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.320]   And NFL more than anything has said.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.960]   DirectTV has the NFL Sunday ticket deal.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.080]   And that is very lucrative.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.480]   17 weeks a year, that is a very valuable property.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.320]   I don't want to poo poo the satellite internet too much.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.960]   Those of us who live in big cities
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.480]   are used to having faster internet or even in suburban areas.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.480]   But I grew up on the country in Sonora, Northern California.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.520]   And most of the people I went to high school with who
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.920]   are still there, they're all on satellite broadband
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.200]   because it is faster than any other option.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.160]   So they're just having more pieces to the puzzle.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.920]   And yeah, the DirectTV deal with the NFL
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.040]   is assuming that continues long term.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.840]   Maybe there's a way they can parlay that into something
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.400]   they can roll out to other subscribers,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.520]   although Verizon has the deal for mobile streaming
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.200]   for the NFL.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.280]   So it runs up against that.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.320]   I think that's why it's interesting.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.800]   Probably an anti-virusing move.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.120]   Well, Tim is up in the country.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.400]   But you don't use satellite.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.640]   I actually tried to use satellite when I first moved
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.920]   to this place about two years ago.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.080]   And there was no cable access when I moved here.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.840]   So we did try the new Hughes system, which was pretty good.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.840]   But I just couldn't get over the latency that wasn't good enough.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.080]   Especially for this kind of thing.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.840]   There'd be a two second delay, pretty much.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.880]   Yeah, it's unused for Skype.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.600]   So when I switched over to Verizon,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.720]   has an LTE to the home service that I was using for a little while.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.240]   That was pretty good, except as you may remember,
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.240]   we had a couple instances where it kind of dropped out.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.680]   And that wasn't very much fun.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.800]   So now I do have cable here.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.560]   We paid time order to bring it out to the house.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.360]   But yeah, satellite internet has definitely
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.440]   gotten much better in terms of the outright speed.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.280]   But I don't think there's really much they can do,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.560]   at least through satellite technology,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.120]   when it comes to getting that latency down,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.280]   which is a big issue for online gaming
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.200]   and anything that you need any kind of responsiveness.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.520]   But if you're talking about streaming,
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.120]   streaming Netflix, that kind of thing,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.360]   it was actually perfectly fine for that.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   I was able to get 1080p streaming through Netflix
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.800]   with no issue over satellite.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.520]   And I think that's pretty impressive.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.200]   You do have fair use caps.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.280]   And that's a bit of a problem.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.280]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.120]   But last time I checked, it was pretty low.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.400]   It was in the hundreds of--
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.880]   But 30 not even that.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.920]   I think they're maximum of about 50 gigabytes,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.320]   which for me on cable before I moved here,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.040]   I was about 500 gigabytes a month.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.360]   So that was obviously a bit of an adjustment
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.760]   to try and make that work.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.680]   And that was the same thing on Verizon, too.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.760]   I think between 30 and 50 gigabytes was the maximum.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.360]   And then it was something like $10 per gigabyte.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.720]   Once you went over that, and that gets very expensive
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.600]   very quickly.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.920]   So you just heard the thing that makes this whole net
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.960]   neutrality debate very interesting.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.000]   You, Jason Stell, were on DSL but switched to cable
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.160]   because it was faster.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.680]   Tim Stevens out in the country paid time Warner
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.760]   to bring him cable because it was faster.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.920]   But I love Tim Warner.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.720]   But yeah, I wrote them out very largely.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.640]   And you hate Comcast?
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.360]   You hate Tim Warner?
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.920]   I've got Comcast the same thing.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.800]   Nobody likes their cable company.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.560]   Nobody likes their cable company.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   And in most cases, they're really the only viable choice.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.200]   Yes, you may.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.960]   And this is where that net neutrality debate comes up
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.880]   is, yes, you may have other choices.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.600]   If you're lucky, you have DSL choices.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.280]   You might have in satellite choices.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.840]   Almost everybody has that.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.520]   But nobody really wants that.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.360]   Everybody wants cable.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.040]   So which gives these cable companies immense power.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.480]   And that's why we're very nervous about these access lanes.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.200]   So this was the week Thursday.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.240]   Finally, we saw the rules that Tom Wheeler and the FCC
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.520]   have been talking about for several weeks.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.320]   We've been talking about for several weeks.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.440]   They were as predicted.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.280]   And by the way, they're not implemented.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.080]   This is merely they voted to three to two.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.680]   It was a close vote to offer these rules up
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.560]   and give people a chance to comment.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.960]   Highly recommend that you watch this week's This Week in Law,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   Denise Howell, and a very heated debate.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.280]   Nielei Patel talking with a regular on This Week in Law,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.960]   whose name is-- I've forgotten.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.760]   Say again?
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.920]   Baron is his first name.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.120]   Baron Zorich or something like that.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.000]   But it was almost a fistfight.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.200]   I mean, it was very heated.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.400]   As one would expect, Nielei Patel of Vox and The Verge
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.680]   was very concerned about the future of net neutrality.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.200]   The question is-- and this was the one thing that might have
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.200]   been changed in the rules thanks to all of the conversation
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.000]   over the last couple of weeks--
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.280]   Tom Wheeler did propose, and the FCC
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.040]   did adopt the proposal, that perhaps they
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.560]   should look at reclassifying broadband providers
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.000]   as common carriers, so-called Title II
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.600]   of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.240]   This is something that a lot of geeks have said is a good idea.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   The genesis of this is that the open internet rules originally
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.400]   proposed by the FCC were thrown out in court for eyes and sued.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.000]   The court said, look, we understand
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.600]   there is a strong compelling argument for open internet,
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.920]   but you don't have the jurisdiction,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.880]   as the FCC under the Telecommunications Act,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.760]   Section 706, which is what the FCC was using as justification
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.040]   for controlling the internet, isn't it?
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.480]   The court said, you could go the Title II route.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.720]   FCC has up to now, I think, kind of rejected that
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.520]   as a possibility, but this is for the first time
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.320]   they've actually raised and said, in effect to us,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.040]   what do you think should we go Title II?
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.880]   And that was the big debate on this week in law,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.920]   was whether Title II was a good idea.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.760]   It would certainly bring a lot of regulation in.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.960]   And God knows, nobody wants government regulation
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.680]   on the internet, but at the same time--
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.040]   Nobody wants monopolies controlling the internet,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.560]   either.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.640]   That's the real problem.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.200]   And I think it would be fair to say,
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.800]   nobody really wants the internet to be in a position in the US
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.600]   where it is a common carrier issue, where there's no choice.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.880]   But that's where we are, is there's-- in most markets,
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.840]   there's no choice, no legitimate choice for broadband internet.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.120]   And I don't consider the AT&T DSL that
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.040]   runs to my house legitimate competition for Comcast.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.740]   And in a situation like that, that's
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.920]   when you have to kind of pull out the common carrier rules,
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.020]   which are pretty serious, because that's a lot of regulation.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.440]   And it's kind of scary to go down that path.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.200]   But I don't know what other choice we have left
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.260]   in an environment where almost nobody
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.880]   has decent competition for broadband.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.880]   That's the real problem.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.360]   I mean, you could talk about the open market,
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.320]   the value of the open market.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.160]   But if you don't have competition,
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.600]   there is an open market.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.000]   Maybe the FCC should act to encourage competition.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.680]   One of the things that Title II would allow it to do,
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.120]   for instance, is tell the cable companies,
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.020]   you need to open up your network for access
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.540]   to other internet service providers, just as DSL is open.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.540]   Right.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.780]   I didn't actually have AT&T DSL at the end.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.180]   I had DSL Extreme, which is a reseller.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.820]   So there's a whole sale price.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.340]   Right.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.980]   So they buy internet from AT&T, basically wholesale,
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.260]   and then resell it with-- so instead of getting your--
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.820]   with your ISP, you get a web host, an email,
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.660]   and access to this, and access to that,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.180]   the idea would be those would be the differentiating features.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.820]   The bare internet would just be something
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.520]   that everybody could resell with their own stuff on top of it.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.480]   And in this case, one of the wonderful features
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.280]   that would differentiate is--
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.940]   and by the way, we don't charge for access to our subscribers.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.420]   You have a fast lane access to everybody on the internet.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.500]   But we tried to get, by the way, and Dane wasn't able to make it.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.160]   But we were going to get Dane Jasper, who
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.780]   is the founder and CEO of SonicNet, which
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.720]   is one of the foremost internet service providers
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.180]   in the country, and a very outspoken advocate
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.260]   of open internet, and would love access.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.620]   They're running fiber in a lot.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.180]   They're trying to compete as much as they can.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.100]   They're doing a lot of double DSL, too,
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.300]   which held the line for a while against cable, where you essentially--
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.180]   We have that product.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.380]   You have bonded DSL.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:25.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.900]   And it was-- it's still not as fast as cable,
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.700]   but it's faster.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.380]   It's in our basement.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.780]   They want to compete.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.700]   And competition's good.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.180]   Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of it.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.700]   So either they need to do something to allow competition,
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.380]   or we're going to be in common carrier land, I would hope,
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.140]   because those are the only real options.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.900]   Otherwise, our internet is going to be pretty poor.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.060]   I like Mike Elgin's article in the computer world this week.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.420]   He said, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is the Michelangelo
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.860]   of lobbyists, and his proposal for net neutrality
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.660]   is his Sistine Chapel.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.900]   He calls him the lobbyist in charge.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.180]   And that's really what's happened.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.340]   This guy worked for more than a decade
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.180]   at the National Cable Telecommunications Association,
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.460]   eventually becoming its president.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.220]   He worked in the wireless industry,
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.860]   as well as in the Hall of Fame of both the wireless
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.020]   and the cable industry for his tireless efforts
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.620]   on behalf of those industries.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.900]   So it's hard to believe that he would himself lobby
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.420]   for regulating these industries.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.740]   And AT&T Fire Labrief this week saying that, for instance,
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.260]   Title II was a terrible idea.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.580]   It would make it impossible for internet service providers
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.860]   to do their job.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.420]   And this is where I don't want to get too much into this battle.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:44.420]   I think the battle, Barron and Neelai's debate on Twill
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.780]   is a very good example of how people who share
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.300]   our interests in open internet disagree
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.580]   over what the right path is.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.020]   And I know when we had John Perry Barlow
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.820]   on one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.500]   he said the debates on the board, even at the EFF,
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.980]   at the board level are intense because, you know,
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.660]   there's a strong prejudice against government regulation
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.860]   of the internet, but at the same time,
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.180]   it's not clear what the path is to keep the internet open.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.340]   And we all agree we need an open internet.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.740]   - And I've been concerned what Title II would mean
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.860]   for Google fibers, they're trying to spread it
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.460]   and give more access to that.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.340]   And I mean, that almost certainly would slow down
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.380]   that effort whereas we want, you know, Google fiber
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.660]   to spread throughout the US very quickly.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.100]   More regulation would slow them down
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.740]   and it may even stop that effort altogether,
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.860]   which would be very, very disappointing,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.380]   very frustrating because that is part of what is starting
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.500]   to build some competition in those limited markets
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.620]   where it's available.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.420]   And you know, competition is good in general
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.220]   and helps to build innovation and helps
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.260]   these services to get better, but like I said, Jason,
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.860]   there really is no effective competition
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.140]   in most of these markets.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.700]   And that right now, it just means that these guys
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.820]   are able to charge what they want to,
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.780]   not innovate at all and consumers are kind of less stuck.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.540]   - I almost want to burn the house down.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.660]   I think sometimes what happens with activists is,
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.260]   they say, great, let's screw the internet up
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.740]   because that'll force us to find an alternative.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.980]   One of the real good alternatives
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.300]   is never gonna happen unless things go vastly wrong,
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.620]   which is for community municipal internet's to spring up,
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.340]   for communities to take over those broadband lines
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.620]   using imminent domain, saying,
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.060]   we're gonna run these as a utility.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.580]   This is like gas and electric and water.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.860]   And we're gonna provide that let companies come in
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.300]   and ride on top of it and offer you choice,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.540]   create competition in their communities,
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.060]   eliminate this whole thing.
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.500]   And I feel like if we just let Tom Wheeler screw
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.140]   the internet up, maybe we have a chance at that.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.820]   - Unfortunately, most of these small governments
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.620]   just don't have, this is highly technical.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.740]   Well, it's so technical.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.660]   And do they have the budgets to even try it?
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.740]   And I have friends who live in Alameda here in the Bay Area
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.100]   and they used to have their own cable internet company.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.420]   And they, I think they handed it all back to Comcast
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.980]   because a little city under financial strain
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.460]   trying to manage their own, be their own ISP
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.380]   and run cable to people's houses is,
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.460]   it's asking a lot.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.900]   I mean, that's the hard thing is that infrastructure is hard
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.740]   and it's expensive.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.260]   And you want people, you know, companies investing
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.580]   in the infrastructure to be able to get a return,
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.580]   but you also wanna have competition and, you know,
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.180]   a lot of these issues become less, you know,
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.900]   the great panacea here is net neutrality, right?
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.380]   Net neutrality, it's like, well, you can charge me
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.940]   and you can have stupid services
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.980]   that you're trying to, to foist upon me,
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.020]   but at least you can't mess up my internet.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.140]   The internet is the internet.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.420]   And that's the thing that's frustrating
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.980]   about all this net neutrality talk is
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.700]   when the internet isn't the internet anymore.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.940]   It's playing favorites and cutting backroom deals
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.380]   and making certain sites faster and certain sites slower.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.940]   And that's, you know, when it gets all messed up.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.780]   - Yeah.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.020]   And it's obviously happening now.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.580]   I mean, it's so blatantly apparent
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.140]   that Netflix is being capped on many, many service providers.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.140]   And that right there is, you know, as ugly and old,
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.260]   and as you need for what's going to come in the future,
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.700]   is something doesn't change.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.740]   And, yeah, unfortunately, it's so ugly to find out exactly
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.780]   what that change needs to be.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.820]   It's so difficult to find out.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.700]   As you've said, there's so many conflicts
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.180]   and so many challenges.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.260]   But yeah, it's something obviously needs to change
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.860]   we're at a point now where maybe legislation
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.340]   is the only thing that's going to keep things,
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.660]   keep things somewhat clean.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.940]   But yeah, it's the choice of the lesser of two evils.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.580]   And I honestly don't know which is,
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.660]   which is the lesser at this point myself.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.820]   - Well, it's frustrating for me
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.820]   because I feel like there's so much innovation
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.940]   that happens on the internet.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.180]   And companies like mine wouldn't exist
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.980]   if I didn't have free and easy access
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.860]   to every one of the people who want to listen.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.220]   If I were put on a slow lane,
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.220]   we wouldn't be able to offer you live broadcasts
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.020]   because you wouldn't be able to watch them
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.060]   in any reasonable way.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.980]   Here's from TechDirt,
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.420]   a graph the cable industry offered,
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.740]   proffered, implying that they were increasing
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.660]   their investments in infrastructure.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.740]   This is, well, it turns out a little bit
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.340]   of a misleading graph.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.220]   It says in 1996, they invested $5 billion in 2013,
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.020]   210 billion, but what this graph doesn't tell you,
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.300]   this is cumulative investment.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   So the 210 billion is over those 20 years.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.420]   And in fact, if you look at actual investment,
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.060]   well, the tail is not quite so encouraging
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.100]   after doing big build outs,
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:23.100]   spending upwards of $20 billion in 2000 and 2001,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.100]   some significant drop in investment
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.780]   over the last few years.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.500]   I'm curious if the investment the last few years
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.460]   includes the money they paid Verizon
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.500]   to stop building out Fios to decrease competition.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.220]   So that's interesting.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.420]   So wait a minute, I want to hear,
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.020]   because I know Verizon was building out Fios
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.100]   at great cost, about $5,000 a subscriber,
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.340]   and then they decided to stop.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.260]   Why did they stop?
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.300]   Well, apparently there was a deal
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.940]   that they cut with the cable companies
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.500]   to just back off and not do it.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.540]   If we call that, yeah, collusion.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.340]   Unbelievable.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.180]   No, no, it was just good business, I'm sure.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.340]   Well, and you know, you can't expect these companies
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.660]   not to act in their own interest.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.660]   That's what they're publicly health companies.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.460]   They have a fiduciary responsibility to stakeholders
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.580]   to squeeze their customers as dry as they possibly can.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.020]   That's why we have to take our own future
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.820]   into our own hands and do something about it.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.740]   We can't expect them.
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.060]   And it's foolish to expect them to do anything but act
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.900]   in their own interest.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.860]   It is a funny conversation that we're having now
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.620]   where we're all really getting up in arms
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.740]   about asking for free market competition.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.580]   I mean, this is not like we're asking for some crazy,
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.220]   like internet communism where the people own the internet
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.500]   and there's nothing nobody can profit from it.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.060]   We're just saying, hey, can we have the big companies
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.140]   fight each other over us instead of just cutting deals
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.460]   and each having their own little monopolies
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.660]   and their own markets.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.540]   That's what's hurting customers.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.100]   All we want is a free market.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:53.940]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.540]   Is that too much to ask in America?
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.940]   And Comcast to fight it out for my business.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.780]   That's what I want.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.820]   That's all.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.860]   Instead of having these local monopolies,
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.100]   which they all have, well, I'm glad actually Tim,
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.300]   you got cable finally in there
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.940]   'cause you really look much better.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.780]   At least for the timing.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.660]   That's the other problem is all these companies are.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.500]   I'm getting into you know, Liam.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.420]   Yeah, well that too.
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.420]   Yeah, that too.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.140]   You do look like you've been working out.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.420]   All of these companies are in the same business
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.980]   as the companies that they're providing.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.060]   You know, Skype competes directly
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.460]   with the VoIP offerings of Comcast and Verizon
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.980]   and Time Warner.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:36.260]   If Netflix competes directly with the cable offerings
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.180]   of Comcast.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.420]   So that's the worst thing is that these companies
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.100]   can act anti-competitively.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.900]   Now Tom Wheeler says, I'm not gonna let that happen.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.820]   And I trust him.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.660]   I really do.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:53.340]   All right, we're gonna continue on in just a little bit.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.980]   Good panel here, Jason Snell, Tim Stevens.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.660]   Glad you're here.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.780]   And a great studio audience.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.980]   Thank you all for joining us.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.740]   It's nice to have a handsome group.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.300]   It's a handsome group.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.180]   Last week they were all wearing shorts.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.060]   It was a little too much.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.340]   I couldn't take it.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.300]   Fortunately, we got long pants, right?
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.140]   All right.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.100]   (laughs)
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.220]   I'm just kidding.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.780]   Wear shorts if you want.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.540]   Strip down if you feel more comfortable.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.460]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.300]   I love Linda Wimey.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.100]   You know Linda Wimey, I'm sure.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.060]   Gosh, I've known her for years.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.540]   She was a regular on the screen savers.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.820]   She used to write for us at Mackerels.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.660]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.500]   All the time, yeah.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.980]   Wrote these great books on web design and development.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.500]   She created a company, Linda.com,
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.900]   that teaches people how to use software,
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.820]   how to program, how to become better photographers,
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.540]   how to use Photoshop better.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.620]   Linda.com is a great resource for anybody who wants to learn.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.740]   And now they have over 2,400 courses
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.100]   in pretty much every category.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.220]   510 courses on web design,
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.020]   414 courses on photography,
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.460]   534 courses on business.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.620]   Things like creating a resume, negotiating a deal.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.860]   And tens of thousands of video tutorials.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.100]   The way it works is great too,
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.740]   because you get unlimited access for a low monthly fee.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   You can have any course you want.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.260]   You could jump right in at the beginning
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.300]   or because they have transcripts of every course
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.540]   you can search for the subject matter
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.820]   or the tip that you're interested in, go right there.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.620]   You can, there's new courses all the time
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.020]   they just released a course on.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.100]   This is a good one, how to prepare and print 3D models
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:32.380]   using Photoshop, how to master the fundamentals of photography.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.060]   Some of my best friends, Bert Monroi, Ben Long,
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.460]   teaching courses at Linda.com.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.060]   You can learn about web design and development,
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.580]   everything from WordPress to jQuery.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.780]   Do you use Windows?
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.460]   They've got a Windows 8 One course,
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.020]   Windows 8 One, update One course.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.820]   They've got Microsoft Creative Cloud Final Cut Logic Pro.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.940]   Linda.com, currently 2,577 courses
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.620]   more added every single week for every level,
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.940]   beginning or intermediate advanced.

[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.380]   well produced videos with the top professionals in their field
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.380]   who are passionate about teaching.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.980]   Whether you have 15 minutes or 15 hours,
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.340]   each course is structured so you can learn
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.700]   at the pace and the style you want.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.060]   Linda.com also offers certificates of completion.

[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.180]   or Premiere, a Photoshop.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.140]   Not only is $25 a month for access

[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.260]   Let me thank them for their support of this week.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.100]   In tech.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.100]   Let's see here.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.100]   Should we talk about Google?
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.100]   Actually, some good news.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.100]   I mentioned this, I think this week on Mac Break Weekly,
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.100]   after the Apple Samsung trial,
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.100]   finally ground to a close.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.100]   Samsung won a little more than $100 million.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.100]   Apple won a little more than $100 million.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.100]   Samsung won a little more than $100,000.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.100]   The awards are getting smaller,
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.100]   but the cost of the company is getting greater
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.100]   with the discovery, these documents,
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.100]   secret documents having to be released to the public.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.100]   I just feel like this is a war that nobody wins.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.100]   It's bad for PR.
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.100]   It's bad for the companies.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.100]   I think maybe they're starting to realize that,
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.100]   because Apple and Google have decided to throw in the towel.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.100]   Apple and Motorola were suing each other for patents.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   They decided not only to drop those suits,
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.100]   but not to license, just to say, "Okay, use it."
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.100]   You think I'm right?
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.100]   Do you think that Apple is finally realizing
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.100]   that these lawsuits, winner-lose, are bad for business?
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.100]   Well, first I want to say that it's not bad for everybody.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.100]   My sister-in-law actually works at the law for the same son
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.100]   that's using.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.100]   That's the winner.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.100]   They're doing fine.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.100]   It's good for them.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   But, yeah, I think a lot of the criticism I wrote
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.100]   a thing about it, a bunch of people did about that book,
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.100]   Haunted Empire, which says how Apple lost its way.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.100]   One of the questions was, it was inconsistent on whether the point was that they lost its way
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.100]   because it was trying to do what Steve Jobs wanted to do,
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.100]   or that it was trying to be different from the Steve Jobs game plan.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.100]   You know where...
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:47.100]   I'm excited about the idea that some cases Tim Cook is sort of unwinding some of that.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.100]   That's what I feel like is going on.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.100]   Because Steve Jobs did a lot of things that were great.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.100]   He did a lot of things that were questionable.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.100]   It was vindictive.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.100]   I didn't go in nuclear on the patent thing.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.100]   It was probably a mistake, and he just couldn't help himself.
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.100]   And I feel like this is a sign of...
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.100]   It was personal.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.100]   Of Tim Cook saying, "Let's back off.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.100]   This is crazy. Let's go un-nuclear.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.100]   Let's back it up."
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.100]   That's my take exactly.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.100]   You know, the book that actually is most germane to this is Dogfight,
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   which is how Apple and Google fought for years over this,
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.100]   and it talks about that.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.100]   And really, that's kind of the thing.
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:21.100]   One of the takeaways from Dogfight is, A, that Apple knew that it didn't invent slide to unlock.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:27.100]   This was an anti-competitive move as much as a global nuclear war against Google.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.100]   Sure.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.100]   It's cool, and we can stop you from using something cool.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.100]   Precisely.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.100]   Your product won't be as good.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.100]   Whether it's right or not, we think we can stop you and win this case.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.100]   So I think this is the right thing.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.100]   I agree with you.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.100]   I think maybe Tim Cook's saying, "Yeah, we honored Steve's memory,
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.100]   but I think it's time maybe to move."
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.100]   All of the secret stuff comes out in court and these documents.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.100]   We see Apple's behind the scenes stuff.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.100]   I mean, I don't see how this helps Apple, and even when Apple wins the case, right?
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:57.100]   It's a couple hundred million, which for Apple, honestly, they've got that in their couch cushions.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.300]   Well, even when they won a billion.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.500]   But now it seems like the awards are diminishing.
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   You agree, Tim?
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.500]   Yeah, I definitely agree.
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.180]   Especially in a case like this where we had kind of a split verdict basically where they
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.180]   both won it.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.020]   And obviously Apple won a lot more than Samsung did, but I think at this point, consumers
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.020]   didn't really see that.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:17.860]   They just saw that both companies won something, so therefore both companies are more or less
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.260]   as right or as wrong.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.940]   And so therefore there was no clear victory in the public's eye.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:26.060]   And they both lost because here they are both dragging themselves through the mud and
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.220]   dragging each other through the mud.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.980]   And I don't think anybody really cares anymore.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.420]   I don't think anybody's really that excited about the case anymore.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.860]   And I think the fact of it is really that it kind of shows that Apple is really, you
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:42.100]   know, feeling somewhat trying to think of a good way to say this.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.620]   Basically, they're still kind of bitter about how things went a long time ago, you know,
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.340]   the origins of the smartphone, the launch of the iPhone, and what happened four, five,
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.860]   six, seven years ago.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.020]   And really nobody cares about that anymore.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.940]   The industry's moved forward and so therefore these lawsuits I think are a bit of an an
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.940]   acronym at this point.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.140]   I think that it's good that they're going to be telling them down.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   I hope they do.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:08.580]   Here will be the real test because Mike, you remember a few years ago, the Nortell patents.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.940]   We're all sorry.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:18.100]   We're so and Google bid on them but lost to a consortium of companies, including Apple,
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.060]   Microsoft research in motion, the blackberry folks, Sony and Erickson.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:28.300]   It's called rock star and they have four thousand patents, which they've weaponized basically.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.820]   And now this will be the test.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.580]   This is the proofs in the pudding.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.060]   And the problem is it's not just Apple.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.060]   It's Microsoft.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.060]   It's rem it's Sony.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.060]   It's Erickson.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:42.260]   But if these guys put down their weapons and and stop going out because rock star really
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:47.900]   was created to to sue to get licensed fees for everything, including L2E3G.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.780]   It's come out out of this, you know, there's this whole industry of people buying patents
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.180]   and building up these war chests just in case something bad happens.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:00.120]   And you know, if the main protagonists in these legal battles start to back off and
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.660]   start to put down their weapons, does that mean this industry goes out of business?
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.580]   And if it does, are they going to go quietly into the night or are they going to, you know,
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.980]   lob their last Hail Mary charge and try to sue everybody and keep this fight going on?
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.980]   I'm I'm curious to see how that stands out too.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.420]   Googly I have to think Google is a chief target of rock star.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:24.220]   But in the statement that Apple and Google released over the Apple Motorola lawsuits,
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:28.220]   there is this sentence Apple and Google have also agreed to work together in some areas
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.780]   of patent reform.
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.220]   Maybe this means that they're going to kind of recognize that these these patent lawsuits
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.220]   are good for nobody.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.220]   They just slow down innovation.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.100]   They're only good for your sister.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.860]   Yeah, yeah, exactly right.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.980]   It's the light at the end of the tunnel and hope we're all hoping it is the end of the
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:50.020]   tunnel and not that on rushing train with a nuclear warhead strapped to it that we've
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.020]   been watching approach.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:56.460]   Hey, speaking of which, whatever happened, I thought we were going to be I really thought
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:01.620]   we were going to be running this tape from last week's show in which I said, I thought
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.020]   I was going to be eating my hat.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.740]   I said the Apple beats thing was a bogus rumor was never going to happen.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.340]   You want to play the tapes?
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.340]   Play the tape.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:15.740]   It was a rumor created by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine in an attempt to sell headphones and
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:21.500]   stock or whatever to drum up gin up some interest in a company that is actually failing.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.500]   Failing.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.500]   That's what I've got.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.340]   You actually took a good way too far.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.180]   Yeah, way too far.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.900]   Well, I don't I don't think anything happened.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.900]   Please wait.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.900]   Still buffering, still living.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.500]   Is it dead or is it?
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.660]   See, I think it was a bogus.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.660]   I know I feel like it was a bogus rumor.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.460]   Maybe they're maybe they're negotiating something.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.940]   Maybe they want to put Beats headphones in the next iPhone, but I don't think that Apple
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.460]   wanted to buy Beats for $3.2 billion.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.340]   That makes absolutely no sense.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.340]   I think it was a bogus.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.340]   You're looking.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.340]   I don't know.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.620]   I mean, I can see reasons why they would do it and they've got the money for it.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:02.700]   I don't think it's the entire tech journalism industry got sucked into this ridiculous rumor
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.580]   and just said, huh, and then they just bought into it.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.580]   Hook line and sinker.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.420]   Tim, you think I'm right or is, you know, I could be wrong tomorrow.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.260]   They could make the announcement tomorrow.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.380]   I think the truth lies somewhere in between.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:20.980]   I do think that that probably the acquisition is likely, but I was very, very nauseous
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.700]   at the way that the tech industry or the tech journalism industry in general reported on.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.780]   I mean, it was pretty much it's confirmed even just basically it was far from confirmed.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.540]   You know, I don't think we'll hear anything about it until WWDC if we hear about it at
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.540]   all.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.980]   But yeah, I mean, I think it's probably happening.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.660]   The question is why is it happening?
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:43.060]   And that's, you know, a broader question with some perhaps unsavory implications there.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.860]   You know, it depends on whether they're trying to buy a culture or they're trying to buy
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.420]   technology and if it's a technology grade, if they're trying to buy, if it's more of
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.460]   a cultural attitude change that they're trying to acquire.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.980]   That's a little bit more of a concerning acquisition.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.460]   But, you know, it remains to be seen exactly what the intent is here.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.620]   And if we indeed we will see, you know, beats your buds in the next gen iPhone.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.620]   Who knows?
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:10.580]   Peter Kafka at Recode says, Oh, it turns out it might not happen till next week.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:16.540]   I think I've seen a couple of, you know, day 53 beats held hostage.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.980]   I think this is going to, this is never going to constimate.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.980]   I just, I can't believe this was even, or even people even considered this as a real
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.980]   story.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.060]   I wonder if that tweet actually affected the deal somehow.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:34.860]   I mean, Dr. Dre's video that he says, I'm the first rap billionaire that he pulled down
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.860]   immediately.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.580]   I hope he hasn't started buying stuff.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.580]   He did.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.060]   He bought Tom Brady's house for $40 million.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.060]   Great.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   Hold it together.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   It's in LA.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.940]   It has a moat around it.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.980]   We were thinking of building a moat around the broadcast studios.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.980]   I think it'd be good.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.980]   I mean, if you can have a moat, why not?
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   Law the port colors.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.340]   So Jason Snell is here.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.340]   City Petaluma might have some issues.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.340]   I love it.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:09.660]   Boiling oil on the roof in case revision three assaults us.
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.660]   Google glass worth $152.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.060]   According to IHS, that's the materials list.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.060]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.100]   $1500 if you've got the money to buy them.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.340]   Now you can.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.980]   You're running out to buy glass?
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.420]   No, I think it's funny that first they did that one day sale.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.220]   It was like, anybody can buy it if you want.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.220]   If only we have enough.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.900]   And then they're like, yeah, actually, we still have some.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.580]   So you can still.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.580]   You can just.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.740]   Google.com/glass.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.500]   You can become an explorer.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.020]   Yeah, it's still the developer edition.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.940]   I think that's the issue here is there will probably be a consumer-ish version.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.580]   I mean, skepticism about glass aside.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:54.500]   I'm not sure any regular person should buy the developer edition of glass.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.020]   It doesn't seem like a good idea.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.020]   Let's see.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.020]   I can choose some sunglasses.
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.020]   I could choose my color.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.020]   I'm going to get tangerine.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.220]   I can't add it to the cart.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.220]   What's going on?
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.220]   I have to.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.220]   Oh, it's already in my cart.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.420]   Apparently I've already gone through this process.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.020]   It's already on the way to your home.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.020]   Oh, damn.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.020]   Let's see.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.340]   I first have to agree to the terms of sale.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   Click buy with Google.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.220]   See if they didn't even ask who I am.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.460]   It knows.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.460]   It knows.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:24.420]   I'm apparently buying two of them now.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:32.900]   Again, I'm starting to feel like an old man, but this is another dumb idea.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.900]   Who wants glass?
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.620]   Anybody wearing glass here?
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.220]   Any of you glass explorers in our audience?
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.220]   I was.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.220]   You were?
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.220]   What happened to your glass?
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.220]   I was.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.220]   That was complicated.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:47.500]   But that was part of the engadget thing.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.860]   I think sitting in a closet still merited well.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.140]   In the divorce they kept the glass?
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.140]   Oh, man.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.140]   So that's something.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.940]   I'm the dogs.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.940]   You got the dogs?
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.940]   Okay.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.940]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.940]   It's a great product.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.100]   If you've got a lot of disposable income and you wanted to feel something really futuristic,
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.100]   glass is pretty cool.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.300]   But yeah, I just don't see it as a consumer product yet.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.500]   I think that'll change in the not too distant future.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.820]   I wouldn't be surprised if we see a lot of cool stuff at I/O here at the end of June.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.740]   But the version that we're saying now, the Adelek you guys just mentioned, that's a developer
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.740]   edition.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.940]   It's not really ready for prime time.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.940]   It's still pretty fragile.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.180]   The battery life still isn't great.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.420]   It's still not a ton of functionality.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.580]   But again, if you've got $1,500 a burn in a hole in your product and you want to really
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:33.460]   feel something that's significantly different from any of the piece of technology that you
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.340]   bought in a long time, you can know and blow your money in worse ways, I suppose.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.140]   You just punched in the nose in San Francisco, but it's cool.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.140]   Yeah, I'm at too.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.660]   All right, word coming from a variety of a big acquisition in the tech industry.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.260]   Don't show that.
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.420]   I was going to tease people.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.420]   Spoilers.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.740]   No spoilers.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:37:01.180]   When we come back and talk about it, this is a Twitch with Jason Snell, Tim Stevens.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.180]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.020]   I showed it a brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.020]   Shutterstock.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:13.500]   I love going to Shutterstock and seeing what the count is of the number of images, royalty-free
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   images on Shutterstock.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.380]   It goes up all the time.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:26.660]   The total now, 37,129,198 royalty-free stock images.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.900]   This week, they added more than a quarter million alone.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.620]   These are high quality photos, illustrations, vectors and video clips.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.860]   Those are them shot by professional photographers, created by professional artists, each of
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.740]   them reviewed for content and quality.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.500]   When you have that many images, it's important that you have a good search engine.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.540]   Shutterstock has the best I've ever used.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:54.900]   Search for nouns like babies, but then you can search for adjectives like dogs.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.900]   Okay.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.740]   You said nouns and I was going for the nouns.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.060]   Babies but dogs is fine.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.060]   They have the nouns.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   Search for sleeping or happy.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.700]   All right, we're at it.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.700]   Good baby dogs.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.700]   Chad and I are out of sync.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.700]   A little bit.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.700]   Happy.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.260]   These are all happy dogs.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.300]   Can you find sad dogs?
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.340]   Why would you want to do that?
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.260]   Well, maybe you're writing a blog post about an unhappy...
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.260]   Sometimes dogs are sad.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.260]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.260]   That's very sad.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.260]   Yeah, look, that's a bad sign.
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.260]   Oh my God, those are the saddest dogs I've ever seen.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.700]   So there's a dog with a bindle.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.780]   He's running away from home.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.780]   Oh my God.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.780]   A heart pillow.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.780]   Oh.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.860]   This is a little doggy with a heart.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.580]   All right, see, this is beautiful.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.060]   So if you've got an idea, yeah, we have a sad dog because I accidentally told the groomer
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.740]   to shave Aussie and he doesn't...
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.100]   He's an unhappy Aussie, I got to tell you.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:56.500]   So if you are a blogger, if you're a journalist, if you need images, it's a great place to go.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.140]   By the way, you can create an account.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.780]   You don't have to give him a credit card.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.260]   Do all the searches you want.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.620]   You can even store search results in the light box.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:09.220]   Share them with colleagues and clients or just keep the images around for inspiration.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.140]   You don't have to pay till you buy and you can buy individual image packs.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.820]   But I have and I like the monthly subscription.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.980]   We have the 25 images a day.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.580]   That's the standard subscription.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.180]   Great for a publication.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.300]   You can download any image in any size and pay one price.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.780]   Great search tools, light boxes.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.780]   Oh, I know what I mentioned.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:32.980]   They have great apps too and Webby Award winning iPad app now on Android as well.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.860]   Those apps are just beautiful images that you can just browse and look at.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.500]   I love that too.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:45.460]   Another way, if you're on a sales call, you can show some ideas for images.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:51.020]   Multilingual customer support and more than a dozen countries, full-time customer service
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.780]   throughout the week.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.020]   Shutter stock, I got to tell you.
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.260]   It's the best.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.260]   Try it right now.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.360]   Sign up for that free account.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.360]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.420]   But if you decide to buy, do me a favor.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:05.580]   Use the offer code TWIT 514 and new accounts will get 20% off on any package.
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.420]   That's why the subscription is such a deal.
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.420]   20% off.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:12.420]   But you have to use the offer code TWIT 514 since we're in May 2014.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.420]   That's TWIT.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.260]   Oh, that's a happy dog.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:23.500]   They have video without the channels.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.500]   Man, it's like teleported.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.100]   What the heck was that?
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.440]   So that's kind of fun because we can use that in our green screen.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.320]   You just do that right from the site, right, Chad?
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:38.560]   Yeah, I went to their footage area and they have a lot of green screen, premade great green
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.560]   screen footage.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.720]   There's a little puppy on our desk.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.920]   And you can make them grow.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.760]   Oh my gosh.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.680]   Oh my gosh.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:56.520]   Tim, come back, Tim.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   I'm scared.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.940]   Those are you listening at home.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:05.760]   You're not missing anything.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.680]   And then we can make him disappear.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   Amazing.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.640]   Shadowstock.com, you see offer code TWIT 514.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.360]   So this just coming across the wire.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360]   This is hot news.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:21.240]   YouTube, according to variety set to buy Twitch for $1 billion.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   They're going rate for anything.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.600]   It's a billion for anything now.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.440]   Dr. Evil has set this one race.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.200]   Smaller forms of currency.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   That's a good deal actually.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.520]   Twitch TV, which is created by Justin TV, is the network.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:37.280]   I watch it all the time that has video game play and they have some real stars on there
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.520]   who are doing a great job.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.960]   In fact, that's the number one category on YouTube itself, right?
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.520]   Pewdiepie and people like that.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.520]   You know, it's funny.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.360]   I've come to the realization.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.720]   Sorry, I'm injecting here.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.720]   Chad Johnson, who is a YouTube expert because he's under 25.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   Right.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.480]   I've come to the realization that YouTube might be the best place.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.520]   The only content that really survives on YouTube might be gaming.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.320]   And that's why I just seen and everyone has a gaming channel.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.400]   Everybody's moving to gaming.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:11.160]   And the reason is because it's so monetizable because you can do the only real way to make
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:18.200]   a good salary on YouTube is to not only do, you know, like, you can't make a good salary
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.480]   off of one video a week.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.160]   The best way to do it is three videos a day because no matter what video you put out,
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.240]   you're going to get a certain amount of views.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.000]   So if you do one video a week, you'll get 100,000 views.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.880]   But if you do seven videos a week, you'll also get 100,000 views on those seven videos.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.360]   But now that's 100,000 times seven.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.280]   And that's the only way to get the ad revenue to a point where you can actually make money.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.520]   And the only content that is- You know, that's how it is in life.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.280]   If you work really hard, but the only content that you can really pump out that fast is
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   video game content.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.200]   Oh, I mean, video game content.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.640]   Well, I mean, there's people who do great and there's people who are very entertaining.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.000]   It's trash content, though.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   It's very- I think you're right.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.600]   I think that's the future of YouTube.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:07.120]   You know, Twitch.tv was clearly YouTube's biggest competitor in any space, right?
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.360]   I mean, there was no question about that.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.480]   It's wired into Xbox and PlayStation.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.840]   It's so great on the Xbox.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.320]   In fact, Xbox launched- They launched Titanfall on a Twitch channel.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.240]   So yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.640]   I know what my kids are doing this summer.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.760]   I'm just going to have them make Minecraft videos the whole summer.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   That's the way to make some money.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   Forget a job.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.880]   You know, I wouldn't be surprised, frankly, if Microsoft was in the bidding for this.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.360]   In fact, this might have been a miss on their part.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.360]   A pretty big miss.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.840]   I mean, that's definitely a big opportunity with next generation consoles, a streaming
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.440]   video right from the system.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.840]   And yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft was definitely in the game.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.840]   Or Sony, right?
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:50.200]   That seems like they should, you know, according to this story, YouTube is preparing for US
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.600]   regulators to challenge the deal.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.640]   YouTube's number one for internet video, but Twitch is right up there.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.880]   And I think that it's probably the case that if you have both of them, there's not much
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.760]   competition.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.680]   The startup going for a billion raised 35 million in funding.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:15.360]   So a big payday for their venture capital partners.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:22.440]   So let's see in March of this year, Twitch represented 1.35% of all downstream bandwidth.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.520]   Tripling, tripling since last fall.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.920]   So big growth curve.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:35.040]   Again, this is from Variety, not confirmed yet by other sources, but Todd Spangler is
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.600]   pretty well connected, I believe.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.600]   No, it's a big deal.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.600]   Tweeted about it yet.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.600]   Not yet.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   It's a big deal.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.800]   My kids, Justin Kahn, I am the first internet billionaire.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.400]   My kids don't watch TV.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.600]   They watch Minecraft videos on YouTube.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   That's what they do.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.200]   That's their programming of choice.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:56.800]   You know, they've ripped through the entire Twit, you to Minecraft show archive.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   They watch Chad.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   They watch Chad.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   Absolutely.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.800]   They know who Chad is.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   Right on Chad.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   But that, you know, they can't stop.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.680]   There's so many of those videos and there are thousands more videos to watch.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.680]   How old are they?
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.680]   12 and 9.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:13.960]   Yeah, Michael's 11 and that's all he watches is video game videos day in, day out all the
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   time.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.120]   He rarely watches TV.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.960]   I can't think of him watching TV at all.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.760]   Yeah, so we watch trying to get him to watch cosmos.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.600]   We watch Gilligan's Island and stuff like that to waste away hours as children.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.880]   Well, it's Minecraft videos now.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.880]   That's what it is.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.080]   Another video game videos when they get a little older.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.560]   That's worse.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.560]   Actually.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.560]   Wow.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   Wow.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.560]   There you go.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.400]   That's a good move on YouTube's part.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:42.280]   And I think they caught Microsoft asleep at the switch again on that one.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.080]   Let's see.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.880]   A lot of acquisitions.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.880]   This is acquisition week.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.800]   And what's up with the Sunday night stuff?
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.480]   I mean, we have a hard time thinking of days.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   Well, why are they doing this on Sundays?
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   It's got to be Sundays.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   We're going to be writing up acquisition stories too.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.720]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.360]   You Google acquired word lens.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.560]   They did this during the week.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.640]   Thank you, Google.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.480]   This was a very cool app that was I really kind of had a lot of profile on the iPhone.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.120]   They didn't have an Android version.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.320]   But I remember when it came out on the iPhone, it lets you hold up the camera, pointed at
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.560]   a foreign language sign.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   Totally works.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.560]   And it translated.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.560]   It was the coolest thing ever.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   It's like ever.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.560]   It's amazing.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.200]   And it had been featured, actually, in Apple's ads.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.000]   Well, I guess you won't see it anymore.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.840]   Apple ads because Google has purchased Quest Visual, the company behind word lens.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.600]   They say they're going to fold it into Google Translate, which Google Translate is a great
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.600]   product.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.760]   I think that is a killer product.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.520]   Google Glass too is a natural fit.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.080]   And in fact, I think Translate is built in it.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.600]   Word lens should be in there.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.200]   Absolutely.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:48.600]   It was featured in Apple's latest iPhone ad, also listed on the ads microsite.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.520]   And I know this stuff can get over hyped, but word lens, for me, it met the hype that
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.440]   you hold your phone up, your camera to a sign.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.200]   I did this in Montreal with French signs.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.840]   I did this in Barcelona with Spanish and Catalan signs.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.840]   Amazing.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.200]   And it tries to match the font.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   And it looks like the same sign.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.320]   Suddenly translated into English.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   Wild.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.240]   I understand why Apple put it in the ads.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.840]   It's one of the things you show people when you say, "You see, this is where technology
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   is ending.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.400]   It is like the Babel fish that you stick in your ear."
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.080]   And Google Translate, you know, actually speaks.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.800]   So when we were in Italy, for instance, you could say something to it, say, you know,
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.120]   can you ask where the museum is?
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.000]   And it will say, "I told you, I'm Jose," or whatever.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   In Museo.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.720]   It doesn't do the hand gestures, though.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.840]   No, you have to do those yourself.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.160]   We watched before we went to Italy, we watched YouTube videos and Italian hand gestures to
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.440]   make sure we did the right ones.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.440]   Right.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.440]   Right.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.480]   It's a lot of them do the wrong ones.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.880]   Eric Schmitz and Trumbull with the governor, I guess I did this last week.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.360]   Didn't I do this last week?
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.080]   The governor's office in New York, apparently, Eric is executive chairman of Google, is on
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:04.040]   a commission appointed by the governor of New York City to offer thoughts on the use
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.240]   of technology in schools.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.760]   And I guess the consumer watchdog, group consumer watchdog feels like he might just say, "Get
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.560]   chrome, boys."
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.440]   That's the end of it.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.080]   I think if you get somebody of Eric Schmitz stature on your commission, you should take
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.080]   him.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.120]   Presumably he would have enough classes, acknowledge that there's other choices behind besides
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   Chromebooks.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:34.560]   Do, do, do, do, do.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.800]   Norway says iCloud is illegal.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.880]   Well, somebody had to say it.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.520]   It's about time.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   Broken.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   Yes.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.520]   Illegal?
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:52.680]   Well, Norway's consumer counsel says that Apple's iCloud, Yula, is convoluted and
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.000]   unclear.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.280]   Like it's worse than anybody else's, the iCloud agreement is particularly bad, says the consumer
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.280]   counsel.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.720]   More than 8,600 words.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:10.760]   It's also unreasonable and unilateral in its terms.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:16.280]   Apple, for instance, reserves the right to change the agreement without notice.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:21.200]   That's in violation of the Marketing Act.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.040]   In Mayor's Dad, the head of digital services at the Consumer Council said, "Cloud storage
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.480]   servers, services, rely on users trust and confidence.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:33.600]   The terms of iCloud undermine this."
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:38.440]   I think they'd have the same problems with a lot of these terms.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   The EU has also ruled that Google is going to have to enforce something called the right
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.600]   to be forgotten.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:55.200]   In a kind of stunning misunderstanding of how technology works, the EU says that Google,
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.800]   if somebody doesn't like something that the Google search shows up, they have the right
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.960]   to go to Google and get it taken down.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:11.440]   The European violation, I guess of European privacy laws, but it seems like Google is
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.120]   saying, "Hey, look, we're at index of what's on the Internet.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:20.240]   You're going to have to go to the site that published this information to take it down."
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.800]   The European Union says, "Well, you don't have to take it down on the site.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.040]   Just take it out of the search index.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.320]   Nobody will find it anyway."
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.360]   The laws are different in the US than in Europe, but I find this really offensive because
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.200]   I've gotten notes from people who we've written things about embarrassing things they said
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.440]   or did in the past and they're like, "Hey, the good ones are, wow, I was a kid.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.440]   That was five years ago.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.440]   I'm really embarrassed.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.440]   I'm going to take that down."
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.840]   I usually will obscure their name or something just to be nice, but there are other people
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.520]   who are like their lawyer sends a note saying, "You need to take this down," which is totally
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.880]   not something we actually need to do.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.480]   That's what troubles me about this is that somebody who's using reputation.com or something
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:06.400]   like that is going to want to get some bad review or something about a legal case disappeared
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.400]   from the Internet.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.800]   It might still be on my server and my reporting on it is completely legitimate, but they've
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:17.240]   gone to the search engines and gotten my URL blocked because they feel bad about it, which
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.600]   doesn't seem like an acceptable ... It doesn't work, right?
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.400]   Like you said, this is not how the Internet works.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:29.600]   The case came about because a guy in Spain wanted Google's reference to a legal notice
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:35.360]   that appeared in Barcelona newspaper about his home's repossession and auction in 1998
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.520]   eliminated.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:40.600]   Not that the repossession and auction didn't happen, but they had been resolved for a
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.800]   number of years and it's entirely irrelevant.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:49.000]   He asked that the notices be removed from Google's index as well as from the newspapers
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   website.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.800]   Google responded with a list of things that people have asked Google to remove.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   - Gullbladder appendix.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   - Yeah.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.400]   An individual who tried to kill his family asked that a link to the news article about
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.760]   the event be removed.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.120]   An actor who wants articles about an affair he had with a teenager removed, a convicted
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:13.000]   cyberstalker mentioned in an article about cyberstocking laws requested that links to
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.960]   that article be removed.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:20.760]   A man could have a physician requested that links to a review site about him that were
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.400]   apparently not very complimentary be reviewed.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.800]   - Put it down the memory hole, right?
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   It's 1984.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:30.960]   - Hey, a former politician requested links to a news article about his misbehavior when
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.880]   he was previously in office be removed because he wants to run again.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:40.680]   - These facts are very troubling and they get in the way of...
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.480]   - And there are other implications too.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.800]   I mean, there's a DJ in the UK named Tiger Tim Stevens.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.480]   If you Google Tim Stevens, you'll find some stuff about me and some stuff about him.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.560]   Could I file a request to Google to take down the stuff about him just so that my results
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.040]   show up in a better position in the search results?
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.640]   How would Google know which results to block and which not?
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.600]   I think that's an interesting implication here that I don't know if that was considered
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.600]   by the quarter now.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.800]   Apparently, Google's going to comply.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.600]   They say this is logistically complicated, not least because of the many languages involved
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.360]   in the need for review of each request.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   As soon as we thought through exactly how this will work, which may take several weeks,
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.720]   we'll let our users know.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:23.000]   Apparently the thought is they'll implement some sort of automated system.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.480]   - So is the internet going to become like Snapchat in Europe?
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.400]   Is the internet expires after 10 years?
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   That's just sorry.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.400]   - Well, maybe that's a good idea.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.160]   Anything that's that old, just remove it.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.160]   I don't know.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:41.680]   The problem is that these people aren't asking for stuff to be removed that's false or malicious
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   or libelous.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   They just don't like it.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.240]   - Yeah, that's the best way to agree.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.680]   - I get the impulse and a lot of it is innocent, right?
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.200]   A lot of it is I did something stupid 10 years ago.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.520]   - Yeah, and I get it to stick with me forever.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.520]   That's reasonable for you to honor that request.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.520]   - Right, right.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:02.760]   But to go to Google and have them make it just disappear while the content still exists
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.840]   on the internet potentially, that's bizarre.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.960]   And also I worry about this being misused, right?
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:14.440]   Where people are hiding legitimate things that people should probably know because they,
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.840]   you know, it's bad for them.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:18.520]   It's bad for their reputation, even though it's true.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.520]   - Yeah.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   - Yeah.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.840]   - You hit the nail on the head.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:22.840]   It's 1984.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:28.320]   - It's not like there aren't teenagers today who are going to regret things they put on the
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.320]   internet.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.280]   - Well, that's the thing I have some sympathy for that.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   - Totally.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.840]   - I have stuff, there's stuff online about me I wish I could have taken down.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.320]   - Oh my God, there are posts on Recart Star Trek.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.720]   Don't look them up that I wrote in college that are, I disavow all knowledge of those
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.640]   reviews of Star Trek the next generation.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.480]   I had nothing to do with them.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.600]   - Really bad series of fiction stories I wrote for an Atari magazine.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   - There you go.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.000]   - Every time I mention it, somebody dredges it up and pays someone to the chat room.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   - I know.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   - Google.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   - I'm gonna do that right now actually.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   - Stop it.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Google.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.240]   - I have a right for my bad writing to be forgotten.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.840]   - No, there's serious issues here where people have been involved in things maybe as minors
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.040]   or a long time ago.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.840]   I totally get that, but it just seems so bizarre that this would be like this.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.840]   We have laughter.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.880]   You've calling up the Star Trek post now?
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.880]   - What?
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.880]   - What?
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.880]   Somebody in the chat room put the link in?
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.880]   - Probably.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.880]   - Great.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   Thanks.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.480]   - Yeah, anyway, you know, it's weird that the government is the one that's telling us.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.880]   - Oh, so many of the chat rooms said could you elaborate on more of the things you'd
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   like to have removed?
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.880]   Let's have a better list.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.640]   - Hey, I just did a little searching on the terms of service story of the last one.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   The word count on the Google Drive terms of service is 2000.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.040]   So the iCloud one is about a five times larger.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.800]   - That's a pretty legitimate component.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.160]   - Nobody's gonna, who is gonna read an 8,000 word terms of service?
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.680]   - Or even 2000 for that matter.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.000]   - You can have it mailed to you.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   I love that.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.240]   That's the new thing Apple does.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:56.080]   Would you like to read this or would you want to have us mail it to you?
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.360]   Oh, yeah, I'll read that in my leisure time later.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.840]   It'd be some light reading.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.120]   - The truth about a lot of those terms of service documents is that nobody reads them.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.400]   In fact, the lawyers often will take terms of service from some comparable site and just
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   copy and paste it and do a search and replace.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.360]   And so you end up with some, if you really carefully read them, some of the weirdest
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:19.160]   contradictory nonsensical stuff because the lawyers don't even want to work on them.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.320]   - So Roscoe has now posted that stupid article.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.320]   Thank you, Roscoe.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.320]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.320]   It's our magazine.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.640]   - I want the right to be forgotten.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.400]   - Our show today, don't forget this, brought to you by our friends at Citrix and the great
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.760]   go to meeting.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.160]   Not all meetings can be planned in advance.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:41.520]   Things come up last minute opportunities, work emergencies, great ideas to discuss.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.280]   But nowadays everybody in the office is spread out.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.440]   People are on the go.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.640]   You've got offices in many cases all over the world.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.520]   It's impossible to get everyone in the same room.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.400]   But with go to meeting, you can get everyone in the meeting instantly.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:59.120]   It's a powerfully easy and simple way to meet and collaborate online whenever you need to.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.120]   You are.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:04.760]   You can even video conference with go to meeting over an iPad.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.640]   You can present from an iPad.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.480]   They've got iPad, iPhone and Android apps.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.000]   With their face-to-face webcam sharing, that's really great.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.120]   They've got beautiful HD webcams.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.000]   You can have them kind of as a frame around the document.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.800]   You're all looking at the presentation or the spreadsheet or the...
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.120]   I mean, it's just really great.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:28.360]   It saves you time and money and lets you work smarter because you pay one low flat rate for
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:32.360]   a month of use as many calls as you want, as many meetings as you want for as long as
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.360]   you want.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.760]   I know people use go to meeting just keep it on all day long.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.320]   Try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.440]   Just visit go to meeting.com.

[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.440]   We use go to meeting all the time here.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.440]   And love it.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.680]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.840]   Just make sure you use the offer code TWIT.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:55.520]   By the way, your attendees do not have to sign up for go to meeting.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.840]   They can be on max PC's, iPads, iPhones, Android.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   They don't have to sign up.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:05.320]   I hurt my back and was laying flat when I was supposed to be in a meeting and I just opened
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:09.960]   it on my iPad and it was multi-video plus the presentation all there.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.960]   It was kind of...
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.960]   All I had to do was tap a link.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   It was a minute.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.560]   It spoils you a little bit because then you go, "Why am I going to work?"
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.360]   I used to be flat on my back all the time.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.360]   All the time.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   All the time.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.360]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:24.960]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.280]   I love this because Moto...
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.880]   This is a little bit of a Sophie's Choice question.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.760]   A little philosophical question.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:38.360]   Should your driverless car kill you to save two other people?
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.760]   This is like the Asimov's law of robots applied to cars.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:46.160]   This popular science, "A front tire blows.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.960]   Your autonomous SUV swerves.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:53.400]   But rather than veering left into the opposing lane of traffic, that would be dumb.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.160]   The robotic vehicle steers right.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.520]   Brakes engage the system, tries to correct itself, but there's too much momentum.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:05.160]   Like a cornball stunt in a bad action movie, you are over the cliff in free fall.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.880]   Your robot, the one you paid good money for, has chosen to kill you rather than potentially
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.080]   kill others in the other lane."
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:19.360]   I want my robot to deploy the parachute out of the back.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   Who did it?
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.760]   Did the robot itself know?
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.440]   The programmer who wrote it, perhaps.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.280]   The executive had told the program, "This is the policy.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:32.480]   Maybe it's in the law."
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:42.320]   As Patrick Lin asked and wired, "When faced with a choice of hitting two cars or no cars,
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.640]   any robot's going to do the right thing and it might kill you."
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:49.520]   The robots are going to kill us all anyway.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.900]   These self-driving cars right now, at least, are really just trying to avoid accidents
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.400]   at all costs.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.600]   Whether or not it saves you or kills 20 other people, they're not making those decisions
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   yet.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.360]   But certainly you can imagine a future where with vehicle to vehicle communications, each
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.960]   car will know how many occupants are in it and they could communicate that information
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.760]   back and forth in theory.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.320]   So if indeed there were unavoidable accidents, you could imagine a sort of negotiation and
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.840]   bartering going on between the two cars to debate.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.480]   Which one should be the one that is in front of the…
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   This one.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.160]   Finally, a use for that baby on board side.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.400]   Noah Goodall, research scientist at the Virginia Center for Transportation Innovation and Research,
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.720]   says, "Imagine your car, your autonomous vehicle is facing an imminent crash.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.320]   It can either hit a motorcyclist who is wearing a helmet or one who is not.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.200]   It should hit the one with a helmet.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.520]   Or should it make that decision?"
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.240]   Is it illegal to wear it, not wear a helmet?
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.840]   Maybe it's in the space.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.440]   You probably would want to program the car to hit the person who is best likely to survive
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   the collision.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.720]   Noah Goodall It's hard to imagine that situation actually
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.720]   panning out.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   Noah Good for anybody.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   Noah Goodall.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720]   Noah Goodall.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.720]   Noah As a person who rides a motorcycle, it's hard to imagine.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.520]   Noah Do you write that algorithm in or you just say just try to avoid hitting anything
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.960]   if you hit something well there you go.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.120]   Noah I mean that's the thing.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.720]   These systems are all very much being trained manually.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.640]   It's not like there's a sort of neural network where they're just throwing them on the road
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.880]   and they're sort of figuring it out.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.960]   Developers are going in, by instance, in a situation where a situation is saying, "Okay,
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.240]   you see this bicycle on the side of the road, therefore you need to move to the left.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:23.680]   You know, 18 inches or 36 inches or whatever the state regulation is to give him that additional
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.800]   amount of room before you pass them."
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.600]   That's something that is explicitly hard-coded by an engineer at this point.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.480]   So the engineer would have to go in and say, "Is this guy working hell with it?"
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   "Yes, no."
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.840]   And you can imagine a million different permutations that would come into play before they would
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.040]   actually think to write that one thing.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.120]   So I would say that we may someday get to a point where cars are actually making those
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.120]   sorts of decisions.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.720]   I think we're a long, long way before we get there.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.880]   One thing Patrick Lin proposes in his Wired Magazine article is a random number generator
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.880]   to randomly pick.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.800]   I was going to say roll D&D dice.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   A 20-sided dice.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   A 2D10.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.640]   And see what happens.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.600]   I mean, I think it's an interesting question.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.400]   I don't know what the right answer is.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.480]   We're actually going to talk about this tomorrow.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.400]   I can't wait for the science fiction short story that's about that topic.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.160]   It's very much that science fiction short story, isn't it?
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.960]   Future, moral, premise.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.960]   It's drawing a guy named McKinty.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.280]   Tim, we can't.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.680]   Tomorrow on, I'm actually really excited tomorrow on triangulation.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.040]   We're going to interview a guy named James Barrett who wrote a book called "Our Final
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.480]   Invention, Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era."
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.900]   And this is actually, we had a couple of interviews now on triangulation, which is our interview
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:40.320]   show about the idea that if we make smart machines, well, one guy said, "Hey, it's okay
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.320]   to make smart machines.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.600]   Just make sure they don't replicate."
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.360]   And that's what Barrett says is inevitably, they're going to start making themselves and
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.720]   you're going to create not just artificial intelligence, but artificial super intelligence.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:57.160]   And at that point, unless you explicitly program into each and every one of them respect for
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.400]   human life, they're just going to go, "Oh, screw those guys.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.360]   We're just going to run right over them."
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.720]   So that'll be a fun interview.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:10.040]   You did a thing on Volvo's self-driving car, Tim.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.520]   Yeah, I was in Sweden this week, actually.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.920]   Volvo's got a new program called Drive Me.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.520]   And they're one of the first to actually say, "When they're actually going to be selling
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.240]   self-driving cars, then it's 2017, they're going to have one under self-driving cars on
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.280]   the roads in their hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden."
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.800]   So I went out there this week to get a little bit of a sneak preview of the technology.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.200]   And it's interesting for a couple reasons.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.800]   One, they're saying specifically, "2017 is when we're going to be selling these cars."
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.080]   Whereas Google's saying, "We want to have some out there by 2017, but it's probably
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.080]   not realistic."
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.120]   Are the laws in Sweden such that they can do this?
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.920]   Yeah, they are.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.440]   And they're working very closely with the government of Gothenburg.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.160]   Because right now it's limited to that town and limited to specific roads.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.560]   Volvo's system is a little bit primitive compared to some of the other things that are out
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560]   there.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.600]   So they have to work with the local government to make sure that the lanes on the roads are
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.000]   painted correctly, for example.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.640]   And they need to have a vehicle to infrastructure, communication system, so that the city can
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.840]   say there's a right link closure at mile mark or whatever on the highway, that kind of thing.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.520]   So most of the things need to be in place.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.520]   Fun assignment.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.920]   I'm kind of jealous you got to go to go.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.920]   Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.680]   The other cool thing about the Volvo system is that it's built on technology that they
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.120]   already have in their cars.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.000]   If you look at the Google car that's got laser scanners on the roof and a bunch of other
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.400]   stuff too, the same thing before, now, and all the others.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.080]   But Volvo's actually got laser scanners built in their cars today and some other simple
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   stuff like that.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.360]   So it's actually based on technology they've already got out there.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.240]   They really just need to work on the artificial intelligent piece of the puzzle that's what's
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   missing right now.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.200]   So the cost in theory should be very low to add this to Volvo cars.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.480]   Whereas if you look at the system as that Mercedes and Audi and Nissan and everybody
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.680]   else are building on, they add a lot of sensors on the cars and aren't there now.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.040]   And those are as of now anyway, quite expensive.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.040]   Don't merge on.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.040]   You're merging on the freeway in this thing.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.040]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.040]   He's got his hands on the wheel.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.040]   Yes.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.040]   So the way it works now, you have to go to the roads that are designated.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.040]   Okay.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.040]   So you have to go to the front of the road and you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road and you have to go to the front of the road.

[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:25.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:28.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.

[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.040]   And you have to go to the front of the road.
