[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Hello everybody, Leo LaPorte here with a great panel.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   We have to discuss the week's tech news.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   In studio with me right now, the Acting Director of the United States Digital Service.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Actually, you're an administrator, not a director.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I don't know if that's a difference.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm no longer acting.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I'm very excited.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Oh, you're not acting anymore?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I'm not acting right off.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You mean you're no longer pretending to administer?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I'm a real boy.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yes.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   That cuts.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   That's great.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Well, let's fix your lower third and take that acting.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   We can edit that off right here right now.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's probably from the last time I was here.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   That's exactly what I was acting.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Do they night you?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   What do they do when they remove the acting?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's no longer a political appointee position.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I am a career assistant.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   The administrator position is just a career position.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You want to get the best technical person you can get as quickly as possible.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's a good match.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I think that's fantastic.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   USDS.gov.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   If you're interested in what they do, read all about it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   If you are looking for coders, people with technical skills.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Designers, engineers, product managers, we even need a technical recruiter or two.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And we even have like one technical recruiter position in San Francisco.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So you wouldn't have to move to DC.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Just put that out there.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   USDS.gov/join.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And what you'll be doing is helping government agencies modernize.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Well, very famously you took the VA website and made it usable.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Which was huge.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Healthcare.gov.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And so it started with healthcare.gov was launched.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It had been done by kind of a hodgepodge, a bunch of third party contractors.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And it was a mess.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And people in Silicon Valley said, "Can we help?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Can we just make this better?"
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Is that kind of how it started?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   That's exactly how it started.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And a lot of people decided to stay behind.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Did you, is that when you first got involved?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   So I was not there for the first healthcare.gov.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I started in 2016, so a couple of years later.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   So just to fill people in and weren't familiar, Matt was long, one of the early Google employees
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   and long time Googler, you probably know who he is if you're a webmaster because his webmaster videos are
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   still classics to this day.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Search engine optimization.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   We don't need to go into that.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Took us a badacle, which ended up being a departure and now work for the USDS.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Thank you for being here.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Great to be here.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Thank you for visiting our visitor to our This Week in Google show, along with...
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Tada, tada, tada, tada, tada, tada.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   The return of Gina Trappani.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Whoo!
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Trappani's a back.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I asked Gina before the show, "How do I pronounce your name?"
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Because for years, for whatever, five, six years you did this week in Google, I called you
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   "Japani."
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Yeah, I think it was the last episode you said, "Oh, by the way, Leo, it's Trappani."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It was...
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It was...
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   It Italy, it's not been eaten.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   No, I would have told you a lot sooner.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Oh, sweet God.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Years we did twig together, Leo.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Anyway, however you pronounce it, I say it's great.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Gina, of course, one of the founders of Life Hacker.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   For many years, a host on one of our shows, we miss her dearly.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Time to Time comes back here and on "Elle about Android," and I hope we can get you back on
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   twig.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Unless you're avoiding Jeff Jarvis, I don't know.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   No, not at all.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   No.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It's because it's during the business day, and my day is just like meeting, so it's been hard
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   for me to get back on twig, but it's just so great to be here.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And I miss you all.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I love doing the shows.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And your daughter's now six, you told me?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I can't even move on to that.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Six years old, first grade.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Gina's a managing partner at a company called Postlight, which is like a code for hire group,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   right?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   We're a digital product studio.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.400]   When we build apps and websites and kind of big, we try to shoot for those big transactional
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.000]   digital platform products that power lots of different products.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   So we're here in New York City.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   We've worked with clients like Vice and like Bloomberg.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   We just recently rebuilt Audubon Society's Bird Watching app for both Android and iOS.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You can get those in the app stores now.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It's been a lot of fun.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Do you get to get your hands dirty in code?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   You know, I up until about March of last year, I was an engineer on the team and allocated
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   to projects.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   In fact, I helped build out the player's Tribune, which is one of our clients, Derek Jeter,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   and Colby Bryant's sports site.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I got to a point where, you know, my partners were saying to me, you know, like you really,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.240]   we really could use you in the room with clients and with prospects and can you help us go
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   about new projects?
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.960]   So I'm not pushing code on a daily basis anymore, which has been a weird transition.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.640]   But I really just, I get to spend a lot of my time talking to people about their problems
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.720]   and what they want to build and why they want to build it.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.600]   Sometimes they work with us and sometimes they go with someone else or they take it internally,
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.720]   but I really enjoy just being at that level, solving at that altitude.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.240]   We're thrilled that you could be here.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.680]   Also joining us, another guy who's been with our network for so long, Dwight Silverman
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.120]   of the Houston Chronicle, he actually took a hiatus for tech for a couple of years, but
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   you're back.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   For a little bit.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   Yep.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120]   But I'm back.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.640]   I'm doing my primary job is managing the websites for our business department.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.880]   And I also still manage the tech burger with, which is our technology site.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.360]   And that story there, I bought a new car and when I shot for cars, I like to review the
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   tech.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.280]   And so that's what I did with this particular one.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.000]   That car is awesome.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   The Toyota CHR.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Is that a crossover?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.920]   It's not a crossover.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   What is it?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.040]   Yes, it's not very well known.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.680]   In Europe, it's really popular.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   It's only been here for two years.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.280]   You look at it and you go, that's a Toyota.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.520]   And because it's really, it's like actually sexy.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.000]   And the idea that I would drive a car like that is just kind of like blows my mind because
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.920]   I had a Corolla before.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.360]   Always a Toyota man.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.280]   Sexy opposite of sexy.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.080]   Did you ever consider electric?
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   You know, I looked at it.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.160]   I live, I bought a condo here in Houston.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.080]   And that's a problem, right?
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.920]   Because if you don't have a charger in the parking garage, right, you're out of line.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.000]   There's no charge it.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.040]   And so I looked at it.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.640]   And when I started out shopping, I was looking at cars that were inexpensive but fairly technically
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   loaded.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.000]   And I looked at the Honda inside.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I looked at the Prius.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.640]   I looked at the new Jetta, which is a very nice car and has a full glass cockpit at
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.640]   the higher end trims.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:48.760]   And I spotted this when I was looking at another Corolla and said, "Oh, I need to drive that."
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.320]   And I drove it twice and fell in love with it and bought it.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.680]   And what's interesting, the most fascinating thing about it to me is that it has Apple
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.680]   CarPlay.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.960]   And there's a picture of it there in the story.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.400]   But usually when you have CarPlay, there's also Android Auto.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.080]   And there's no Android Auto on the Toyota.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   That's interesting.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.240]   You're going to introduce it next year.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.880]   But I'm dying to figure out why they even now.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.880]   Right?
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.120]   How do you not do that?
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:26.080]   So Dwight, I have to ask, does Toyota still use Bing as the search engine in the car?
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.480]   You know, I'm asking for a friend.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.360]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   Not there's anything wrong with that.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.920]   I just want to know what search engine your car uses is kind of a thing for some reason.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.680]   Does your car have a search engine?
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.680]   Toyota used to have Bing.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.680]   I don't know if they still do that.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.120]   How would you search?
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.480]   It uses like when you want to search for gas stations or you want it to.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.520]   But it doesn't do that.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.120]   I don't think now.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:57.640]   I haven't really played with the apps in Intune 3.0, which is their software, to the extent
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.680]   that I can tell where it's coming from.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.280]   And I think most people use what's on their phone.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.800]   And I assure you that Bing is not on my phone.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   You know.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.240]   I have to tell you that duck duck go.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.640]   I'm just asking for a friend.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.200]   So Matt, I haven't asked for you since you're doing this now.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:27.040]   My 89 year old mother who has in the past couple of months has had great reason to dig
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.400]   into the Social Security Administration Services.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.600]   Can you please do something to make the Social Security Administration's website friendly
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.240]   to people who are 90?
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.240]   Oh my goodness.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   That is such a great question.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.800]   So I will just say the CIO at the Social Security Administration, his name is Rajiv.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.560]   He came over from the IRS, has been doing a lot of stuff to try to improve the quality
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.680]   of the experience there.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.280]   And I would love to have enough folks where we could go over and help out over Social Security.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.040]   Do they have to approach the USDS and say we'd like some help?
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.720]   Or it's a little bit of a give and take because we have to decide how to allocate scarce resources,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.120]   you know, amongst areas where you can have the most impact.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.920]   But you know, if you look at SSA, they've got a big area.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.320]   They're a new unit and beneficiaries, you know, all federal employees, retirement.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.560]   So it's a very high impact administration.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.040]   So that's a...
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.440]   And it's also highly used by people who are much older and technologically challenged.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   Right.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.880]   And if you, if there was a way to take it, so, you know, someone who was not necessarily
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.720]   technologically astute could go in there and figure it out quickly and without a lot of
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.240]   hand holding, that would be a great benefit.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.240]   It is.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   It is the number one challenge.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.240]   It is your design.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.240]   It is hard.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   It is.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.840]   I'm actually on a, it's called a technology modernization board with Rajiv.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.560]   And so I see him about once or, you know, once a week or so.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.640]   So, you know, we'll have some stuff to talk about.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   Look at that.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   Talk about instantaneous results.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.640]   I know.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.040]   I'm mad on the, on the gunfire under Matt.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   The first five minutes.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   It's request filed.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.840]   And as soon as we're done here, I'll call mom.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   So I talked to somebody in the government, mother.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.120]   I'm going to have.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.720]   So I have a question for Matt.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.000]   There may be another shutdown on the way.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.840]   Have you gone around to all the federal government sites and said renew your certificates ahead
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.840]   of time?
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.560]   So, so there were something like 18 federal sites who certificates expired during the
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.280]   last shutdown, which meant they were insecure.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   Right.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.600]   In some cases, they were smart enough to say, no, you may not, no, shout, not pass.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.680]   In others, you would be asked to enter the site and enter insecurely, enter important
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   information.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   This was a big problem.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.680]   Well, as if it was unanticipated.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.520]   Well, and the crazy thing is that now you can set it up to auto renew and you can use
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.280]   things like Let's Encrypt.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.920]   So this doesn't have to happen.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.960]   The feds use Lesson Crypt.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.160]   It is possible to set those sorts of things up.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.960]   I would have thought you'd have to have, you know, a purchase or, you know, a special
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.680]   GPO and all that stuff.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.040]   It's always harder in government.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.240]   And like when I was at the Pentagon, Let's Encrypt didn't do dot mill.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.920]   And so, you know, you got to work out some of that.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.120]   But, but it is, you know, the government is catching up.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.600]   It's taking time, but the government is catching up.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.680]   So it is possible to set things up such that, you know, you know, just because you're not
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.400]   with hands on the keyboard, the certificate can get you.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.400]   It could automatically renew.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   That's right.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   So what do you think?
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.720]   If there's another shutdown, we're going to see a repeat or?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   We will see a repeat.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   It's not there yet.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.560]   People, they had three weeks, you know, to try to get ready.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.560]   It's not been a lot of time.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.160]   It's a little longer to get ready.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.280]   There's other stuff to do, imagine, in the interim.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.920]   Well, it's good to, geez, you know, we, this is nice.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.400]   We've got, we got some real experts on the panel today.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.960]   I almost feel like I should go pick some special stories, not just the usual run of
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   the mill stuff.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.440]   So let me, let me think here.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.640]   You, I wanted to ask, can you talk about Google these days, Matt, or do you have to
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.640]   recuse yourself?
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.400]   I have sold all of my Google shares.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   Wow.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   I'm winning the government.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.560]   So I can, you know, I'm not, as a government official, you can't endorse any specific, you
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.360]   know, product or company.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.120]   So got to be a little careful that way.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.280]   But I'm talking about Google.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.400]   So last this week, Google announced, actually, Alphabet announced its fourth quarter and fiscal
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.280]   year results.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.560]   And I'm glad to have your expertise here because the things that people always want to look
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.840]   at is not how much money Google made, what its revenue was, what its operating income
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.840]   was.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.920]   So, the cost per click.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.320]   And this is how Google ultimately makes most of its money is, you know, the cost per click.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.960]   And it's been dropping dramatically.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.880]   In fact, it did drop year over year 29%.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.000]   Is that, is that something Google worries about?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.360]   There's a lot of people at Google who pay attention to that, for sure.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.800]   But it's not just clicks on Google properties.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.120]   It's also clicks on the partners that Google pays.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.120]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   The thing that's--
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.520]   The cost per impression on Google network members' properties, non-group properties, has actually
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.520]   been going up.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   So that's good news, right?
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.160]   Well, it's-- there's a lot of different ways you could interpret things.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.320]   So for example, in the earnings, one thing that I thought was interesting is it looked
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.160]   like their capital expenditures were way up.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.040]   So a lot of people might be like, oh, if you're spending more money on your hardware,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   is that a bad thing?
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.000]   But sometimes that can be a leading indicator because people are saying, oh, we have a lot
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.520]   more stuff to do with our data center.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.720]   So we need to build or buy more machines.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   Right.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.800]   Is Google building new network operation centers at this time?
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   Do you know?
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.640]   They are always building out more infrastructure.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.280]   It's the infrastructure for Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon in particular.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.280]   Just kind of mind-boggling right of story today that Amazon owns more square footage.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   What was it?
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.920]   Was some huge number of square footage, mostly for fulfillment.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.920]   In fact, AWS is only about 10% of that.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.640]   Let's see if I can find that story.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.280]   I don't think it was on our run down because it just broke this morning.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.320]   Well, and there was a story in the rundown about Kashmir Hill who tried to remove the
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.800]   tech giants from her daily life.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.200]   And so many things were powered by AWS or various other technology companies that she
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200]   couldn't transfer a large file.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   That's an amazing story.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   Her podcast.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.640]   So actually, that's a good one to talk about.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.640]   Kashmir is great.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.840]   She's ready for Gizmodo now.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.600]   She said she wanted to try.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:30.200]   She'd been slowly going on a diet, slowly eliminating the big five from her daily life.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   But when she finally cut out all of them, she says it was hell.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.720]   She got a tame hacker to, I guess, install a blocker or whatever.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.800]   She bought a Purism laptop, which is a Linux Freedom First laptop, a Nokia feature phone
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.120]   because she can't buy iOS or Android.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.720]   The big five for her were Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.200]   She'd cut them out one at a time.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.800]   But in week six, she blocked them all.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.000]   So she had a network tool that would even go to the point.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.040]   Like she tried to use Dropbox, but Dropbox uses AWS.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.800]   So the network tool blocked Dropbox.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.400]   That's Amazon, not an Amazon company, but they use AWS.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.920]   Oh, and the Nokia phone is my favorite.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.000]   Isn't that a beautiful, that's a lovely one.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.800]   Well, and that was one of the problems, is she had to text using, do you remember folks?
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.520]   Do you want to type cat?
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:34.720]   You have to type one, one, one, pause, one, six, six, six, six, and then you'd get cat.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.640]   And then they had T9, which was a prediction service, which was terrible.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.640]   She didn't enjoy that apparently.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.440]   I'm impressed that she attempted this.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   Absolute performance.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.920]   So I can't imagine.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   It must have been absolute hell.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.960]   I mean, everything we touch every day goes to those big companies.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.160]   In ways you don't realize.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.880]   I mean, that's what I think the real important of this article is she couldn't listen to
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.560]   music in her car because she had a Ford sync system with the Microsoft car.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.120]   Tadda turned that off.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.440]   We are so dependent, and it's just five companies.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.600]   That's the thing that's really scary.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.720]   I don't mind being dependent on a hundred technology companies.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.400]   But when it boils down, actually, you probably could just say, you could probably take a
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:21.520]   couple of these out of there, like just say Google Amazon and Facebook, and it would still
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.680]   be almost impossible to use the internet, right?
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.040]   Particularly Amazon because of Amazon Web Services.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.440]   And Google has tried to live without Google.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   Right.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.440]   Right.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.440]   I think it would have been interesting.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.440]   She wanted to go from top to bottom on what she didn't use.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.120]   So she didn't want to use Amazon Web Services.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.840]   But what if you simply avoided their consumer facing products and if you had to go through
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.080]   pipes that they don't find, I wonder what kind of exercise that would be a lot easier.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   She was being very pure.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.440]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.880]   I use their sponsor, a product called Helm, which is a home email server.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.080]   It's a really clever idea, solves a lot of the problems.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.200]   But guess what?
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.160]   It runs everything through Amazon S3.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.920]   So I would have to stop.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.560]   She ended up using proton mail.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.960]   I think she's safe there because its servers are in a mountain in Switzerland.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   But yeah, Gina, you probably wouldn't have a job if you couldn't use those five.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.920]   I mean, we deploy everything for all of our clients, TAWS or Google Cloud.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:32.920]   Yeah, I mean, I'm sure even the other services like Heroku and all, and Linno and all, they're
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.880]   also using, like managed hosts also use in the background those services.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.760]   It would be a very, very default.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.800]   So is it Richard Stalman level crazy to say, let's just get rid of all this stuff?
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.080]   Or should we all be really concerned because we're so dependent on it now?
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.600]   Obviously it's not easy to get rid of it.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   I thought it was interesting that she saw the best and the worst.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.320]   Like on one hand, she tried to record audio and send it to a podcast and ended up having
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.680]   to use the dark web.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.680]   Right.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   Right.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.600]   She's nothing to use an onion, a tour based browser to share the file.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.200]   You couldn't even download the tool, had to like, arsenic it from someone else.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.920]   Oh, yes, she had to build the code from scratch.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   Okay.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:20.080]   But it does sound like by the end, she got to a more deliberate space where she said she
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.400]   didn't know what time it was because she doesn't use her phone all the time now and
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.520]   like more deliberate.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.400]   And using the technology as a tool instead of being, you know, in, in, in wound by it,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.800]   you know, cocooned by it is.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   That's something.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.600]   The Buddhist monk in, you know, vow of silence is in a much more quiet space too.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.800]   I'm not sure that the world.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.120]   Well, it's not even whether it's worth it.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   Can the world survive?
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.800]   I mean, you, you, this, in order to do this, you have to withdraw from the world.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.720]   I mean, that's really what you're doing.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.400]   And can we survive?
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.920]   I, I, I feel like I'm a little, I'm a little worried Dwight.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.240]   I feel like these companies have an immense amount of power now in our lives.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.640]   Well, if you, you know, the way we live, we live online.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.440]   We live with our smartphones.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.640]   You know, we're doing this podcast over the internet and when there's all kinds of products
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.480]   on, on this computer.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.560]   There are people in rural areas who use a lot less of it and live day to day just fine
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.400]   and they use, they, they don't necessarily rely on it as much.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.440]   But if you're all in on the 21st century and the way the 21st century works, as she showed,
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.040]   it's pretty much close to impossible.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:36.200]   I think you could spend a lot of time worrying about it, but you know, just use it.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:43.920]   What if I said, instead of the big five, let's take China out of our technology?
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.080]   Can you do that?
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.360]   No, this whole studio be shut down, right?
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.040]   Wasn't there a book someone tried to not buy anything made in China?
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.360]   And it was also a similar thing.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.000]   Like it was just, it was life, life was so much harder.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.600]   I mean, we're all interconnected and I mean, we're, if we're going to work in this industry
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.800]   and participate in life, just the way Dwight said, the way that we do, it's these five
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.440]   companies are kind of inevitable.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.040]   This is, this brings us to Huawei.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.600]   And man, I am still on the fence on this.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.280]   So Huawei, the Chinese company that manufactures, it's the number two or three, depending on
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.560]   the month smartphone manufacturer in the world, Samsung and then Huawei and Apple trade places.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:31.560]   It's the number one by far 5G equipment manufacturer in the world.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.960]   And the United States has basically said, you may not use Huawei gear.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.800]   It told, it started by telling the Defense Department, but late, but the latest story
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.840]   is that the White House plans to issue an executive order right in front of Mobile World
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.360]   Congress.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.680]   This is from Politico that will ban Chinese telecom equipment entirely.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.880]   Now, fortunately, there is somewhere you can go.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.000]   There's Erickson and Nokia.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.920]   They are making 5G gear.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.560]   But the president of Huawei, actually it wasn't the president.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:10.040]   It was the US president, I guess, of Huawei was very upset.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.440]   He says, we've denied this again and again.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.600]   There is no evidence of the Chinese government interfering with our business or using our
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.400]   equipment to spy on anybody.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.880]   This is a political decision.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.360]   And this is where I'm on the fence because I think it is a political decision.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.520]   And yet there's some merit.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.920]   There's some potential that if the Chinese government went to Huawei, whether Huawei's
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.920]   is working for the government or not now, if at some point the Chinese government said
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.840]   to Huawei, incidentally, we'd like to have access to all your switches everywhere in
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.320]   the world, they really couldn't say no.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.000]   So there is a threat.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.280]   There's no, I don't think there's any evidence that, well, there is a little bit.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.640]   There's a Huawei executive was arrested for spying in Poland and Huawei fired him immediately.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.240]   Huawei CFO is in jail in Canada about to be extradited for the United States, to the United
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.000]   States for fraud.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.880]   What do you guys think?
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   Go ahead, Gina.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.680]   We'll let you start.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.480]   That was mean.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   Go.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   That was mean.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.760]   This is a tough one, Leo.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.000]   Is it technical or is it political?
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.880]   And is it smart to do, is it prudent to do it, whether it's politics or not?
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.320]   Or technical and political different things.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.960]   I mean, technology is inherently political.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.640]   I'm going to start getting feminist here.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   That's good.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   I like it.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.640]   I like it.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.360]   Technology is political.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.200]   I mean, both.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   That's all I got.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   This is a tough one.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   This is a real tough one.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.560]   To a certain extent, I think it's not necessarily new.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:54.360]   I know that in the Obama administration, I think the people as far back as James Clapper
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.760]   were warning about Chinese hardware.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.600]   But as far back as the Obama era, they were not offering details.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.960]   It was national security and that was a curtain over any kind of detail they would
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   offer.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:21.800]   I think that if you're skeptical and if you don't take things at face value, you can
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.960]   look at this and say, yeah, it's political.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.720]   But if you're also technical, you also know it's possible.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.280]   That's why it's difficult, isn't it?
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   Right.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   And that's what makes it difficult.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.160]   I think in terms of it may be political, and it may also be economic because if you want
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:47.480]   to give US allies who make this gear in the 5G run up to give them an advantage over
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:54.440]   Huawei, you certainly could use your political muscle to block that and allow Erickson and
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.440]   the others.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:01.520]   He also Samsung also makes 5G gear and allow them essentially to get a head start in the
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.440]   United States and in Western countries.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.400]   So it may also be economic.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.160]   It's also interesting that I mean, I think looking at it through the lens of just the
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:17.720]   United States and Huawei is interesting, but Australia has banned them.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.560]   They're working with them still though.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.040]   Sure, but New Zealand as well has...
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.120]   Canada is going to spend a billion dollars to pull Huawei gear out.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.320]   So it's, you know, technology is political.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.160]   It's complicated.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.040]   And yet you hear this, but there are many Chinese companies, right?
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:41.760]   And much of our equipment, my iPhone's made in China.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.320]   So is this...
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.160]   Is Huawei being made an example?
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.360]   This is an editorial from a couple of weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.280]   The US can destroy Huawei.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.720]   It's a risky but powerful way to show Beijing stealing no longer works.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.600]   This is an opinion piece we should point out, but he says the really the big part, big
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:05.240]   point of the Huawei story is it's based on stealing ideas from the West, including a
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   Cisco router.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:12.400]   In fact, an early Huawei router design was shown to have been stolen from Cisco right
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.320]   down to the typos and the instruction manual.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.160]   They attempted to steal Tappy, the robot from T-Mobile.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.120]   Whoa, how dare you?
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.440]   It's a robot for testing phones, it taps on them.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.200]   So maybe this is a...
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.840]   I don't know.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.960]   I feel like if you're going to say, "Well, we can't use Chinese equipment because the
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.760]   Chinese company might be at some point beholden to the Chinese government," that's going to
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.800]   really become a problem.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.320]   That's something you can't do.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.320]   Well, remember the Bloomberg story about a fine thing.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:53.960]   Super Micro, the finding the chips in there has not been anybody who's been able to come
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.800]   behind to duplicate that story.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.840]   Everybody involved has denied it.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.400]   Bloomberg has not issued a retraction or a correction on it.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.800]   It's a very strange story.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.440]   But I think that...
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.640]   I use the word paranoid.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.280]   I think there's a level of paranoia there, whether it is justified or not, who knows,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.240]   but it thinks things are definitely weird.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.600]   Other point is that we are really all interdependent.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.760]   That's what technology does.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.080]   That's what the Kashmir Hills story shows us.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.920]   It's not limited to those five.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.400]   We're interdependent nation to nation.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.960]   It's kind of a...
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.240]   I think a tangle we can't undo.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.600]   You know what I think the answer is?
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   What is it?
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   It's blockchain.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.400]   The answer is not blockchain.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.400]   Thank God, blockchain is here.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:53.760]   I didn't mean to bring up something so intranced and intractable, but it's just an interesting
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   story.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.440]   I don't know what to think about it.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:02.120]   It's clear that as far as the US is concerned, they want to put Huawei out of business.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.800]   Don't you think at this point, if there was something in the code that would allow that,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.680]   or if there's something already there, that someone would have reverse engineered it and
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.480]   found it by now?
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   Let's hope and wish.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.760]   The problem is these routers, which are really...
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.360]   They're hardware and software combinations.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.600]   They have a lot of software.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.440]   The software is updated all the time.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.440]   So even if you...
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.360]   Actually, it's an interesting point.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:33.200]   In the old days when routers and switches were hardware only, that's exactly what happened.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.480]   You'd go through it, you'd make sure it did what it said it would do and nothing else.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.080]   You'd freeze it and it'd be done with.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.840]   But so much software is involved these days and that software is updated so frequently,
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.760]   I think impossible to do an audit.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.440]   Well, and you'll see a lot more stuff like Google has started to talk about how much
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.800]   it's doing software to find networking.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   So you can...
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   Exactly.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.440]   So if you take that to its logical extreme, then the hardware is sort of a thin substrate
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.560]   and the real power is in the software.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.440]   And then the software can always be changed.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   It's always malleable.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.360]   And so it's who holds the keys, who can update that software, who can sign and cryptographically
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.080]   vouch for that software.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:14.120]   And if a particular provider wanted to change the functionality, it's not clear how well
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.320]   people would even notice.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:20.120]   I'm quoting David Sanger, who was a security correspondent for The New York Times.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   He has a book called The Perfect Weapon, War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age that talks
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.120]   about this.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.200]   And I heard an interview with him on Fresh Air with Terry Grossen.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.520]   That's exactly what he said.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.360]   It's so much software that at this point, there'd be no way to validate it.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   On the bright side, we do get to live in a William Gibson future.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.360]   You know, like...
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.160]   It's a little more dystopian.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.000]   Science fiction is here.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   It is here.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.440]   Really, that's kind of the lately all the shows boil down to is dystopia, utopia.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.600]   Dystopia, utopia.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   Which is it?
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   Which is it?
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   A little bit of both.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.600]   Gina's right.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   A little bit of both.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   It's both.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   A little bit of both.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.200]   I mean, for me, just if you think about this too much, it will drive you absolutely crazy
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.680]   and paralyze you.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   I think that some paranoia is healthy and I think we have to be aware.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   But also sometimes I just have to be like, "Okay, we're going to move forward.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.440]   I'm going to trust that there are people looking through this code and checking it."
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.240]   But I also have to expect that huge bugs and vulnerabilities are going to show up, whether
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   that's through other governments or just bugs in the software and how do we respond to that?
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.960]   And you hope that things get better, that the checkpoints get better, right?
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.040]   But you're just kind of crossing your fingers and hoping.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:36.280]   Is there anything that an end user should do for prudency's sake that just to protect
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   yourself?
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.200]   I mean, is there any?
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.840]   I mean, what I came away with from Cashmerehills' article is just give up.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.520]   Well, for instance, get rid of Facebook would be a good start.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.200]   Get rid of maybe, I don't know, what else?
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.920]   Instagram, if you're going to get rid of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, that might
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.320]   be a start.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.040]   But then I often feel like, "Well, but then it doesn't matter because I'm carrying in
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.840]   my pocket a surveillance device with a microphone camera, GPS, that's always broadcasting back
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:14.400]   to bad actors like my cell phone company who will gladly sell it to the highest bidder."
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   Right.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   It feels pretty hopeless.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   You'd have to throw out a lot of tech.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.720]   You'd have to become the Unabomber and just kind of live in a cabin in the woods.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.160]   You don't have to send bombs.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.240]   But you'd have to live in a cabin in the woods to get away from all of this.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:32.880]   It's interesting to me thinking about the system level, how you would make things work
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   better.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   What if you had more journalists with a better view into technology?
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.880]   The Brian Krebs of the whole.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.880]   I love that.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.360]   We need a hundred Brian Krebs, I agree with you.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   Right.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.080]   Who can spot the problems and when they find that carriers are selling your location to
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.280]   bounty hunters, then that will cause pressure to stop.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.200]   He's been great with the blower.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.600]   We need more whistleblowers.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   That might be it.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   Definitely more whistleblowers.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.120]   But also, opting out of things like Facebook Leo, it doesn't matter, right?
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.000]   Because you shared, you were all connected and you shared your email address with other
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   people.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.440]   Facebook's building a profile of you.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   Right.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.040]   Whether or not you participate, you might as well control that story.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.920]   We've had, I mean, you can make sure your passwords are good and unique across your
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.920]   sites.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.400]   There's lots of things that you can do, right?
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   But there's also a lot of things that you can't prevent.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.680]   You just have to sort of know, like, okay, if I'm going to participate in this, if I'm
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:23.120]   going to have this device on my person all the time, then here's what that means.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.840]   Was McNeely right?
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   Privacy is dead.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840]   Get over it.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840]   Hmm.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:35.920]   He said that 20 years ago, but I think he's privacy is not dead, but it severely has
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   changed.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.920]   It has changed.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.720]   How I expected him in the thing.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   It's dead.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.000]   It's just resting.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.200]   Privacy has changed to the point that you have to be more vigilant over it than you used
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   to.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:59.120]   I think there are things that you could do and in your behaviors that you can take that
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.600]   can protect your privacy.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.800]   But I also think you have a whole generation who's growing up in this where they just assume
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.280]   that everything is out there.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:15.760]   And I think their expectation of privacy is very different than what ours is.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.840]   You know what it reminds me of?
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.080]   It's much lower.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.640]   Do you remember you always used to make fun of when Eric Schmidt would say particular
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.080]   things about going up to the creepy line or whatever?
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:31.200]   But he said, well, teenagers will have the point where they turn 18 and their social
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.440]   media just all gets erased and they change to a new day.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.600]   That's a good idea.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.040]   And Snapchat kind of is creating that a little bit.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.120]   Although Snapchat is now looking at making permanent data because there's a demand for
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   that too.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:50.600]   And after all, Facebook saw a threat from Snapchat so they stole many of Snapchat's most popular
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.840]   features and put it in Instagram and all the kids said, oh, look, shiny.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.000]   I think kids are aware of this.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   I think they're smart.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.160]   What are you going to tell your daughter?
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.680]   She's six now.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.000]   I'll tell her about how she shares.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.720]   Oh, we're going to have a lot of conversations about that once she has her own accounts and
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   that kind of thing.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.480]   That's only a few years off.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.920]   Yeah, that's only a few years off.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.120]   We're going to just talk about it a bunch.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:21.720]   I mean, I think it's just I want her to just be to know and to understand the possible implications
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   of what she's doing, the difference between permanence and what it means when she puts
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.360]   a picture of her friend or of other people too.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.760]   I don't share a whole lot of photos of her online, certainly not publicly, just because
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.600]   I want her to make that choice.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.760]   But yeah, just kind of instilling those best practices.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.440]   But again, she's going to have a phone.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.840]   She's going to be all for location and all for data is going to be out there as well.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.840]   I know that.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.200]   I can be a lot of--
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.880]   Lately, and I'm by the way, there's no one that lives more in public than me.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.440]   I mean, I have nothing to hide.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:57.080]   I give people my phone number, my address, everything.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.360]   But I am now starting to get a queasy feeling.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:05.000]   The other day we were in LA, we rode a jump bike, which is Uber's new electric bike rental.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Really cool.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.280]   Except that even as I'm using the phone to sign in and connecting it to my account, I'm
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:16.200]   thinking the back of my head, well, now Uber knows everywhere I'm going on this bike.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.400]   Maybe I'm showing up on the God.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.280]   Remember, they had that God app that would let you know wherever you were.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   God view.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   God view.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:27.440]   I'm just-- I'm getting-- it's a low-grade, queasy feeling whenever I use this stuff.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.960]   I don't know if that's a good thing.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.960]   Maybe we'll just--
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.240]   Just a question to tune it out.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.960]   So the question is, Leo, what does it matter that they know?
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.000]   What does it matter that Uber knows that while you're using their product?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   What does that matter?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   I agree with you.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And that's the question I always raise.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.240]   You've heard me say this many times.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.640]   Well, so what?
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.760]   And I know so what, but I'm still getting that queasy feeling because there's this psychological
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:59.000]   thing of, well, but people can spy on me or follow me around or know where I am or--
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.040]   I worry that this is not good for our mental state in the long run.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.960]   It sure wouldn't be good to be a paranoid in this stage.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.960]   No.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.960]   You have lots of evidence.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   That's true.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:18.560]   So what's interesting is you talked about your serial daughter, Gina, and eventually
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.040]   she'll have a phone.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:27.040]   When my kids were that age and I was reviewing computers for the Houston Chronicle, I kept
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.320]   all the computers in one room and I let the kids use the review machines because it was
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.480]   interesting and instructional watching them use it.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.440]   But our computers were all in one room.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.480]   I could see what they were doing all the time.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.040]   They didn't have computers up in their rooms.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.640]   And that was really useful because I could say, oh, well, let me tell you what you're
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   doing.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.000]   Let me let's talk about that.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.360]   You can't do that anymore with a smart phone.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.360]   No, no, they had their computer.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.360]   No, you cannot--
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.440]   You cannot limit it at all.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.680]   And so that's a real challenge for parents.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.920]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:01.800]   I mean, also, I'm setting this expectation with my daughter, too, that knowing this information
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.520]   is kind of normal.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.080]   So I commute home from Manhattan to Brooklyn on the train or the bus.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.920]   And so when I leave the office, I send a city mapper.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.400]   I send a city mapper link to my partner, who then brings up a map, a live map, where
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.040]   she and my daughter can see how close I am to home and what time I'm going to get there.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.040]   So literally as I'm walking up to my door, my daughter, it's great.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.600]   She runs down the hallway to give me a hug because she knows she can see the little green
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   guy and city mapper where I am.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.080]   So I mean, to her, she's six years old.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.840]   Like the idea that she can see exactly where I am on my commute, that's completely and
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   totally normal and it would be terrible if they couldn't track my location.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.640]   Because you know what time I'd be home for dinner, you know?
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:44.600]   And that's, by the way, why you're going to give her a phone the minute you can.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.520]   Because then if she can see what she is.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.400]   But not only that, if she needs help, she can call.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.800]   If she's stranded, she can call.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.640]   It's true.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.680]   And she's got a phone number on her arm when we go to really crowded places.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.400]   Oh, this is more.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.120]   The county fair or whatever and say, okay, if you get lost, you go find somebody with
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.120]   a phone and have them call.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   She's going to have her own phone for that reason.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.280]   So it's going to be really interesting.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.200]   I think she's going to have very different ideas and expectations and worries.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.440]   I just don't think she's going to be that paranoid about sharing that information.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.600]   No, she probably isn't.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.480]   It's just the world the way it is.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:22.440]   But it's interesting that Apple's decided to make privacy like a competitive advantage
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.840]   and to talk about that.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.200]   And I think that sets the trend where more so in the future, people will be making these
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.960]   judgments about the companies that they choose to do business with based on maybe they won't
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.800]   read the full end user license agreement.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.920]   But they will say, hmm, I'm not sure that I trust this company as much as that company.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.760]   And it's still possible to take one out of the big five and cut one out.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.400]   Like if you choose, you're going to deactivate your Facebook account or something like that.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.360]   You can still do that at this point.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.680]   It's not too late in other words.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.680]   Right.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.080]   It's a compete if people get to compete on privacy.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.040]   I think that will help quite a bit.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.600]   Although Apple's the only one at this point who can reasonably say, I think others might.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:09.680]   Google has done a little bit, not as much as Apple where they can say, okay, these are
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.400]   the only times that we're going to hand information over to the police or we're going to allow
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.680]   you to know if legally something's been removed from the search result.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.200]   Google's interesting because maybe they're maybe they're not so different than Apple.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.400]   I'm sure Apple's collecting all this data.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.960]   They just don't do anything with it.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   Maybe I don't know.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.600]   But Google, Google decided, well, we're going to collect data.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.520]   So let's be transparent about it.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.480]   And I do believe that they're very transparent about what data they collect.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.000]   You can go to the dashboard.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.960]   They're not hiding anything.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.240]   And I think it's their hope that, well, if we don't hide it, people will feel more
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.560]   comfortable sharing it.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.160]   I don't know if that's true though.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.680]   Do you know how many people know about the dashboard?
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.400]   It's a tiny percentage of people who know about that.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.000]   And when they see it, they're freaked out.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   They see it.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   They're freaked out.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   I mean, I knew about it.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.600]   And whenever I go look at it, which is not that often, I'm always like, oh, right.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.120]   Yeah, they have all this.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.920]   It's interesting that Apple is positioning itself as the company that respects your privacy.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.000]   And I mean, I've definitely heard debates about paying for that.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.080]   Like you pay for premium for Apple hardware and you're also paying for privacy, right?
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.800]   So Facebook's free and part of what you pay, Facebook is with your data.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.720]   And I think people feel that way about Google as well.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.440]   Although it is interesting that I think that some of Apple's products suffer because it
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.680]   doesn't collect and use data as well as Google does.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.240]   Like Apple Maps is terrible, right?
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:39.320]   Do you think that Apple Maps would be better if it was the same kind of approach as Google
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.320]   maybe?
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.960]   Well, let's take a break.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:48.120]   When we come back, we're going to talk about how some countries are trying to stop this.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:56.040]   German regulators, this is a great link, baby headline from Wired Emily Dreyfus.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.800]   German regulators just outlawed Facebook's whole business model.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.480]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.440]   Let's talk about it.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.320]   Our show today brought to you by a brand.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.800]   Hey, I want to welcome a brand new advertiser to the show smart deploy.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:18.840]   If you're an IT, you know all about this notion of, hey, I got 100 machines to set up.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.520]   I'm going to create a golden image and blast it to all the machines.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.840]   But there's problems.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.520]   Those machines all have to be identical, right?
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:32.760]   Smart deploy allows IT departments to reimage unlimited computer models from one golden image.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:39.320]   It's a one click user data migration for simplified migrations, zero touch network deployment
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.840]   imaging over the internet application deployment to make your product project stress free.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:51.560]   But the cool thing is these platform packs and they include 1200 different platforms,
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:59.240]   Lenovo, HP, Dell, all the major OEMs, inject drivers into the image so that it will work
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   on that machine.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.520]   You make one image when you need to support a new model, you download the pack, you deploy
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.800]   your golden image and boom, you're set up.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.400]   And as I mentioned, it's not just for entire operating systems.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:16.160]   You could have all the line of business apps that you use and have it in an image that's
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.120]   just deployed over the internet, deployed over the network.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.360]   And I mean it when I say deployed over the internet, you can use Dropbox or a cloud service
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.760]   and deploy it there.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.200]   Smart deploy is the most reliable, easy to use solution over 2.2 million endpoints now.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   This is awesome.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.680]   It's the only solution, the first solution to offer imaging over Wi-Fi, which means you
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.320]   can manage remote users and satellite offices even if you're not on the same network.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.920]   You could deploy images, apps, updated drivers.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:52.880]   Yeah, you could update drivers too via Google Drive, Dropbox OneDrive, OneDrive for business.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.080]   It's very easy to use.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.880]   You don't have to be an IT guru to use it.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.280]   They've got step by step wizards.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:02.840]   It'll guide you through the process and complicated steps like sys prep or handle for you automatically.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.160]   No ramp up, no training necessary.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:10.200]   You can migrate 100 computers to Windows 10 in under an hour because it's got multicast.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.960]   Isn't this great?
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:16.400]   Seattle based support team made up of imaging and Windows experts.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.760]   They're just an email or phone call away.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.400]   Widely use Nissan uses it.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.720]   UCLA and Nintendo smart deploy.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.400]   Make that dreaded task of computer imaging a little less painful.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:36.200]   By the way, they're giving away 15 free licenses, including a year of support at smart deploy.com/twit.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.520]   This is a great way to try it out.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.080]   That's $720 worth of free IT software.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.920]   If you work at a company with 50,000 to 50,000 computers and go to smart deploy.com/twit,
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.560]   you'll get those 15 free licenses with one year of support and be able to try it out.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.920]   I think you're going to love it.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.840]   Some regulators just outlawed Facebook's whole ad business.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:05.480]   This comes from the German Federal Cartel Office on Thursday.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.040]   The company's antitrust regulator.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.120]   This is an antitrust thing.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:15.580]   Ruled that Facebook was exploiting consumers by making them agree to data collection in
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.960]   order to have an account.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.520]   Facebook has one month to appeal and one month they will have to stop Facebook.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.280]   This is a quote from Andreas Munt, the president of the SCO.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.320]   "Facebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.240]   collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts."
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.560]   This comes, I think, as Facebook's considering, apparently, merging WhatsApp, Instagram,
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:49.120]   and Facebook user data across all three, which means billions of people.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.280]   It's not clear what Facebook wants to do about this.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.640]   We disagree, they write in a blog post with their conclusions and intend to appeal.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.920]   I think this is the line that has the threat so that people in Germany continue to benefit
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.040]   fully from all our services.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:18.240]   It would be a shame if you were no longer able to use Facebook in Germany.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.880]   This is an interesting approach.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.960]   When we have these conversations as we did in the last section about privacy, there's
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.640]   always, it always comes up, well, maybe we should just regulate it.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.840]   But honestly, this is how Facebook works.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.360]   Facebook has 32 million monthly active users in Germany.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.920]   That's 80% market share.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.800]   The regulator says that makes them trust and that gives us the jurisdiction to oversee
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.000]   their data collection practices.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.040]   As a dominant company, Facebook is subject to special obligations under competition law.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.920]   Should this happen in the US?
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.880]   Nobody wants to weigh in on this one.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.240]   Matt's Mike has cut.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:10.760]   I think we said before that when, because I think it was on one of the episodes where
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.840]   we were talking about what was happening with the GDPR.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:22.920]   And that essentially the irony is that it will be Europe that has more impact on the
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.520]   way American companies behave in America than the US government will.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.920]   And I think you're starting to see that.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.960]   I think that obviously if Facebook makes changes like this, has to make changes like
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:39.120]   this in Germany, it has to look at doing it across its entire platform.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.480]   One of the things that is interesting about this is it's the antitrust regulators that
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.720]   are doing this.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:50.800]   In the cartel company, the cartel agency, I love that.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:57.040]   In the past, data and privacy really weren't part of that consideration, trust consideration.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:05.720]   But essentially, the German regulator is saying, look, you're so dominant in Germany
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.600]   that people are almost required to use you and you're using your dominant position to
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.320]   invade their privacy in ways we don't think is okay.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:18.900]   This is the first instance where regulators are saying that because a company has such
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.160]   market power, consent is not freely given.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.160]   That's the point.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:30.800]   And, you know, similar arguments, I'm sure will appear against Google as well.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:38.920]   74% of American Facebook users surveyed by Pew last month did not know that Facebook
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.760]   maintained profiles about their interest.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.680]   This is what you were talking about, Gina.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.280]   The dashboard, right?
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:49.800]   51% said once they were shown what Facebook was collecting, I'm not comfortable with that.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.600]   So people don't know about it in the US and the regulator saying even less so in Germany
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.480]   and they don't have a choice.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:03.720]   And when they say non-Facebook data, they mean data in other Facebook apps like Instagram
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:08.760]   and WhatsApp, but they're also talking about like you go to a website that has the Facebook
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.320]   bug installed on it, but you don't know that, but Facebook knows that you visited that site.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:19.160]   I think that is something that like a normal consumer is unaware of.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:25.320]   This was what Congress member, Congress asks Mark Zuckerberg about what do they call these
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:32.840]   ghost dossiers, the shadow accounts as you're followed around the internet.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.440]   And Zuckerberg said, "We don't do that."
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.760]   I'm hoping nobody would follow up.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.520]   What are you talking about?
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.600]   Of course they do.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   We know they do that.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.800]   In fact, if you download your Facebook data, I would imagine you'll see some of that.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:54.240]   Well, and it's interesting that there wasn't as much ability to do follow up in that hearing
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:59.600]   because you need more technological expertise and they were only giving fun.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   And they were only giving fun.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.600]   Right.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:07.960]   People to ask good questions and have people who understand how computers work is part
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.240]   of the process, I think.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.880]   That's a long and sad story about the, what was it called?
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:21.040]   We had this great group of people that were advisors, technology advisors to Congress.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.040]   Right.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.040]   That got shut down.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.400]   You can shut down some years ago.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.400]   Yeah, '94.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.400]   In the '90s.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:32.200]   Although I imagine congressional staffers are sophisticated these days, fairly sophisticated.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   They're not good.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   Absolutely.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.200]   They're smart.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   So the staffers probably knew.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.360]   But the whole thing was set up in that case not to have follow up questions.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.360]   There are organizations.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:44.480]   So there's one called Tech Congress, for example, that tries to get technologists and bring
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.640]   them into Congress to advise people so they can ask better questions and understand technology
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.680]   and its impacts more.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.440]   So it's nice to see those green sprouts happening at least.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:51:00.240]   So I know you will, Gina, know we'll be able to imagine Jeff's reaction to this German
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   regulation.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.800]   I really miss Jeff's reaction to the Germans and John Holmes.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.880]   He's going to turn bright red.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:12.520]   I can't wait till Wednesday.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.760]   It's an interesting problem.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:19.560]   In fact, there's a great article in a medium by Ben Longstaff.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.360]   What happens when Google says we're not going to pay the fines?
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:33.520]   50 million euro fine against Google and GDPR a couple of weeks ago, the French competition
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:40.200]   agency imposed a fine on Google saying they were not trans-- similar problem, right?
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.160]   They weren't transparent and gathering information.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:48.240]   They didn't give people a clear enough opt-outs on privacy.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:54.400]   So Ben says, "Okay, well Google could easily pay that, but what if that fine were actually
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.600]   the full GDPR fine, which is 4% of global revenue?
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.320]   That would be $4.4 billion for Google.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:11.400]   At what point does Google say, "Oh no, we're not going to pay you.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.400]   And what would France do?
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:17.960]   Would France then imagine if the French government says, "Well, all right, Google can't operate
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.160]   in France."
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.440]   What would be the reaction of French citizens?
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:30.200]   Here he imagines a banner on Google pages that people who come to Google.FR would see.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.160]   Your government has breached our terms of service until you replace them where unable
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.760]   to provide your country with service.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   Yikes.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.680]   Why, your Gmail?
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.680]   Sorry.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:43.040]   Need files from your Google Drive?
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.040]   Nope.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   This is my favorite.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.960]   Lost in the need of directions from Google Maps.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.760]   I hear you can use the sun for that.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.400]   That's such a good lie.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.400]   I hear.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.680]   I mean, Google has a pretty strong response.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.480]   Maybe they would be reluctant to use that because of course it would look pretty bad
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   to do so.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:10.140]   Well, and at first glance this seems completely unrealistic, but there was at least Google
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.000]   News in I think it was Spain.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   They did this in Spain?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.240]   Where they were like, "We can't operate in the country anymore because of the law you
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.920]   just passed and so we're done."
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:26.760]   The impact that it had on a lot of small news websites, it tended to push the traffic
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:30.840]   back toward the established publishers.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.880]   It's interesting to see how you could write a short story about what would happen if you
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.800]   got something in the end user license agreement that said, "By the way, if you don't pay your
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.960]   licenses, then the company will take over your judiciary or something like that."
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:48.040]   And this brings us right back those full circle to the conversation at the beginning
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.040]   of the show.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.240]   I mean, we're really dependent on these companies.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:58.160]   If they said, "No, no Google Maps for you," that would be problematic to say the least.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.360]   My car has Google Maps, right?
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.400]   I wouldn't know how to drive.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.560]   I forgot how to do that.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:11.720]   Well, I don't think that Google would even consider that.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.880]   I think they understand their citizens of the world.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.840]   They don't want the black mark and so forth.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   But you're right.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:23.640]   I guess the question was, "Okay, they're not 50 million euros big deal.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.640]   That's pocket change."
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.840]   But what if they did eventually say, "We want $4.5 billion?
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.240]   What would Google do?"
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.480]   Wow.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:40.320]   Here's an example of corporate blackmail, actually.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.840]   And I'm not talking the examiner here.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.840]   The...
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.840]   I mean, the choir.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   By the way, the choir.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   I did not want...
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.120]   I'm going to just say this right now.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.960]   In case you're tuned in to find out what our esteemed panel thinks about Jeff Bezos and
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:57.360]   the National Choir, I decided this is not a tech story.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.360]   This is a gossip story.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.360]   This is a politics story.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.280]   But I don't think there's a tech angle.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.440]   So I've just decided not to put that on a red downer.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   Okay?
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.440]   Everybody's talking about it.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.440]   I know.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.440]   Well, actually...
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.440]   I'm going to start sending you some hearts.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.440]   Yes.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.440]   Thank you.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.480]   She's sending hearts on Skype.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   That turns her blue.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.560]   We don't know why.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:25.720]   The tech question is, how did they get the texts and the pictures?
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.800]   I think that's even still.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.240]   That's the tech question.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.480]   That's the tech question.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.640]   I'll let you talk about that in tech burger.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.520]   Save that for tech burger.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.560]   However, Amazon is not above blackmail of its own.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.560]   Read this one.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.320]   This is in the Washington Post.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.600]   The story was leaked to the Washington Post.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:52.480]   Facing opposition, Amazon reconsiders New York headquarters site to officials say, "Okay,
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.600]   I'm going to bet those two officials are Amazon officials who perhaps might have just
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.960]   called the Washington Post and say, "You know what?
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.360]   If they don't, if they don't wise up there in New York City, we could just pull out."
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   Remember...
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.840]   Amazon's not tough enough for the big apple.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.800]   They're not tough enough.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.800]   God.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   Throw a little bit of a thick skin.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.360]   Give me a break.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:17.080]   You want to hug you and kiss you when you arrive?
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.720]   They have no idea.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.080]   This is a Brooklyn hug.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.520]   What are you talking about?
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.440]   What you talking about?
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.280]   So the issue is that a lot of...
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.940]   There has been some criticism from advocacy groups and elected officials because Amazon
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.640]   will, no matter where it goes, get big tax breaks.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.840]   But it will also bring 25,000 jobs to the new campus, which is on Long Island, right?
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:38.840]   It's Queens, right?
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:39.840]   Long Island City, yes.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.840]   Long Island City, yes.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:47.600]   But maybe some people in Long Island City aren't too happy about just the big Amazon
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   moving in.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.600]   Remember what happened?
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.600]   The housing prices in Seattle.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.600]   Yes.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.560]   You know, there's that issue of tax breaks.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:58.720]   I think the governor and the mayor think it's a good thing because they're going to
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.420]   generate jobs so they'll get the money back.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.860]   Nevertheless, Amazon...
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.140]   And again, maybe they're not really considering pulling out.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.460]   But remember, they did a big hunt.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.460]   They went big deal.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:14.060]   They went to a lot of cities that said, "What would you give us if we relocated?"
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.420]   The idea that abandoned...
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.420]   Okay, fine.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.220]   You don't want us?
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.940]   See ya.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.300]   That's blackmail.
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.060]   That's blackmail.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:27.260]   Where is it just responding to incentives?
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:32.820]   I'm going to say if Amazon decides to put more technology people in DC as a result, I'm
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.340]   not going to object to that.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.420]   Yeah, by the way, that was one of the places it could have been.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:41.020]   In fact, isn't it for Northern Virginia, there's going to be a satellite there?
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.420]   Right, there's two of them.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.420]   Two HQ twos.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.620]   I thought that was funny.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.900]   Especially this week.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:52.140]   For obvious reasons.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.340]   Which we won't go into.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:58.340]   Let's see, Amazon started a QVC.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:59.340]   Did you say, "Have you...
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.580]   Anybody watched Amazon Live?"
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.020]   Livestreamed Video.
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.020]   It's very much like QVC.
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:12.380]   It features livestreamed video shows from Amazon highlighting current deals at Amazon.com.
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.020]   Also brands can broadcast their own live streams.
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:16.020]   Amazon bought Twitch.
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.660]   I wonder if this is the Twitch back end.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:23.060]   There's a new app called Amazon Live Creator.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.060]   This is the future of home shopping, right?
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.860]   This is user-generated content, so users are doing this?
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:29.860]   It can be both.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:30.860]   It can be both.
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:31.860]   It can be both.
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:36.420]   So let's see, right now, right now on Amazon Live, TrueGrid Permeable Pavers.
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.420]   Really a great deal.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.420]   What?
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:42.340]   Oh no, this is an old one.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.580]   So this is user-generated.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.780]   Here's the guy from TrueGrid.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.100]   Should I turn the sound on?
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.100]   You want to...
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.100]   Strongest Permeable Pavers.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.100]   It drains.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.540]   It's 100% pervious, so the water goes right through.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:54.540]   You can store water in the base.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.540]   We're here today.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:59:00.060]   Yeah, this is basically Twitch for infomercials, right?
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.420]   Wow, okay.
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.260]   I didn't even know I needed this.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.260]   You do.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:10.780]   If you've got a driveway, you need TrueGrid Permeable Pavers.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.780]   Here's some other things.
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.260]   Foot nanny peppermint yummy.
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.260]   I don't want to know what that is.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.100]   I'm going to be work-saving.
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.460]   I'm not clicking on it.
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:22.220]   How about the Pono board?
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.380]   Some sort of weird exercise.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:30.540]   So apparently, even though Amazon has its own stuff, there's quite a bit of third party.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.140]   Parenting game changer, Gina.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.380]   The cinema mood portable theater.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:40.540]   I'm Emily and thank you so much for joining us today live on Amazon.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.700]   We're super excited to have you.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.220]   So this is kind of interesting, right?
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.780]   I mean, this is obviously a small company.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:50.020]   Maybe even she's doing this in her second bedroom.
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:54.060]   And Amazon's giving her a chance to promote it.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:58.660]   It looks like a lot of these are the companies themselves promoting their own products.
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.980]   But I'm interested in like, could you imagine someone launch a new indie wire cutter but
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.620]   do it all in video?
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.260]   This is the official Amazon video.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.740]   That's a good idea.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.020]   Maybe Twitch should do that.
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.700]   We could do it on this platform.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.500]   Yeah, maybe you do.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.500]   Don't buy the whatever that was.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.500]   Put many peppermint yummies.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.340]   They're addictive.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.820]   I presume you get affiliate fees.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.820]   Affiliate.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:28.820]   All stuff, right?
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.820]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:30.820]   That would be.
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.820]   Right.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:39.300]   What's interesting is how in one on many platforms, Amazon approaches traditional retailing.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:44.540]   So if you think of QVC as being traditional cable retailing, here they are.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.420]   They're going into brick and mortar stores.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   There they are.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:53.420]   If they get bigger, they kind of move away from the internet and go more into traditional
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.340]   retailing, which people are used to seeing.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.740]   In this case, they've added the twist of being able to do your own.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:06.060]   And I assume some of those hosts act like almost like VJs where they will, if they find
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.740]   something they like, they'll pull it up and promote it.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.740]   And that's what you want to do.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.740]   You want to get featured?
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.140]   Where's the posture pup?
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.380]   I want to do that.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.340]   Number one, the internet is weird.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.340]   And is that on here?
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.340]   The posture pup live.
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.340]   Okay.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.340]   Oh, that's coming up later today.
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.540]   So I just have to say, you know how there's all those infomercials on YouTube where people
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.980]   are like starting to take a drink of a cup and then whoa, and it all falls over.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.980]   Like this is going to be more of that.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:31.980]   This is going to be even better.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.980]   Here's the posture pump potential.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.980]   It's fine in the middle.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.260]   You also receive a P on the wire.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.260]   I want to see the guy.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.620]   He's wearing the posture pump.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.620]   He's pumping up the water.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.620]   He's pumping up his posture pump.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.620]   I don't know.
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.860]   I think I'm getting one of those for Dwight.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.700]   You need that, Dwight.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:55.300]   I think this would be really, I like what you think, and Gina.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.380]   I wonder if they would allow us to put our reviews there.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.980]   When you're done completely?
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.980]   I mean, release the velcro structure.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:03.980]   That's something.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.580]   The posture pump.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.580]   Could I give a bad review to stuff?
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.580]   Sure.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.580]   Why not?
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:10.580]   That's how you build your credibility.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.580]   That's they don't say you can't.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.580]   Wow.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:20.580]   I don't know what to do about this.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.580]   You mean the posture pump or just the whole thing in general?
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.420]   Well, you know, you can have a second career.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.580]   You come home and you become a VJ selling posture pumps.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:35.980]   Well, ever since Gimlet got sold to Spotify for $230 million, I have been looking for
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:40.300]   the big score for Twit.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.900]   It might be the posture pump.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.900]   I'm just saying.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:45.900]   Wow.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.180]   Actually, we'll talk about that in just a bit and what it might mean for podcasting.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.420]   We've got a great panel.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:57.660]   Gina Tapanet, it's great to have you back on the show managing partner postlight.com.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.500]   And long, long time host on Twig founder of LifeHacker.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.460]   You still write it all for the web?
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.900]   You know, I write for postlight.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:10.940]   It has a publication and a podcast actually called Track Changes that I write on occasionally
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.180]   at postlight.com.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.500]   But not as much as I used to.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.180]   I really burned out on blogging every single day because I did it for five years there
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.180]   at LifeHacker.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.180]   Yeah, it's a lot.
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.180]   It's a lot.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.980]   But once in a while I get, I wrote a piece about personal finance apps actually recently.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.980]   Yes, it was good.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.980]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.100]   We have some of the chatroom who still uses to do.text.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.100]   Wow.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.500]   Are you keeping that up?
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.340]   I have not.
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.820]   I have seeded it to the community.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:38.820]   It is open source.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.820]   Nice.
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.980]   I had a few community members who are really into the idea of maintaining it.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:46.620]   And so, yeah, it's an org on GitHub and I transferred it over and I'm grateful that
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:49.380]   others are keeping it up.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:53.580]   Do I, Silverman, does the Chronicles tech burger have a podcast?
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.540]   No, but we're growing a number of podcasts.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:02.740]   I'm in our podcast studio surrounded by microphones and soundproofing.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.580]   And so we don't have one yet for tech.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.580]   I got a suggestion.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:11.620]   And if you wanted to do a tech or podcast, you could name it between the buns.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.380]   I'm just saying.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.780]   I would listen.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.860]   That, I think that's sold.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.580]   I'm giving it to you.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:20.580]   All right.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.580]   Thank you.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.580]   Thank you.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:26.100]   Houston Chronicle dot com slash tech burger.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.300]   And where can we find the podcast?
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.860]   Are they just all over?
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.460]   There, there, if you, I think you go to Houston Chronicle dot com slash podcast.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:39.460]   We have, we, the most interesting one that we started is one of our reporters who covers
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.820]   criminal justice.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.020]   Her name is Kerry Blakeinger.
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:49.380]   She actually did time in prison on a drug charge and she writes from some serious authenticity.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.780]   And she's doing a podcast about being in prison.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.780]   And it's, it's, it's really interesting and worthless.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:04.340]   Wow. And from the United States digital service administrator, Matthew cuts.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.580]   Do you get a title like general cuts?
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.060]   You should.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:16.060]   So whenever I was at the US digital service at the Pentagon, I had the level of 06, which
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.380]   is roughly equivalent to a colonel.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.380]   Colonel cuts.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.420]   So at some point you were, you were joking on twig about Colonel cuts and I was like,
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.700]   I was jogging, listening to it.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:24.700]   I am.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.700]   I am.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.700]   I am.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:31.980]   I was Colonel cuts in the dining room with the lead pipe.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:32.980]   With the candlestick.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.340]   Yeah, the candlestick.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.340]   Colonel cuts.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.340]   I like it.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.340]   You know, Colonel cuts is.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.940]   Well, you know, if you become the surgeon general, you get to be called general attorney
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:43.460]   general, get to be called general postmaster, get to be called general.
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.180]   I think you deserve at least a colonel.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.860]   I am very happy to be an administrator.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:52.460]   You know, in D.C. if you're a secretary, that is, you know, it sounds like something
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.540]   out of catch 22 major cuts.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:55.540]   It does.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.540]   All right.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.340]   I showed they brought to you by anyway, great to have all three of you.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:03.140]   We love it when you come back on the show and it's like old home week.
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.140]   It really feels good.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:05.980]   I showed they brought to you by fresh books.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:10.140]   If you're a freelancer, you know that making invoices is the worst part of the job, unless
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.220]   that's your business, like we're in the invoice business.
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.860]   But most of us, like for me, when I was going up to Canada to do the TV show at Rogers,
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:20.500]   at the end of the month, I'd have to put all my expenses together, send them an expense
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.580]   report and invoice them for the amount of money plus my time.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:28.140]   And I would just put it off, which turns out that when you don't invoice, you don't get
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.140]   paid and it got to 1.06 months behind.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.060]   I finally gave them the invoice for six months.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.020]   They said, never do that again or you will not get paid.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.500]   You will not get paid.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.780]   That's what Amber MacArthur told me about fresh books, a brand new startup in Toronto.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:45.580]   And now here we are, what, 15 years later, fresh books is just the king of the hill, the
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:49.980]   all in one accounting solution, helping small business owners thrive.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.980]   I said the bad word accounting.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.860]   But honestly, it is.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.300]   It's full industry standard accounting, but you don't have to be an accountant.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:02.860]   All you have to do is use fresh books to create your invoices, keep track of your expenses,
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.340]   and bingo right there on the fresh books page.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:10.660]   You'll immediately know because you're keeping track of expenses and income, you'll know
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.300]   whether you're making a profit.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:17.260]   You could easily generate accounting reports like general ledger, yeah, and balance sheet
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:22.940]   in the dashboard when tax time comes, you give your account and all the stuff they want.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:25.740]   And of course, you'll send professional looking invoices in seconds.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.020]   You can always see which invoices have been sent, which have been paid, which are overdue,
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.300]   and even which have been viewed.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.820]   So no more, I think get your invoice.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.820]   They got it.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.620]   They saw it.
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:42.020]   What's nice is it turns out your clients are not slow to pay because they don't want to
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.020]   pay you.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.100]   Most of the time they're slow to pay you for the same reason you're slow to invoice.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:48.620]   It's just a pain to get together all the bills at the end of the month of pay them.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.860]   It's so easy with fresh books because just because there's a fresh books, your fresh
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:55.100]   books customer, you get automatic online payments.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.860]   So they could just press a button on your invoices.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.380]   Go ahead, pay Leo.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:03.020]   That means you get paid on average twice as fast.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.980]   They're always adding new features too.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.980]   It's a web application.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:11.340]   So you're always getting new things like the proposals with rich text content and images.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:16.420]   You can now get e-signatures from your client that are legally binding.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.460]   It's easy to update expenses.
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:21.860]   Of course, the FreshBooks app takes pictures of the receipts and puts them right in the
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.860]   invoice.
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:29.020]   But you can even have FreshBooks log into your bank daily and download all your expenses.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.740]   FreshBooks works with everything you use already.
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:35.260]   Accuities, scheduling, pie, sync, mail, chimp and more.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.580]   Keep tabs in your business anytime, anywhere with the FreshBooks mobile app.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:40.180]   You are going to love FreshBooks.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.740]   You're going to have a great support team right out of Canada.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:47.140]   So they're nice 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern in a video hub where you can learn how to use
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.980]   it and get more information 24/7.
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.620]   Avoid the tax time scramble next year.
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:55.660]   It's too late for this year, but now is the time to get started with FreshBooks.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:00.300]   Upgrade to FreshBooks for effortless invoicing and just kind of in the process of life itself,
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.820]   all the accounting you need.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.900]   Try it free for 30 days at freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:11.620]   And if you do me a favorite, put this week in tech in that form that says, "How did you
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.620]   hear about us?"
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.620]   We'd appreciate it.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.620]   freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:18.780]   I've known these guys for years and I think the world of them.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:24.500]   freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:29.340]   So yeah, it was a bit of a shock to the podcasting community when it was announced this week
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:34.620]   that Spotify was going to buy two big podcasting entities, one gimlet, which is a producer
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:40.500]   podcast for a whopping $230 million.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:46.340]   Gimlet had raised about $40 million on maybe even a little less in the venture markets.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:51.580]   So this is a big payback for their investors and for the Gimlet founders and also a tool
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:52.580]   maybe less known.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:57.620]   But what I've used and I really like called Anchor, which is basically a podcast platform.
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:58.820]   It's like WordPress for podcasts.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:02.500]   Makes it very easy to use your smartphone to make really good sounding podcasts.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.700]   I've made quite a few using it.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.100]   I think it's a great way to do that.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.100]   It's interesting.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:12.660]   In fact, Ben Thompson has a very good article on Stratecary about the strategy behind this.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:15.140]   And I think I completely agree with him.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:21.380]   The problem that Spotify faced is the same problem Netflix faced a few years ago in the
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.620]   movie industry said, "Well, you guys are too successful.
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.740]   We're not going to let you have first run movies."
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.700]   Netflix response was, "Well, fine.
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.220]   We'll make our own and it's gone very well for them."
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.380]   Spotify is a similar problem.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.620]   Their profits are totally dependent on the music industry.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:43.500]   At any point, the music industry could put them out of business by charging more on royalties.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.380]   So they need their own content as well.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.620]   And what better content, audio content and podcasts?
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.620]   So it makes sense.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.100]   In fact, a lot of podcasters were on Spotify.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.260]   In fact, when Spotify announced that they were going to do podcasts, we were up there
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:11:01.100]   on stage with Daniel Ecken, one of the first, but their discovery platform is not super
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.100]   strong.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.020]   It's hard to figure out what's on there.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.780]   I think there's a lot more they can do.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.740]   Ben's article actually opened my eyes to one thing that I didn't realize, which is that
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.580]   Spotify is a big advertising company.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:19.900]   In fact, they have more advertising revenue than the entire podcast industry put together.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:27.020]   So there is definitely an opportunity here for, they drove $616 million in advertising
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.620]   revenue last year.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:33.540]   So there's definitely an opportunity for Spotify to maybe become an advertising platform for
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.580]   podcasters looking to monetize.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.300]   That would kind of make sense.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.100]   A couple of big questions though.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.540]   A, does Spotify want exclusivity?
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:45.420]   Because I would think they would because their revenue streams are twofold.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:49.580]   One is, of course, advertising, but the other more important revenue stream for Spotify
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:54.740]   is subscribers and exclusives drive subscriptions.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:58.620]   They don't get exclusives on music, but they certainly do have exclusives now.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.100]   In fact, on some Gimlet podcasts, if you want to listen to "Crimetown," you can't listen
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.220]   to it on the open web.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.580]   You can't listen to it on your Amazon Echo.
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:11.740]   You have to listen to it on Spotify.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:14.300]   So I'm a little concerned about that as a podcaster.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:21.420]   I hate to see podcasts become hide behind paywalls.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.420]   What do you think?
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.500]   Certainly a seed change.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:30.580]   Maybe this is too inside baseball because after all, as a podcast, we care about this
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.100]   probably more than the average world.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.580]   What do you think, man?
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.460]   Oh, I see Dwight.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.300]   Dwight, are you trying to speak?
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.300]   How muted?
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:41.300]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.300]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.300]   No, I was muted.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.300]   Did you go that?
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:49.540]   I was just going to say that people who listen to this podcast listen to other podcasts and
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.300]   are interested in the medium, I think.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.300]   Okay.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.700]   So I'm not sure it's necessarily inside.
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.540]   I mean, I certainly care a lot about it.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.340]   I enjoy reply all.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.340]   It's a great podcast.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.340]   That's a Gimlet podcast.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.340]   It's a very well done talk podcast.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.340]   So I visited Gimlet.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:08.140]   Like, on one hand, it's interesting that there are they a technology company or are they
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.700]   a media company?
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:13.580]   And you know, with the big companies like the Facebooks and the Google's of the world,
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.060]   they always claim to be technology companies.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.780]   So it's interesting to say where did Gimlet fit in that?
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.140]   Yeah, it's a media company.
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.140]   It's pretty sure.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.860]   It's like buying HBO or something like that.
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.860]   You're buying.
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:31.700]   And I think this is what Spotify was interested in a company that could create new podcasts.
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:37.620]   I would say exclusive, although Spotify denies us for the Spotify platform.
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:41.300]   And then with Anchor, they can attract other podcasters.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:47.700]   They could say, you know, hey, you know, we'll help sell advertising with our engine and
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.660]   we'll give you access to 200 million users.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.580]   I think other podcasts and use our tool Anchor to do it.
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:57.700]   Other podcasts, they might be able to generate quite a bit of content that way.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:02.900]   What do you think about the fact that like Spotify is doing this now a few years after
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.900]   podcasts?
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.420]   I mean, serial and all that sort of stuff.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:10.460]   Like it's interesting Apple has done their play, you know, various other companies have
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.460]   done their play.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.460]   I think we haven't seen the end of it.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.980]   Daniel, like himself says, we've got a half a billion dollars we want to spend on acquisitions.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.620]   So there may be more acquisitions.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:22.140]   Pandora, which has been struggling just as Spotify has with the record industry is also
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.420]   trying to figure out what to do.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.460]   They've gone into podcasting big.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:29.780]   I don't think Apple needs to because they have another revenue stream right here.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:35.220]   But Apple's, you know, if Apple had decided to do this way back when they could have.
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:42.260]   I think Apple wisely said we don't want to become a sole source for podcasts.
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:47.020]   We like to support podcasts with iTunes and they do, but we don't want to be a gatekeeper.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.620]   Spotify, I don't think mines.
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:53.700]   In fact, Spotify has changed their terms of service at the same time as they announced
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.980]   this to explicitly ban ad blockers.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.140]   You'll actually be kicked off the Spotify service if you try to block ads.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.900]   Now, that's for free users.
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:06.140]   Remember, there's no ads for paid users, at least for now.
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:07.780]   But that's kind of interesting.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:11.660]   They're looking at the Netflix and Hulu model of original content being big drivers,
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:16.340]   the subscribers and being this, you know, thing, thing that you sign up for, right?
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:21.700]   So you hear like, oh, this, I don't know, names, a good Netflix original show.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.740]   I don't know, Orange is a new black.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.180]   That's, I guess that's old, but, but people are talking about it and they're like, I don't
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.540]   want to sign up for Spotify to hear that podcast.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.540]   I don't know.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.260]   If I really like him, let's shows.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:37.420]   I don't know if they have the power to do that.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:41.860]   I certainly hope that Spotify doesn't make all their shows exclusive.
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.340]   I'm really interested in just podcasting as a medium getting better.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.460]   I feel like it's been kind of stagnant.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:54.780]   Like, there's still no good ways to get like transcripts or stats or like real numbers
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:55.780]   about it.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.020]   It doesn't feel like the way that podcasts are distributed and the way that people can
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:03.940]   consume them have gotten better beyond the occasional like good client or, or, you know,
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:04.940]   or service.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.940]   I don't know.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.940]   I'd be interested to hear from you, Leo.
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.300]   Like you've been at this for years and years and years like, and you have built out this
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:15.620]   whole infrastructure, it's with to do live streaming, you know, video and distribute the
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.140]   audio across all the different mediums.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:22.060]   Like what, what would you like to see to make just podcasting in general as a medium,
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:25.620]   not specific to a particular company or, or product, like be better?
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.780]   What could be better about it?
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:27.780]   I like the idea.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:28.780]   Anchor's really cool.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.700]   So I think that making it easy for people to make podcasts and maybe even make some money
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.700]   on podcasts because of Spotify's advertising engine.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.780]   I have no problem with that.
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.780]   I think that's great.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:43.380]   But I've seen, we've seen before in the past, others try to kind of take over podcasting
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:45.780]   by creating a giant podcast network.
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.080]   Remember MeeVio?
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.780]   And they had very restrictive contracts that made it very hard for podcasters to go elsewhere.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:56.140]   I don't like the idea of podcasters getting locked in to any platform because I think
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:59.140]   really the strength of podcasting is very much like the strength of the internet like
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:02.700]   blogging, which is that it's democratizing, that it's easy to make one.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.220]   It's almost as easy to make a podcast as it is a blog.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.620]   There's this issue of discovery.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:11.620]   But you know, I don't want to see Spotify become the next YouTube.
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:15.220]   And at this point, if you create video content, you've got to be on YouTube.
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.060]   Google owns it basically.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:18.340]   That's where you go.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:22.660]   Others have tried, Facebook's tried and Facebook watches and a big success.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:26.740]   I think a lot of people listening probably even know that exists.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:30.500]   So Vimeo is profitable, but it's not really a competitor to YouTube.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.500]   YouTube owns that space.
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:37.460]   I hate to see Spotify become the place to get audio content because I do think podcasting
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.460]   is great.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:45.020]   It's very vital in the sense that it's very active and growing and it's exciting.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.020]   You hear new things.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:50.180]   The other thing that worries me a little bit, Gimlet has a very distinct style.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:57.860]   Gimlet like a number of other startups was created by NPR refugees and has a very NPR
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.620]   sound to it, which we don't, by the way, we don't do.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:03.780]   We don't do our shows like that.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:08.340]   Our shows more sound like radio and talk shows because I'm a radio background.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.300]   They are all storytelling.
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:13.180]   They always begin with a little music.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:18.380]   Alex was walking down the street when something unusual happened.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.380]   There's a style.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:23.300]   There's a distinctive style, which people love.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.300]   I'm not saying that.
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:30.780]   They love it, but I would hate to see podcasts all sound the same.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:35.220]   So I think a monoculture is bad for anything.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:39.780]   It sounds like they're trying to thread the needle where Spotify wants to be loved.
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:45.180]   They want to take the Netflix model and get a whole bunch of new voices and cherish those
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:48.340]   voices and make them more popular and more easy.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.220]   But if you can avoid the, well, I guess down the road, they have to worry if they're so
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:56.140]   successful that you become the only place where podcasts.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.180]   That's the risk that they could become like YouTube.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.260]   The reason people go to YouTube because it's free, right?
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.580]   I put my stuff there.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.580]   They'll sell ads.
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:03.580]   I might even make some money.
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:04.940]   Some people make a lot of money.
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.940]   That's exactly, in my opinion, what Spotify is going to position itself as is the YouTube
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.740]   of podcasting.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:14.900]   And that has, I think that's a bad thing if they become too powerful.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:18.100]   So Spotify has two offers.
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.820]   They have a free version and they have a paid version.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:25.380]   So let's take "Climetown," for example, which is, I understand it eventually after
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:30.620]   it's had its run, they'll kind of set it free on the open podcast market.
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:38.380]   But if you want to listen to the podcast, "Climetown" is a podcast when it is released
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:45.260]   and you're a free user, will you hear ads, whereas if you are a paid subscriber, will
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.260]   you not hear ads?
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:47.500]   Is that how it will work?
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.660]   That's not clear, but that would be my guess.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:50.900]   That's how they do music right now.
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:54.820]   If you listen to Spotify's music without paying for it, you get ads, right?
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:56.140]   In fact, a lot of them.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:57.980]   It's $16 million last year.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:59.900]   That's a lot of money.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.060]   So why is what they estimated?
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.980]   The podcast industry made.
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:12.500]   So if you like, say, reply all, but you hate listening to ads, are you willing to pay Spotify
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:15.500]   in order to listen to it without ads?
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.300]   I'm sure that's their plan, right?
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:18.820]   So how do you transition?
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:19.820]   It's interesting.
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:25.740]   A lot of people love Patreon and I think they only take a 5% cut or some small cut.
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:28.620]   That's by the way, is really jump-started podcasting.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:30.620]   A lot of podcasters do.
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.620]   Right.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:34.300]   So how long the spectrum of the cut do you become the bad guy?
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.300]   You become what?
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.060]   You think of it as YouTube or whatever?
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.860]   Well, you don't even know what YouTube takes.
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:42.580]   They won't say and nobody's saying, but I think it's a fairly...
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:44.220]   It's more than 5% more than 5%
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:45.220]   They're not significantly more.
[01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:46.220]   They're not significantly more.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:49.020]   Yeah, I would say it's more than half, probably.
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.220]   That's a very interesting question.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:57.700]   I think in the long run, anything that helps podcasters create podcasts, monetize it and
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:01.260]   distribute it and be discovered is good.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.940]   In that case, this is a good thing.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.540]   I'd hate for it to become a monoculture.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.020]   That would be a bad thing.
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:15.020]   And if every podcast started to sound like a gimlet podcast, I'd be very unhappy.
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.020]   That's totally fair.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:20.460]   I think for people new to podcast, a gimlet style might be a good sort of entry point,
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:24.060]   but I don't know, but I totally agree with you, Leo.
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:27.900]   I mean, this is ironic because we just talked about how we wanted to live without these big
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:33.980]   companies, but I've always wished and hoped that Google would take on making podcasts
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.500]   better, more discoverable, easier to search.
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:42.820]   I feel like there's so much fertile ground there to make podcasts just more mainstream,
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:47.260]   even then they become much more mainstream, but even more so.
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:48.900]   That Google do something...
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:52.020]   I mean, the problem with podcasts is their audio.
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:55.420]   And so you don't have a text to index to spider.
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:56.420]   Could Google do that?
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:57.420]   Right.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:58.420]   Absolutely they could do that.
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:21:59.420]   Definitely.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:03.820]   There's something in the rundown about transcribe, which doesn't just transcribe, but tries to
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:05.220]   do punctuation and capitalization.
[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.500]   This is a really cool product from Google.
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.140]   Let's you do real-time subscription.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:14.500]   If you're deaf or perhaps you don't speak a language, you could put the phone down and
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.140]   it would tell you what's...
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.140]   That's awesome.
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:20.860]   And apparently you can get, "I got a new jersey in New Jersey and get the capitalization
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:21.860]   right."
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.700]   I have been waiting for the point where I can just dictate my emails instead of typing
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:26.700]   them for a long time.
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.380]   We're pretty close.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:31.580]   And so if they can do that and if they could get the discovery part...
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:35.420]   And by the way, maybe the podcast model where you're like, "I have to listen to every single
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:38.540]   episode of, you know, pick your favorite podcast.
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.540]   Maybe that's broken.
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:43.900]   Maybe it's just show me the one podcast that's super relevant to me because Gina's on it,
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.900]   you know, or something.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:49.020]   That episode is the one that I want and I don't have to listen to every single one.
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.020]   So this is a web...
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.020]   Yeah, singles versus albums.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:55.340]   It's called Inverse, or I...
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:23:01.940]   Yeah, Inverse, where they used Google's transcription against a rap song by Twista.
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.500]   Let's see how...
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:10.020]   Let's see how well it does.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:13.940]   It's doing so much better than I am.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:15.420]   It's...
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.540]   Twist is fast.
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.540]   He's got the flow.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:26.540]   I'll be honest with you, I don't know if it's accurate.
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.540]   No, I can't tell.
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.380]   We need better data.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.380]   But it's fast.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:32.380]   It's keeping up with him.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:33.620]   And it looks pretty credible.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:38.060]   I mean, it saw Jimmy Choo, which I would not have known.
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.060]   That's what he was saying.
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:43.300]   He says, "I'ma get you Jimmy Choo and I'll get the bags."
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.300]   He got it right.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.300]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:50.540]   And, post-lay, we have a podcast called Track Changes and we pay a production company who's
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:53.020]   great to do all of our transcripts.
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.740]   But yeah, it's an investment.
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:59.100]   It's a bigger investment than an individual could make, but to make all of our transcripts
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:02.740]   searchable and add in all the links and the show notes and all that stuff, that's a lot
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:03.740]   of work.
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:04.740]   You know that, Leo.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:07.540]   Yeah, it's very expensive to get it done right.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:11.460]   On the other hand, it wouldn't have to be done that well for it to be usable as an indexing
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:12.460]   search.
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.460]   That's right.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:14.460]   It's so close.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.460]   Transcribe well, Discovery could work well.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.380]   You could bookmark specific audio.
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:22.820]   You could be like, "Just show me the relevant part of this two-hour episode."
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.020]   I mean, that would be really interesting.
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.180]   It also is excellent for reporting.
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:32.100]   If you're a reporter and you're out in the field and you are making a recording as well
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:38.140]   as using this, it would cut down the time it would take to do your transcription dramatically.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.140]   That is the secret for that.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.140]   I'm probably the single biggest problem.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:44.040]   I think most people start podcasts right now aren't trying to make a living.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.260]   Maybe you don't even expect to make any money.
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:47.980]   But they would like listeners.
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:49.740]   And Discovery is impossible.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:55.720]   If you're not a big name or on a big name network or you can't get, honestly, the number
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.660]   one most important thing for any podcaster to do is to convince Apple to feature you
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.480]   on either New or No Worthy or on the weekly thing.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.880]   That is huge.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.900]   That could put a podcast on the map.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.460]   But how do you do that if you're just some guy from Brooklyn?
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:12.180]   I don't know why I'm picking on Brooklyn.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:16.200]   But if you're just some guy from Brooklyn, I don't know how you do that.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   That's the biggest problem.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.600]   Right now, the big issue if you're starting a podcast is how will I get anybody to listen
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:22.600]   to me?
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.320]   I mean, it's the same problem with bloggers or anything else.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.440]   If you're a YouTuber, you have that same problem.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.920]   There's no magic there either.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.120]   But I think search would help.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.120]   I don't know.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   What do we do?
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   How do we solve this, Matt?
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.440]   Could I make it just a little more dystopian?
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.440]   Yes.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.440]   Okay.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.640]   So what is a podcast?
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.680]   It is maybe it's produced, but it's a segment of audio.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:46.320]   I could imagine a world in which people could be convinced to just take their phone and
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.020]   have it be always recording what they're saying and have it be completely personalized
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:52.020]   for your search.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:56.580]   So I was on a phone call on the drive up here and I could just be like, you know what?
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:00.220]   Show me the meeting that I was in and go to the highlight.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.800]   And you could be like, oh yes.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.780]   It turns out this person did steal this person's idea or oh, there were microaggressions or
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:10.660]   I did interrupt this person and you could score based on how much of a good actor.
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:16.340]   You are like, there's a whole world in which Google or whoever had that technology could
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:17.900]   be like, you're being a jerk.
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:21.060]   I'm just doing the microaggressions.fm right now.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:25.020]   I don't see what's the microaggressions and ideas.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:26.020]   That's amazing.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:28.940]   You know, you know what sentiment analysis we can do.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:30.940]   You can do sentiment analysis.
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:34.700]   You could say, oh, I need to remember to blank and it could automatically export that
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.580]   and put it into to do.text.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:38.940]   Like, why do I?
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:43.740]   So now this is the flip side of the privacy issue we were talking about earlier.
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:48.020]   I can almost guarantee you that those have, you've been in the meetings, I'm sure, where
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:52.420]   that's been pitched and people said, no, that's a private, we will run up against a privacy
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.500]   buzz saw here.
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:56.620]   It crosses the creepy line even though it's a great thing people would love.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:57.860]   We've got to be careful here.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.420]   Don't you think that happens?
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:02.700]   You know, if somebody opted into it and it was localized or encrypted.
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:03.700]   Why is no problem with it?
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:04.700]   Yes.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:07.300]   You know, like if it were only for you and not for anybody else.
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:10.340]   Yeah, everybody would say, oh, Google just wants to listen to our calls.
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:15.420]   Well, you could have a checkbox that says, you know, in aggregate, can I send the information?
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:18.020]   Because then you would really be able to transcribe stuff well.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:20.620]   I love the idea.
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:22.220]   I don't care if it crosses the creepy line.
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:23.220]   I want it.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.220]   That's brilliant, Matt.
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:26.860]   Tell Google Home to turn it on.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:27.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.500]   Well, and so I'm looking at anchor.fm, which is the other company.
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:35.340]   We don't know how much Spotify paid for them, but this is easily the simplest way to make
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:36.340]   a podcast.
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:38.260]   They have apps for iOS and Android.
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:39.460]   You record on your phone.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.220]   You can easily put music behind it.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.500]   You can incorporate calls.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.500]   I've been doing that.
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:50.180]   I have a little podcast because I wanted to play with it called Leo on the Line at Lottle
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.180]   Fun.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.540]   L-O-T-L-F-U-N.F-U-N.
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:59.620]   And it's very easy to make these podcasts.
[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:03.620]   And I've done it all on my phone and you can incorporate other people's questions into
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:08.740]   your shows, which I've been doing, which is a lot of fun.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:12.700]   Now I have a podcast and now we're going to really need this, but I can see people going
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:13.980]   crazy about this.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:20.340]   What if you added this feature to an Amazon Echo or a Google Home?
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:21.340]   Record my show.
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:22.340]   Right.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.540]   You could easily do that.
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:29.340]   So that's why a Spotify acquisition could take the air out of this kind of innovation.
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.860]   You don't want one company to be so dominant.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.940]   So that's why I think it's great.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.860]   I'm glad Spotify put the money into this.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:37.860]   And now let's...
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.340]   And yeah, I don't want...
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:43.460]   Boy, when Apple came out with podcasting and iTunes, I think I blogged.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:46.860]   This is both the worst thing that could happen to podcasting and the best thing.
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.540]   And that's always the risk when these big players come in.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.980]   Apple's turned out to be a pretty good steward at podcasting.
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:56.420]   Although they wield huge influence.
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:57.420]   Google could do the same thing.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:58.420]   In fact, I was very disappointed.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.260]   Google has a podcast tool, but they would put a lot of energy into it.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:04.060]   I'd like to see them put more energy into it.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.540]   Somebody says it's micro aggregations.
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:11.180]   I like the idea.
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:15.420]   Let's take a little break, come back with more.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.420]   Gina Tarpani.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:17.420]   She's a...
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:18.420]   She's a...
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:19.420]   She's a...
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.620]   From a post-lata com.
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.620]   So nice to have you.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:26.340]   Mr. Dwight Silverman, who...
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:31.220]   Now tell me, remind me, because you were on with us January 2010.
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:37.940]   When Steve Jobs announced the iPad, remind me, did you love it or hate it?
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:38.940]   The iPad at the time?
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.380]   Yeah, I think you loved it.
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:41.380]   I did love it.
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:43.100]   I thought it had great potential.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.820]   It was clearly a 1.0.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:48.020]   I think a lot of people realize that.
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:51.340]   And I still use mine every day.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:54.380]   I know a lot of people kind of fall out of love with it.
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.380]   But it's...
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:57.460]   I think it's an excellent product.
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:29:59.460]   See, there you go.
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:04.020]   That's how long Dwight's been pontificating on our network.
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.180]   Matt Cutz is also here.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.020]   He is a big shot.
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:12.020]   He is Colonel Cutz of the United States Digital Service.
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.020]   I probably shouldn't do that.
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.220]   You're going to go home and you're going to get a lot of...
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.220]   I'll get in trouble.
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:17.220]   That's fine.
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.220]   That's fine.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.220]   At Matt Cutz on the Twitter.
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:20.220]   You still use the Twitter?
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:21.220]   Absolutely.
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.620]   Do you miss the Google Plus?
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:25.220]   I just choose Google Takeout to export my Google Plus.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.220]   Oh man.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.220]   So I can save it off.
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:31.620]   That's a perfect example of something great that Google did.
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:37.740]   I thought great should have been the premier social network because it had threaded conversations.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:41.660]   It had, as Mike Elgand has said, many times the tools you needed to moderate and block
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:44.540]   bad content, it had such potential.
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:45.540]   I don't know what went wrong.
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.540]   It makes me sad.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:49.180]   Well, and they put so many cycles into that.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.180]   Oh, I know.
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:53.180]   And if they had put those cycles into pick your enterprise...
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.180]   Google Wave.
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:55.180]   Like that.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.180]   Aww.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.180]   That was mean.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.820]   That twisted the knife right there.
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:02.500]   That's so mean.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:06.300]   Just for those who don't know, Gina wrote a book about Google Wave.
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:09.900]   The only, probably book ever written about Google Wave.
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:14.580]   It's like the punchline of my career, although it's been long enough now that young folks
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.580]   are like, what?
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:16.580]   Like, I'm starting to not work as much.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:19.300]   No one even knows what Google Wave is anymore.
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:20.300]   It's true.
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:25.540]   By the way, you could still get a $25 on Amazon if you'd like to get a copy.
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:28.340]   Oh, Leo, you're killing me right now.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:30.780]   You are killing me.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:31.980]   That is amazing.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.060]   We all have those.
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:35.460]   I want to get you to autograph my copy.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.500]   Yeah, we all have plates exactly right.
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.500]   We all have those.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.500]   I appreciate that.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.500]   Thank you.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.500]   Oh, it's out of stock.
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.300]   Oh, out of stock.
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:44.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:47.860]   Well, at least I can get the Kindle edition still.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.820]   Man.
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:53.540]   Is Wave in any way alive?
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:56.340]   Is there any like, yeah.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:00.980]   So like Wave proper, I think Apache, it turned into an open source project and Apache took
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:01.980]   it over.
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:04.620]   But the way that Wave is still alive is in Google Docs.
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:08.980]   Google Docs has live typing and comments and like those things are kind of like blue,
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:14.980]   at least blue my mind in 2009 when it got demoed at Google IO.
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:18.700]   Like that stuff all kind of lived on in other Google products that we all sort of use every
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:22.140]   day, but it's just not called, not called Wave.
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:29.220]   And I'm sad to say that the Git repository is gone, but there is an Apache incubator website,
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:32.140]   so they do have something going on.
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:36.980]   I think they may have, I don't know, I may be remembering wrong, but I think at some
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:41.940]   point Apache may have put it into the last news post was 2013.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:42.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:43.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:45.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:46.940]   Zombie mode.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:47.940]   Zombie mode.
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.740]   That's too bad because it was a really interesting collaborative platform.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:52.900]   Obviously you thought it was, you wrote a book about it.
[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:55.780]   Yeah, for the time it was incredible what it was in the time.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:56.780]   But you're right.
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:58.820]   We have a lot of those features now in Google Docs.
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:32:59.820]   We do.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:00.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.900]   Our show today brought to you by Hate Developers.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:05.020]   You know this name Atlassian.
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:10.180]   If you are a developer and you're not using Atlassian's Jira tool, man, I don't know how
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:11.180]   you survive.
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:15.500]   Jira keeps track of your issues, keeps track of your development, who's doing what, when
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:23.380]   you can move that Jira column over to completed and I love that.
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:24.380]   We've used Jira for years.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:27.780]   Actually, we're in Atlassian house because it just starts with Jira, but Atlassian has
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:29.860]   a bunch of tools.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:31.900]   And it's really about collaboration.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:38.060]   Tools that empower IT teams around the world and the people who work with those IT teams.
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:43.500]   This is a tough world with complicated software out there, complicated relationships.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:47.140]   One of the reasons we love Atlassian is because Jira helps us keep track of who's doing what
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.620]   and then it naturally flows into confluence.
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:55.020]   It's so important for us that we have documentation of our processes.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:34:00.980]   And then Bitbucket, if you have a code database, is a great way to keep track of your code.
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:01.980]   But there's a whole lot more.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.620]   There's now Ops Genie, Status Page.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:07.580]   They acquired Trello, another great project manager.
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:09.380]   Look, it's not just for developers.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:14.580]   Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable suite of tools for teams of all sizes, from DevOps
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:19.740]   to Agile IT apps to Ops to ITSM and whatever's next.
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:23.700]   Jira Confluence Bitbucket, Ops Genie, Status Page.
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.260]   Here's what you do.
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:30.820]   Go right now to Atlassian.com and find the tool for your IT team.
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:36.820]   It's easy, it's free to try, and they will scale to whatever you need them to do.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:41.780]   So many big companies in small use Atlassian software.
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:43.860]   It will grow with you.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:47.380]   Like of all of Atlassian's products, the tools for your team are easy and free to try at
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:54.820]   at Atlassian.com/IT@lassian.com/IT.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.340]   We're proud to be in Atlassian house.
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:58.140]   I say it all the time.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:07.820]   We use it and we recommend it at Atlassian.com/IT.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:08.820]   Well this has been so much fun.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:11.340]   Let me find some more grist for the mill.
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:16.300]   Apple is going to pay back taxes to French authorities.
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:22.980]   In fact, if you looked at the alphabet results and their tax bill, their tax rate was 139
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:27.420]   percent last year, but it was 11 percent this quarter.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.020]   That's because of repatriation, right?
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:31.100]   Getting that money back.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.940]   But Apple apparently had a vast amount of backdated tax.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.260]   French media estimated to be $571 million.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.980]   Apple confirmed they have paid the taxes back.
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:45.340]   They didn't say exactly how much.
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:50.260]   You know, it's a lot of money for you and me.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:52.660]   Not that much for Apple.
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:55.100]   Not that much for Apple.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:36:01.340]   You know, I don't know exactly what to say about these multinational companies and their
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:02.580]   tax.
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:04.060]   I wish I could do it, I guess.
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:11.500]   But on the other hand, as an individual who pays almost, I don't know what it is, 40 percent
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.300]   compared to Google's 11 percent.
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:17.900]   I'm actually glad to pay taxes because this country made it possible for us to do what
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:19.500]   we do.
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:27.620]   We use the roads, we use all the services of the US government, the US Digital Service,
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:28.620]   our armed forces.
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.100]   I'm glad to pay taxes.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:34.180]   I think it would be appropriate for these tech companies to pay a little bit more.
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.620]   I understand why they don't.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:36.940]   They don't have to.
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:41.980]   So maybe there's something to be done there, if you know what I mean.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:43.780]   Angela Arrence, this was a big surprise.
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:46.620]   We're in the middle of Macbreak Weekly on Tuesday.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:54.540]   The news comes that the head of Apple retail, the CEO, they wooed away from Burberry.
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:58.540]   She was the CEO and became the head of Apple retail, which looked like a demotion.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:02.820]   She's been there five years as announced she's going to leave in a couple of months.
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.980]   I think it was a surprise to Apple because they announced they're replacing her with
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:10.500]   a longtime Apple executive who was in charge of HR.
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:12.860]   They call it people at Apple.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:17.420]   We'll be now senior vice president of retail plus people.
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:20.860]   So it's my guess there's searching for replacement.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:23.940]   And this is an interim, although they did not say that.
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:31.620]   I didn't say why Arrence is leaving, but it's one of those where she wants to spend more
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:36.140]   time with her family, but she's looking for new personal and professional pursuits, according
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:37.140]   to Tim Cook.
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:40.540]   I'd love to know without that.
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:42.540]   But we never will.
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.980]   We'll never know.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:46.700]   We know there is a story.
[01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:47.700]   We don't know what the story is.
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:48.700]   She did it.
[01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:52.180]   She's done with a story there because they tell people it's not a thing.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.180]   Right.
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:54.180]   That's not a thing.
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:55.740]   No, it isn't.
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:38:01.660]   There had been rumors that she was a possible heir, a parent to the CEO position at Apple
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:05.380]   early on just because of her experience with Burberry.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:10.820]   But she has a real charisma when she was on stage.
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:13.780]   She was very compelling, I think.
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:18.820]   And so maybe there is a little friction there between Tim and Angela.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:19.820]   That is not unusual.
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:21.340]   We've seen it again and again.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:24.460]   I remember Stephen Elop left Microsoft when it was known.
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:28.300]   Microsoft was seeking a new CEO to replace Steve bomber.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:31.980]   Elop was in the running when he learned he wasn't going to be CEO.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.980]   He quit.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:38.020]   Actually, he turned out they hired a pretty good guy who's now just now celebrating his
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.700]   is it fifth anniversary CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:41.900]   Yeah, he's been doing a great job.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.540]   He's done an amazing job.
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:47.460]   And you could absolutely say, Aaron's has done an amazing job in retail.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.900]   It does make sense to what you say.
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.820]   I mean, she came from a CEO.
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:58.380]   It would be sensible if they said, well, look, Angela, come to Apple, help us with retail,
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:00.300]   do it for five years.
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:02.700]   And then you can be the CEO when Tim retires.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:03.700]   How old is Tim Cook?
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.420]   He's getting close to retirement age.
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:09.060]   He's in his 60s, nearly 60s.
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:14.980]   So although I have to say that you say she's done a good job, but if you go into any Apple
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:20.300]   store, it's so crowded and it's a very chaotic environment.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:23.500]   It's no longer kind of the Zen and chill that it used to be.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:30.220]   And if you try to get a genius bar appointment and you try, certainly it's almost impossible
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.300]   to walk in now.
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:37.900]   The whole process that of getting the personalized support is really kind of a mess.
[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:42.100]   And I'm not sure necessarily in that arena that she's done that good a job.
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:43.300]   She might have been too successful.
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:48.060]   I mean, the stores are just jammed with people buying Apple stuff.
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.060]   Is that true?
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.860]   I see that was a New York City thing.
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.860]   No, everywhere.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:53.860]   Everywhere.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:54.860]   It's everywhere.
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:55.860]   It's always.
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:40:00.660]   Even if like in our little Santa Rosa store, there's always, and you know, I think part of
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.460]   the problem, maybe this is her fault.
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:06.620]   But part of the problem is it's a great place and you feel like it's a completely okay to
[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:11.980]   browse and look and try not to buy, but just to go in there and hang out, answer you some
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:17.220]   email, you know, watch some TV.
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:19.220]   And I think they wanted to make it like that.
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:22.980]   But that as a result, you all every time I go in an Apple store, I can see there are
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:24.940]   a lot of people just hanging out there.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.740]   It's become a place to loiter.
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:28.340]   Victims of their own success.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:29.340]   Yeah.
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.340]   Not a bad thing.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:33.580]   I think they just need more stores, maybe.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:34.580]   They certainly.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:37.020]   I speculated on Twitter.
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:43.140]   I speculated on Twitter that there may be some value in breaking off the tech support
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:47.180]   and the genius bar environment from the retail environment.
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:48.580]   I mean, obviously you're there.
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:51.340]   You know, it's a chance to sell you something.
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:55.740]   But I also think that it's just it's become that system has become so overloaded that
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:57.540]   it's not even that useful anymore.
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.660]   And that's actually an interesting point.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:04.260]   They could have a separate little shop for the genius.
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.020]   Put them off to the side somehow.
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:07.020]   Right.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.020]   It's interesting.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:12.580]   Apple has done two things, I think, to protect your privacy.
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:19.500]   They're limiting accelerometer and gyroscope access in the next version of iOS 12.2 for
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:20.900]   privacy reasons.
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:25.020]   This is a new privacy feature in the next version of iOS, which will be coming in the
[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:26.980]   next month or two.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:36.340]   Turns out, in the past, motion and orientation information has been available to websites
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:37.340]   through Safari.
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:40.060]   It is now off by default.
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:44.940]   But there is a setting which the user has access to.
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.220]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:53.060]   Motion and orientation access is a new setting in iOS.
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:42:00.140]   I don't know of any exploits, but you can imagine that that might be something bad guys
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.140]   could use.
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:07.820]   We did see one theoretical exploit where you could figure out what somebody's unlock
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:14.660]   code was using the accelerometer and the gyroscope.
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:18.340]   So maybe that's the issue.
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:21.700]   Is there any other privacy issue with that?
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:27.300]   I mean, can you, would there be something not necessarily evil but...
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.740]   Well, Google in terms of bad times.
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:34.260]   Google has demonstrated the ability to detect gate, right?
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:40.700]   One of the issues that websites have is authentication, passwords and terrible method for authentication.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:44.420]   And gate analysis, the ability to say, "I know you're you because I can tell how you
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:49.620]   walk," which uses the accelerometer and gyroscope, "I guess could also be used against you as
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.900]   a way to identify you uniquely on the phone."
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.900]   That's wild, isn't it?
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:54.900]   Oh, you're Leo.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:57.340]   I could tell how you walk.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:58.780]   Just don't spray in your ankle.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:02.580]   Put a pebble in your shoe and you can't log in anymore.
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:04.580]   Don't put on shoes at her.
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:06.740]   Okay, it's just one of many factors.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:07.740]   Okay.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:10.300]   Combine it.
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:17.740]   Apple's also told app developers, "If you're going to record the screen, you have to disclose
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.980]   and get permission.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:27.060]   I didn't know this was an issue, but apparently apps have been using the ability to record,
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:32.820]   log or otherwise make a record of user activity without permission."
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:37.580]   Major companies like Expedia, Hollister and Hotels, according to TechCrunch, were using
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:42.700]   a third-party analytics tool to record every tap and swipe inside the app.
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.700]   Oh, so it's like it's UI analysis.
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.140]   It's like a heat map, right?
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.140]   Yeah, probably for AB testing.
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.100]   I've never seen this ad.
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:53.020]   What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:56.780]   I love that the irony of this ad is that it's a black shield over all these windows.
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:58.980]   Can you imagine being one of the apartments?
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:04.060]   There's even more irony because it was on a Marriott hotel in Los Angeles, which had,
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:07.220]   of course, it just experienced a massive security reach.
[01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:09.380]   There's a lot of layers here.
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:10.380]   A lot of layers.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:15.380]   And by the way, two weeks after that ad, Shodden Freud, or maybe it's...
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:17.660]   I'm not sure what the exact German word is.
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:24.220]   Apple got caught with that FaceTime bug that allowed people to listen to you on your iPhone.
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:25.220]   Real bad.
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.220]   Real bad.
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.020]   Our capital be real bad.
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:30.300]   And they fixed that this week.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:33.420]   This is the week they fixed it was the 12.1.4.
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:39.300]   There's an interesting aspect of that though because they made the mom of the kid reported
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:40.300]   via iOS.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:41.300]   So...
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:45.220]   Yeah, what happened was she tweeted it.
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:46.220]   Okay.
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:47.220]   Okay.
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:51.500]   So that's not exactly the report, but she did try to get it to Apple.
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:56.100]   At some point she contacted her local Fox News affiliate because she said, "My 14 year
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.220]   old has found this bug.
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:59.020]   I think this is a problem."
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:04.860]   And Apple finally said, "Well, you've got to do a bug radar report.
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:05.860]   That's how you have to report.
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:07.420]   And in order to do that, you have to be a developer."
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:08.420]   So they were essentially...
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:11.260]   They didn't say you have to be a developer, but they said, "Look, you need to report it
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.260]   through radar."
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:13.260]   Okay.
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.260]   And that meant you had to get...
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:17.380]   You can get a free developer account, but that's a lot of hoops to make somebody jump
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:18.380]   through.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.380]   Apple apologized.
[01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:20.700]   They said, "We're going to have a new...
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:21.700]   We're getting rid of that.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:25.060]   We're going to make it easier for the probably you can imagine though.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.060]   You've got...
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:27.060]   How many?
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:28.060]   What did they say?
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.380]   800 million, 900 million active iOS users.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:37.860]   If 1% of them report something every year, that's thousands of reports a day, and most
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:42.580]   of them are, "I can't figure out how to get home."
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:43.580]   And so...
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:48.780]   I'm trying to create a new YouTube channel that I can't brand by accident.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:50.540]   They're inundated with these.
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:51.540]   So I don't fully blame them.
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:56.740]   They actually, they've said, "We're going to pay the bug bounty to the kid, the 14-year-old,
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:58.780]   by contributing to his education."
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:02.700]   Well, you can't give a 14-year-old $25,000.
[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.700]   They just spent it on candy.
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.460]   They're doing that.
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.820]   No, not anymore.
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:13.820]   They're doing that by the pump posture.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.900]   Yeah, they're spending on Amazon TV products.
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:20.020]   I think it's a valid question though, because at least as I recall, to report security problems
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:25.220]   on Google, you used to use an email address, and it was security@google.com or something,
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.620]   and the problem is it got massively spammed.
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:30.380]   You'd have to have thousands of people going through that all the time.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:31.380]   And they did not.
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:32.380]   Right.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:35.260]   And so if you missed something, so what is the right reporting mechanism?
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:38.300]   Is it a webpage, a wizard?
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:44.420]   This is not new, not only Google and Apple, but Microsoft with 1809, their big fall release,
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:48.420]   had some really big showstoppers, including one that deleted data.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:51.700]   That's as bad as it gets with an operating system update, right?
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:56.660]   And it turned out that it had been reported by Windows Insiders months ago.
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.860]   And Microsoft just did they ignore it, did they miss it?
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:03.300]   I mean, you have this big beta program with Windows Insiders.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.620]   You're trying to get this kind of information.
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:08.460]   That's presumably a big, big deal.
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:14.860]   They should, if you were the person who said, "Oh my God, stop, can't release that."
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:15.860]   But they didn't.
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:19.900]   And so I think this is exactly the problem, is there's just too much data.
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.380]   How do you promote that?
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:22.380]   I mean, better systems.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:26.700]   I like these wide, you know, mass bug testing programs.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:30.540]   I think they're great, but if you ignore what you learn from it, that's not so useful.
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:31.540]   That's totally true.
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:32.540]   It's actually worse.
[01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:36.140]   Yeah, 12.14 will fix the FaceTime security flaw.
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:44.420]   Actually, fix is a number of other lesser publicized flaws in iOS.
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:47.780]   We talked about it on security now, if you want to know more.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:51.180]   The length of time that it took for them to issue the fix coupled with the fact that
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:55.500]   everybody knew that this bug existed is like, that's a deadly combination, right?
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:58.820]   You ideally either want the bug to come in through a private channel where the whole
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:00.780]   world doesn't know about it, right?
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:04.660]   So that people can't exploit it or you issue the fix almost immediately.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:09.420]   It really has to be one or the other, but this was just not handled well.
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:14.980]   So an open source developer in her chat room named Mandy the Clown says, I don't think
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:18.620]   she's a clown, not an open source developer, but I may be wrong.
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:20.820]   Says, "What about open source solve this?"
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:23.540]   But I don't think it would.
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:24.540]   Bugs happen.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.420]   If it's open source or not.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:30.760]   I mean, with open source, people are looking at the code, but there's always going to
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.620]   be bugs and flaws, right?
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:36.380]   It's how you respond to them, whether you're an open source organization or a giant company
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:38.140]   like Apple.
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.620]   There's a massive exploit in system D right now.
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.660]   The system that starts almost all Linux distributions.
[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:48.260]   It's a privilege escalation flaw.
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:50.260]   That's pretty serious, right?
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:58.900]   Three of them in system D, C V E 2018, 168, 64, 65 and 66.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:02.440]   It's in the journaling service.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.840]   Pretty much all Linux distros are subject to this.
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.840]   They're pretty serious.
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.200]   In fact, researchers have created proof of concept exploits, which fortunately have not
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.000]   yet been released.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]   This is open source.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.160]   This is open as you can get.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:22.520]   In fact, because system D is so widely used, I imagine there are lots of people looking
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.520]   at it.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.440]   It doesn't mean there's not flaws.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.440]   I was about to say, "Oh, and heart bleed just happened."
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:29.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:30.440]   Heart bleed.
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:31.440]   Four years ago.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.440]   I am old.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.440]   Heart bleed just happened.
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:37.140]   That just happened a couple of weeks ago.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.140]   Wow.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:41.740]   I haven't used open SSL since.
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:44.980]   But heart bleed is really a poster child for this, isn't it?
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:49.460]   In fact, we learned many things from heart bleed, including how important it is to have
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:51.020]   a good name for your exploit.
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:52.020]   That's true.
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:53.020]   You want a website.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.020]   Any other website.
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:56.020]   And a logo.
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:57.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:49:58.020]   Very nice.
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:03.340]   It's funny to me that if you're a company trying to help secure open source stuff like
[01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:07.280]   system D or things like that is probably a shortcut to goodwill.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:13.060]   If you have any kind of security thing, making your products better or more robust or getting
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:15.980]   the 14-year-old so they can report a bug is one thing.
[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:19.940]   But if you can make it so that you are helping with internet infrastructure or open source
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:25.360]   projects, you're competing for programmers and engineers.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.400]   If you can help with those kinds of things, people see that and I think they would help
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:29.720]   with their reputation.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.720]   You know those folks.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:35.840]   Programmers are not solely motivated by stock options and money.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:38.040]   I think a lot of coders want to make a difference.
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:39.040]   Absolutely.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:40.040]   That's why they go to USDS.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.040]   Totally true.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:45.440]   Although you guys pay huge salaries, we can pay up to $164,000 as part of the government.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.440]   So you don't have to sacrifice to come.
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.440]   That's actually not so bad.
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:49.440]   No, to make your government work better.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:50.440]   That's pretty cool.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.640]   And what is a typical term of service?
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:57.520]   An average person is now staying for a year in seven months, eight months.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:58.520]   Wow.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.520]   So you can come for three to six months.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.520]   I signed up for a six month tour.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:02.520]   You see what happened there?
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:03.520]   It was two and a half years ago.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:04.520]   So we warn you upfront.
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:07.720]   We will do commitment escalation.
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:12.040]   But you can stay for two years and then you can be renewed for another two-year term.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.040]   That's pretty cool.
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:15.000]   We've got some people who are just finishing up their four-year terms.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.560]   And can I call myself Colonel afterwards?
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:20.600]   We, you know, afterwards you can call yourself whatever you want.
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.120]   I'll call whatever you want on your last day of the job.
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.800]   I'll go tea and wear a little solo time.
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:26.800]   Wow.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.440]   Why don't you call myself Colonel upon?
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.360]   I'm a Colonel upon.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:38.600]   I'll never forget those days I worked in the service of our nation.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:39.600]   Colonel cuts.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:45.760]   Oh, here's the two iOS is zero days.
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:50.040]   This is why it's so important to install 12.1.4.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:53.520]   This is the great Google project.
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:54.520]   What is it?
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.640]   Zero Project Zero, they call it.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:59.800]   Ben Hawkes, team leader at Project Zero.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:04.440]   They didn't reveal what the hack was, but these are zero days that are already in the
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.320]   wild.
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:09.200]   That is pretty bad.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:15.720]   And so if you are an iOS user and you haven't yet installed 12.1.4, you might want to do
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:16.720]   that quickly.
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:22.080]   Zero days mean that they are exploited at the same time as they've been learned about.
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.680]   There's no time between the information.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.560]   And if you're interested in security stuff, I think Google just opensource Cluster Fuzz,
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.920]   which is their fuzzy application.
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:38.720]   Fuzzing is sending garbage into an application to see if you can crash it.
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:42.320]   And I think Cluster Fuzz can scale up to like 25,000 machines.
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:45.080]   So they use that to test out Chrome and all sorts of things.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.600]   Nothing is all the rage among the hackers.
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.600]   People love to find it.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.600]   Well, Cluster Fuzz is a great name.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:52.600]   That's a great name.
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:54.840]   Now you explain what it does.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.240]   I'm really appreciating the branding there.
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:52:59.240]   Security people have a good sense of humor.
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:03.560]   They really do.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:07.160]   There is now, this is an interesting, as long as we're talking about Apple exploits,
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:12.080]   and I don't know whether this is genuine or not, but there is a security researcher who
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:18.280]   has found a Mac OS exploit to access keychain passwords, a lot of important stuff in there,
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:24.320]   but is out of protest refusing to share it with Apple.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:31.920]   Linos Hensei has publicly shared iOS vulnerabilities in the past, so we know he's credible.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:35.640]   He's frustrated that Apple's Bug Bounty program does not apply to Mac OS.
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:37.000]   It only applies to iOS.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000]   Really?
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.880]   Yeah, this has been why, in fact, Apple only recently had a Bug Bounty program for a
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.880]   long time.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:46.640]   I kind of understand their point of view that if we start paying people for bugs, it escalates
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.840]   it.
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:49.560]   It makes it more expensive already.
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:53.080]   Governments, foreign governments are paying people for bugs.
[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:56.000]   We don't want to get in the business, but if you don't pay for bugs, you maybe don't
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.560]   hear about them.
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.520]   He's decided not to tell people about his keychain exploit.
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:02.680]   It's called the Keysteal.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:05.880]   But he put a demo, a video demo.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.360]   Oh, yeah, there's a video.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.360]   Of course.
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:10.880]   Wow, this is a lot of extortion and this has been this.
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:12.320]   This is the extortion episode.
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:16.080]   He's a shame if those pictures leaked out.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.080]   I'm just saying.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.760]   It'd be a shame if New York didn't welcome Amazon.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:24.400]   Wasn't the name of the medium post, though, really good.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.400]   Honestly.
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:27.360]   Oh, no thanks.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.000]   No thanks, Mr. Packer.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.920]   No, thank you, Mr. Packer.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:35.640]   All right, I said I wasn't going to talk about it, and I'm not.
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.720]   No, thanks, Mr. Packer.
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:38.600]   You know what we should do?
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:40.600]   We should make the title of the show.
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:42.800]   No thanks, Mr. Packer.
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:45.920]   And then everybody would listen to the show all the way to the end
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:47.680]   and say, well, wait a minute.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.680]   You didn't talk about it.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:51.400]   It's a bait and switch.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.760]   I want to take a little break, and then I
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.240]   have to laugh at Microsoft, because they've done the silliest
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.560]   thing I've ever heard of.
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:59.120]   You talked about it before the show.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:54:59.840]   Matt cuts--
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.120]   Oh, that's a great story.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.600]   Yes.
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.000]   It's a tease.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.720]   Although, I just want to say, Spotify,
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:08.480]   you could put in ad blockers, but there's no way
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:12.400]   you could prevent people from fast forwarding through the ad.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:14.720]   And so teases really don't work in podcasts,
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.680]   because anybody who wants to hear what we're talking about
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:18.040]   has already skipped this part.
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.160]   Now, miss the good stuff.
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:22.520]   You're missing the good stuff.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:25.640]   I'm going to quick come up with something good.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:27.720]   Let's roll the promo.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.720]   Previously, on to it.
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:33.640]   I still, even though I haven't done carts or DJ'd in years,
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:37.000]   I still have nightmares that your headphones are wrapped
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.480]   around your head, and you can't reach the cart,
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:41.400]   and the songs ending, and the record.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.520]   Do you ever have dreams like that, Carson?
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.240]   Those are not the Leo dreams I have.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:49.680]   OK, back to the change log.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:54.200]   All about Android.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:55.840]   We've got questions, Michelle.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.320]   You have to imagine a lot of people
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:59.560]   are wishing they had what you have,
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:03.040]   which is in a very early build of Android Q.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:06.720]   So Google is adding a new category of permissions
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:08.200]   called roles.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:10.080]   What I think Google is planning on doing
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:13.800]   is the user says, I want this app to have this role,
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.480]   then all the other permissions that are relevant to that role
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.880]   will be automatically granted.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.920]   So say like you have a gallery app.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:21.960]   You want to have a gallery role.
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.400]   Then it'll automatically be granted any permission that's
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.080]   relevant to gallery apps.
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.400]   Let's hands on tech.
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:29.960]   Does Tesla have some serious competition from Jaguars
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:32.400]   all-wheel drive luxury crossover the eyepace?
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.720]   This feels like a Jaguar.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:34.560]   It feels pretty nice.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:35.400]   It does, yeah.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.160]   Jaguar, they're starting to build EVs,
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:40.560]   but they want to make them so that they fit in with the rest
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.120]   of their lineup to it.
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:44.560]   Test drive one today.
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:47.640]   Let me talk about WordPress, because I am a big WordPress fan.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:50.880]   I got my 12-year badge just the other day at WordPress.com.
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:53.040]   12 years I've been using WordPress.com.
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:55.960]   And I started using WordPress before WordPress.com existed.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:57.800]   When Matt Mullenweig first created it,
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:00.840]   I was looking for a great tool for my website
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.960]   that would make it easy.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:03.520]   At the time, I called it a blogging tool,
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.160]   but really it's a professional-grade content management
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:10.400]   system that allows you to easily post, create a website,
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.800]   make it look beautiful, put in all the features you want,
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.480]   including e-commerce as simply as possible.
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:17.880]   That's WordPress.com.
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.320]   And what a success.
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:23.360]   WordPress powers 33% of the internet.
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.240]   One third of the entire net is running on WordPress.
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.080]   I think that's as good as success as you can get.
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:30.480]   That's-- it powers my site.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.160]   Me too.
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.240]   LeoLoport.com.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:34.320]   And I'm on WordPress.com for a long time.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.960]   When it first came out, there wasn't a WordPress.com.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:40.360]   I had to buy a server.
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.760]   I had to provision it.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.680]   Of course, I spent most of my time messing around with it,
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:48.800]   trying to get plugins to work, getting the security to work.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:50.960]   When WordPress.com came along, I realized, not only
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:53.200]   am I saving money, it's less expensive.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:53.960]   I'm saving time.
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:54.920]   They keep it secure.
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:56.480]   They keep it up to date.
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:59.160]   So you can pursue what you love.
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:01.560]   You can create your own site without being a geek,
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:03.440]   without wasting time on any of that.
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.680]   Just put your time into the content.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.200]   And the other thing I love about WordPress, it's your site.
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:09.560]   It's your content.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:11.960]   It's not Mark Zuckerberg's content.
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:13.880]   It's not Jack's content.
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:15.400]   It's your content.
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.720]   And that means you can upload text, audio, video, music,
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:23.880]   photos to your WordPress site, download it anytime you want.
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:26.240]   It's always under your control.
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:27.480]   I think that's so important.
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:28.440]   Everybody.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.760]   I don't-- yes, if you're a business,
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.960]   you should have a Facebook page and a Twitter feed and all
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:32.440]   that.
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:35.000]   But you also need your own place, your own site,
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.200]   that everything links back to.
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:39.600]   That's your WordPress.com site.
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:41.720]   It was started so anyone could publish their ideas.
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:44.280]   And I think it's really been a huge success.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:46.720]   No two-week trials, no hidden fees,
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.240]   users own their own content.
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:51.440]   I actually do the business plan because I want--
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:53.280]   I mean, those features are so great.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:55.640]   Now everybody gets help 24 hours a day,
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:58.360]   including weekends from not just customer support people
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:01.320]   reading a notebook, but actual WordPress experts.
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:04.120]   WordPress.com, flexible, powerful.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:05.800]   Some of the biggest companies on the Earth
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.000]   use it to build their websites.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.320]   Some of us little guys too.
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:10.320]   I love WordPress.
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:12.200]   Go to WordPress.com/twit.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:15.320]   You can get 15% off any new plan purchase right now.
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:19.560]   WordPress.com/twit.
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:22.680]   WordPress.com/twit.
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:25.800]   And if you go to Matt's site--
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:27.040]   You go to Matt's site.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.960]   MattCuts.com/blog.
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:35.800]   You will see the one and only Matt cuts as a lobster.
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:37.520]   So one of the things--
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:38.040]   Oh, sorry.
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:38.960]   That's a crab.
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:39.560]   It's a crab.
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:41.080]   How could I be so wrong?
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:43.320]   One of the things that we have at the US General Service
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.500]   is this idea of crab claws.
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.160]   Because when you've got somebody on the phone,
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:49.360]   you don't want to be clapping real loud and mess up the audio.
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:53.200]   And so when we do these crab claws, it's become a thing.
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:55.360]   And so now I'm happy to dress up as a crab.
[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:56.720]   I've got to visualize this.
[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:58.120]   So you've got a bunch of people.
[01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:00.320]   They're on the phone talking to people.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.520]   And you want to applaud, but you don't.
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:03.560]   So you go like this?
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:05.480]   Well, you applaud so that you don't
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:06.840]   annoy the people who are on the phone.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:09.040]   So you'll see these big staff meetings and everybody's going,
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:09.880]   oh, in the meeting.
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:10.400]   Great job.
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:10.960]   Great job.
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:11.400]   I see.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:11.400]   So like--
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:12.400]   Yeah, like an all hands.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:13.640]   If they're on conference calls--
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:15.000]   And it's super annoying.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:15.520]   --it's just as annoying.
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:16.200]   Yeah.
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:16.960]   So great job.
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:17.840]   What about fingers crossed?
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.840]   We do the soft clap.
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:20.200]   But I think we want to take--
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:20.700]   Crab claws.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:21.400]   --do the crab claws.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.120]   We don't have to do it.
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:25.080]   So the strange thing is this is also, I think, sign language for no.
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:28.080]   So a lot of people are like, what?
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:29.360]   Are you saying we're talking too much?
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:30.120]   Is that the problem?
[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:30.620]   That's nice.
[02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:31.640]   We didn't pick it that well.
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:33.080]   And this was your Halloween costume?
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:33.960]   It was.
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.640]   You were the cutest person alive.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.680]   You really, really are.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.120]   That's amazing.
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:41.240]   How could you look at this picture and not say,
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.840]   that is the cutest person alive?
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:44.840]   Well, I'd really like to work with that person.
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.760]   They've got their life together, huh?
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:49.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, you too could work for this guy.
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:50.520]   Colonel Kutz.
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:51.040]   Yes.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:51.520]   Colonel Kutz.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:53.280]   Colonel Krabby Kutz.
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:55.640]   By the way, the back was like a backpack.
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.680]   So you could slip some liquor or something, because it's
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:58.160]   messed up.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.800]   You could smuggle a bunch of stuff in your carapace.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:01.240]   I don't know.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:02.840]   Oh, wow.
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:04.360]   Carapace is not included.
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:06.640]   Wow.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:07.720]   Did you wear it to work?
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:08.920]   I did not.
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.520]   I could have, but I decided, you know what?
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:11.480]   Just put this on at home.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:13.960]   What do people do like at the Department of Defense on Halloween?
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.320]   Do they come in in costumes?
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.560]   Some people do.
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:16.920]   Really?
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:17.960]   Some people do.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:21.160]   Yeah, well, whenever we walk around the Pentagon, we wear hoodies.
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:22.440]   And that is enough of a costume.
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:23.400]   That's terrifying.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:24.920]   People don't know what to make of us.
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:25.960]   That's terrifying.
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:26.880]   Hoodies and flip-flops.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:29.440]   You're in suit culture and country there.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:30.920]   It is suit culture.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:36.160]   You're in Scram and the X4 star uniform country.
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:37.600]   Yeah.
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.600]   Microsoft begs you to stop using inter-
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:43.520]   Yeah, explore.
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:44.360]   Oh my god.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:47.360]   This is not your grandpa's Microsoft.
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:50.360]   They're also putting out a series of cringy ads featuring
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:55.360]   twins suggesting you shouldn't use Office 2019 anymore.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:56.360]   Huh.
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:57.360]   What?
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:58.360]   Oh, you got a set.
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:01:59.360]   What?
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:00.360]   What?
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:05.640]   I mean, it's cool that Microsoft is saying get rid of Internet Explorer because all of
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:07.360]   us are saying get rid of Internet Explorer.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:08.360]   Yeah, who was it?
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:13.360]   The guy who does Internet Explorer said, no, no, it's not a browser.
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.360]   It's a compatibility layer.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:19.200]   A compatibility solution.
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:20.200]   What is that?
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.520]   That is so bad.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:29.400]   So his argument was that you use it when you have a application or something that you
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:36.200]   created internally that from back in the day, that runs on Internet Explorer.
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:41.440]   So every version of Windows, including the latest comes with Internet Explorer, but they
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.440]   hide it.
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.280]   They're not supposed to use it.
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:45.280]   So what do you use?
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:46.280]   Now you've questioned.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:47.280]   Is it Edge?
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:48.280]   Like what is the brand?
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.280]   No.
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:53.480]   It's not Edge because we're going to change that too.
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.560]   We're going to make it Chrome.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:55.560]   It's Chrome, basically.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:56.560]   It's right.
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:58.560]   So Chrome ships with Windows now?
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:02:59.560]   No, no, no.
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:01.360]   You said the Chrome engine.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:04.560]   They're using the Chromium, we should say Chromium engine.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:06.560]   Chromium, like the other.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.360]   They're abandoning Edge's engine.
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:14.600]   And in fact, somebody on the Chrome on the Chrome, no, the Edge team said, come on Firefox.
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:20.600]   You join the crowd, stop trying to distribute a non-standard browser engine.
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:22.600]   One engine to rule them all.
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:25.080]   Which again, as you know, I'm not a fan of monocultures.
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:28.600]   That seems, Firefox, don't listen to them.
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:30.320]   It's all about engulfing devour.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:33.440]   These are the new Microsoft Office ads.
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:39.960]   We gave identical twins, identical tasks to see the difference between Office 2019 and
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:41.920]   Office 365.
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:45.640]   They'll just spreadsheet with data about all 50 states.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:48.080]   So they're both using surfaces.
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:51.880]   One had Excel data types thanks to Office 365.
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:52.880]   One did.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:53.880]   All right.
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:58.520]   They're literally telling you don't buy Office 2019.
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:03:59.520]   They still sell it.
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:02.720]   And people will have to have a box office.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:03.720]   All right, all done.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:04.720]   What?
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:05.720]   You did all 50?
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:06.720]   There's a few time lapse.
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:07.720]   Alabama.
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:15.440]   I don't know.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:16.440]   Is this compelling?
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.920]   Does it make you want to run out?
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:19.920]   Buy Office.
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:24.240]   I think they want people to subscribe instead of buying the package.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:25.880]   So don't use Edge.
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:26.920]   Don't use Internet Explorer.
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:30.240]   And please, don't buy Office.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.880]   Don't buy Office 2019.
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:32.880]   Right.
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:33.880]   And it's February.
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:34.880]   It's February.
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:35.880]   It's not that it's all.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:37.080]   It's that it's in a box.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:39.080]   Yeah, get them back.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:40.080]   Get them back.
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:44.720]   When Microsoft has a get a Mac ad.
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:46.680]   I could bring back the people.
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:48.760]   It feels like they're headed that way.
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:49.760]   Yeah.
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:50.760]   That's right.
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:55.920]   Although, hey, right props to a company that has learned how to get back to being a platform
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:00.320]   company and doesn't care as much about selling the windows in the desktop.
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:05.440]   Like if the software is available on whatever your phone is, like, that's progress.
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:07.360]   One of the first things that Nadella has brought progress.
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:14.080]   One of the first things Nadella did is make a touch first office not for windows but
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:15.080]   for iPad.
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:16.080]   Yeah.
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.880]   That was the first appearance of a touch first office.
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:22.080]   And people thought, you know, hell's frozen over.
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.080]   But it's worked.
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:24.440]   I mean, I guess it's worked.
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:26.400]   He's tripled the stock price in five years.
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:27.800]   That's pretty good.
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:32.080]   Whenever they bought GitHub, people weren't, you know, screaming and saying, I think that's
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:33.080]   over, right?
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:36.040]   And developers, you guys still, GitHub's fine, right?
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:37.600]   Even if Microsoft owns it.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:38.600]   It's fine.
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:39.600]   I forgot about it.
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:40.600]   I was like, oh, yeah, they did that.
[02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:41.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.600]   I actually forgot.
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:43.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:44.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:45.600]   It doesn't say Microsoft GitHub all over it or anything like that.
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:46.600]   No, it does not.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:47.920]   They did the same thing with LinkedIn.
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:49.800]   I think they've been pretty smart about their acquisitions.
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:54.600]   I could do without the hearts in Skype.
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:06:00.080]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.600]   So we've so much better.
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:05.680]   I know why does it just goes blue instead of showing the emoji.
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:09.920]   The chat shows the emoji, but we don't see the chat area.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:14.880]   So we've been, I've been, I've been yelling and screaming about two things for rise in
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:21.640]   pretending they like first responders and AT&T saying they have 5G E. There's actually
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:30.800]   people who think 5GE is better than 5G when in fact it's LTE 4G.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:33.000]   What is suing?
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:40.280]   Sprint is going after AT&T saying this damages our legitimate 5G rollout.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.680]   They might have a point there.
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:47.880]   I think it was very cynical of AT&T even though everybody said, yeah, we know it's not 5G,
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:53.680]   but we're going to, if you fact, if you get the new iOS 12.1.4 or is it 12.2?
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:54.680]   It might be 12.2.
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:07:00.680]   You'll see 5GE on your phone even though there literally is no such thing.
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:03.200]   It makes you feel like it's faster.
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:04.200]   It seems so much faster.
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:06.400]   It's like the placebo effect for your network.
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:12.520]   Well, and this is, they did this with, when the Berth-Velti...
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:14.520]   Oh yeah, HSPA 4G.
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:15.520]   It became a 4G.
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:17.080]   It was really rolled out.
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:18.080]   Yeah.
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:19.080]   Right, right, right.
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:23.840]   In a bunch of blog posts, I refer to it as FOGI, F-A-U-X-G.
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:26.680]   And that's exactly what they're doing, the exact same thing.
[02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:27.680]   They're just true to form.
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:30.120]   Well, we're going to be on 8G by Halloween.
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.120]   It's...
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:38.160]   18T's response, we understand why our competitors don't like what we're doing, but our customers
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:39.160]   love it.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:40.160]   See?
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:41.160]   It's a love-A-G.
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:42.160]   It's a love-A-G.
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:43.160]   It's a love-A-G.
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.160]   It's so fast.
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:47.040]   We introduced 5G Evolution more than two years ago.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:49.720]   Well, that should tell you something.
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:54.080]   Clearly defining it as an evolutionary step to a standard-based 5G.
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:59.520]   5G Evolution of 5GE indicator simply let customers know when their device is in an
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:03.000]   area where speeds up to twice as fast are available.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:08.320]   You're not going to get it, but that's what 5G Evolution is, and we're delighted, delighted
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:09.960]   to deliver it to our customers.
[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:13.040]   We will fight this lawsuit while continuing to deploy 5GE.
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:16.840]   In addition to the standards-based mobile 5G customers want and deserve to know when
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:19.600]   they're getting better speeds, but they're not.
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:23.180]   Sprint will have to reconcile its arguments to the FCC that they cannot deploy if rides
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:28.640]   spread 5G network without T-Mobile while simultaneously claiming in this suit to be launching legitimate
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:30.440]   5G technology immediately.
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:35.240]   It would be a shame if your merger would be to damage another one.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.840]   Another one.
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:37.840]   Oh, Lord.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:39.680]   Oh, we just hit 16G.
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:40.680]   I just saw that.
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:41.680]   Oh, thank you.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.680]   They just doubled.
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:43.680]   Thank you, AT&T.
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:45.520]   Neither are they good.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:48.160]   They are so good.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:53.160]   So when real 5G comes and they take the E off, it'll seem like less.
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.160]   It's less.
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:56.040]   I don't have my E.
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:57.040]   Where'd the E go?
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.560]   They're going to need 5G plus.
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:00.560]   G plus.
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:02.560]   That won't have any negative associations.
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:04.600]   5G, A, actual.
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:09.080]   I know your hip, Gina, but you go if I G actual.
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:10.080]   Actual.
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:11.080]   5G, really.
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:12.080]   5G for real.
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:13.080]   For real.
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:14.080]   For real.
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:16.680]   I like it.
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:17.680]   Pure 5G.
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:20.400]   5G, Z, turbo.
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:23.520]   Did you go watch Marshmallow perform in Fortnite?
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:26.560]   10 million people did.
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.720]   I love that you think that hip's still Leo.
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:30.720]   Come on.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:33.040]   I know you danced the night away.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:36.520]   I don't even know what any of those words mean.
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:37.520]   Oh, well.
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:38.520]   No, I've heard of Fortnite.
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:39.520]   Ask your daughter.
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:40.520]   She'll know.
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:41.520]   Yes.
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:42.520]   Soon, she'll know.
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:46.120]   Soon, she'll be saying, "Mommy, I want to dance with Marshmallow."
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:49.000]   So I'm just preparing you for your future.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.400]   It's good to know.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:52.400]   It's good to know.
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:59.640]   It was pretty massive, the largest streaming audience ever in Fortnite.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:04.280]   And it really points to me the fact that Fortnite has an opportunity here to become almost
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:07.080]   the next Facebook, the next social site for young youngers.
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:09.560]   An opportunity to become the next second life.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:11.400]   It's exactly like second life.
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:13.200]   Second life with guns.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.720]   Second life with guns.
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:16.640]   What could be wrong with that?
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:19.080]   Oh, I look forward to my future.
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:23.960]   If you've wondered where your old iPhone is going, well, Tokyo says it's going into our
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:26.520]   2020 Olympic medals.
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:32.880]   They want to make the medals entirely from recycled gold, silver, and bronze from recycled
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:35.320]   smartphones and other electronic devices.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:37.360]   E-waste.
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.720]   How many phones would it take to make one medal?
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:41.960]   I'm guessing a lot.
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:42.960]   Five million.
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:43.960]   Wow.
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:44.960]   Five million.
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:46.440]   That's a lot of phones.
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:48.560]   But there's a lot of old phones lying around.
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:53.920]   They need, okay, so they've already started.
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:11:01.520]   They collected five million disused phones at NTT Dokomo stores, post offices, other public
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:02.520]   buildings.
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:06.960]   Last June, they already got 2,700 kilograms of bronze.
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:15.200]   They're 93% of the weight of their 30 kilograms of gold and 85% to their 41 kilograms of silver.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.200]   Pretty cool.
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:17.200]   I love this.
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:18.200]   Yeah.
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:19.520]   I love this to be outreached about.
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:20.520]   I love this.
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:22.320]   No, there's nothing wrong with this.
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:23.320]   It's great.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.320]   It's exactly.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.960]   Well, people forget that there's actually precious medals in these electronics.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:28.920]   All of our electrons have gold in them.
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:29.920]   Yeah.
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:32.160]   Although I wonder what the process is to extract it.
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:34.560]   Like can we complain about the energy it would take to extract it?
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:36.200]   I'm sure it's more expensive.
[02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:38.560]   And the chemicals used to extract it.
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.560]   Right.
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:40.560]   Yeah.
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:41.560]   And the small Chinese children used to extract it.
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.560]   The trunks.
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:43.560]   No, they're not.
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:44.560]   No, they're not.
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:45.560]   They're not doing that.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:49.840]   Didn't Apple display a robot that took apart?
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:50.840]   Yes.
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:51.840]   It's iPhone.
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:52.840]   Liam.
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:53.840]   And so Liam, right.
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:54.840]   Right.
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.600]   So maybe they don't need small Chinese children.
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:58.320]   Well there's only one Liam.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:11:59.320]   That's the problem.
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:02.480]   There's a new one called Daisy.
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:03.480]   Yeah.
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:04.480]   Oh, Daisy.
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:06.680]   Daisy can take apart.
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:07.680]   Oh my God.
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:09.440]   200 iPhones an hour.
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:10.440]   Wow.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:11.440]   Wow.
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:12.440]   Wow.
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:14.840]   That's 200 iPhones an hour.
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:15.840]   That's what?
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.840]   24, 100 iPhones a day.
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:24.440]   That's a whopping, I don't know, I have to do the math, but something like what?
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:25.920]   10,000 iPhones a year.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:28.920]   I think there's a few more than that lying around.
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:30.480]   How many daisies are they?
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:31.480]   Are there?
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:32.480]   That's the question.
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:33.480]   That's going to take a while to make the metals.
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:35.440]   That's going to say it does Daisy scale.
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:36.440]   Does Daisy scale?
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:37.440]   Well, you know what?
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:40.280]   You just put them back together and you can Daisy chain them.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:41.280]   Oh!
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:42.280]   Oh, that's no.
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:43.280]   I'm here all week.
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:44.280]   I'm here all week.
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:45.280]   You are.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:46.280]   It hurts.
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:47.280]   It hurts.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.560]   Colonel Cuts, give us your plug for the United States Digital Service.
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:54.120]   All right, my plug is this.
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:59.040]   Every time I come out to San Francisco, I see people doing meal kit delivery software.
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:01.720]   I see people doing cryptocurrencies.
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:08.160]   And I can tell you, you can come to DC and make a huge impact to help out farmers, doctors,
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:13.920]   patients, students, veterans, military service member, people who need social security.
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.280]   You can make those services work better for people who need them.
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:21.440]   And there are millions of people that need assistance.
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:25.600]   We just rolled out something last week where if you're an asylum seeker, there's 300,000
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:26.920]   people in the backlog.
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:32.840]   If you wanted to know where you were in that backlog, you had to go in person or fax or
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:34.840]   email somebody.
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:39.680]   And now you can go to a website and you can type in your receipt number and you can get
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:41.760]   back the status of your case online.
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:46.120]   So this is not necessarily rocket science, but it really helps people who want to make
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:49.120]   it, who want to have a good interaction with the US government.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:51.200]   And what kind of skill sets are you looking for?
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:52.200]   That's a great question.
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:53.360]   We need engineers.
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:54.840]   We need product managers.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:55.840]   We need designers.
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:59.920]   And we even need like, we're looking for technical recruiters and could use a lawyer or two.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:05.600]   It turns out how things work in the law really matters for making things work well.
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:09.080]   I think nowadays so much distrust in government.
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:14.640]   And it's a chance for you to participate in a way that makes a big difference.
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:18.600]   What has been remarkable to me is the number of people who said, I'm going to come for
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:23.200]   six months and then I'm going to go back to the Facebooks, the Amazon, the Twitters, the
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:24.200]   apples.
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:28.680]   And they either stay or they will take a left turn and they're like doing a startup in
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:31.640]   the civic tech space or they're helping at the state level.
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:34.800]   Because it's satisfying reading code that makes a difference, I'm sure.
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:35.800]   It really is.
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:41.200]   It is the hardest, most meaningful job that I have ever done.
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:44.720]   Will if you're working for a big tech company, will some tech companies allow you to leave
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:46.240]   the absence to do this and come back?
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:47.240]   Absolutely.
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.040]   In fact, Microsoft is one of the leaders, one of the person, the CIO of Microsoft.
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.600]   His name is Kurt Del Benet.
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:53.240]   He's the CIO of Microsoft.
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:54.960]   He helped with healthcare.gov.
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:57.600]   So he came back, he put a civic leave program in place.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:01.880]   If you're a Microsoft person, if you're a Google person, a lot of these companies have
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:03.200]   civic leave programs.
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:07.040]   If you're still working on an Internet Explorer at Microsoft, you might want to think about
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:08.040]   this.
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:10.000]   You have come home, save some people's lives.
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.600]   We made the help.
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:16.320]   U S digital service USDS dot gov slash join.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:19.360]   And I think this is so always such a pleasure to see you.
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:22.840]   He's doing such good work and you're so cute in that crap costume.
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:24.360]   Thank you for being here.
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:27.840]   Gina, Trippani, I can't tell you how much we miss you on Twitter.
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:30.600]   Every week on Twig, we say, where's Gina?
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:31.600]   Where is Gina?
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:33.160]   I'll tell you where she is.
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:37.040]   She's managing partner post light.com.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.320]   Check them out if you need programming for an app or a website.
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:44.840]   If you need some custom code, imagine having the best do it.
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:46.840]   Design develop ship post light.com.
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:47.840]   Gina.
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:48.840]   Get in touch.
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.400]   Thank you for having me.
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:51.400]   This was so much fun.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:54.240]   I'm so glad I got to join you, Leo and Matt and Dwight.
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:55.240]   This is a lot of fun.
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:56.240]   We're going to do this more often.
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:57.240]   It's been too long.
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:15:58.240]   Careful if you say that.
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:01.560]   You're going to break my heart if you don't because I want you to back anytime you want.
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:05.800]   Anytime, you could just call me and say, "I want to be on," and you'd be on like that.
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:06.800]   All right.
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:07.800]   All of you.
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:08.800]   You're on.
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:09.800]   You're on.
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:10.800]   Same goes for Dwight Silverman.
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:16.080]   I feel so fortunate to be able to work with so many great people for so many years.
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:18.280]   Dwight, you're one of them.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:19.520]   I really appreciate you being here.
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:23.400]   I was looking up on, I think there's a twit wiki out there.
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:25.880]   I was looking up when I first was on.
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:30.960]   I don't remember now when it was, but I was astonished as to how long I'd been doing
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:31.960]   this.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:35.840]   Now I've been doing this enough that I'm one of the most frequent guests that you've had
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:36.840]   over the years.
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:40.880]   I feel like I'm part of the family and I love doing it.
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:43.120]   You all should come back every week.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.160]   We really appreciate your being here.
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:48.680]   We certainly say the same for you, our fabulous audience.
[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:49.680]   You could be in the studio.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:51.320]   We had a great studio audience today.
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:55.800]   Tim and Paula visiting from Traverse City, Michigan and Evan from San Jose and Brian from
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:57.200]   San Francisco.
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:58.920]   You've all visiting from Palo Alto.
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:00.240]   He's just relocated there.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:01.760]   It's great to have you in studio.
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:03.600]   All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:06.640]   We'll make a chair out, put a chair out there for you.
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:09.000]   We'd love to have you if you're up in the Petaluma area.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.160]   Of course, you can also watch live at our stream.
[02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:15.040]   That's twit.tv/liveaudio or you can listen live.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:17.640]   Audio or video, twit.tv/live.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:22.960]   If you are participating live, definitely go into the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:29.440]   That's where all the other kids who are participating live hang out, making fun of Colonel
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:30.440]   Krabby Cuts.
[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:33.320]   It's a good chat channel.
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:34.920]   It's a great chat channel.
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:36.880]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:39.800]   Of course, we do make all our shows available on demand.
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:45.240]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv or website or fire up Spotify or Stitcher or Slacker
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:49.360]   or Pocketcaster iTunes or Google podcast or any podcast app.
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:54.480]   You can even ask your voice assistant, "Hey Echo, listen to this week in tech."
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:56.400]   It'll play the most recent version.
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:00.000]   Subscribe and you'll get every version the minute it's available.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000]   That's nice.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.520]   Every show the minute it's available.
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:03.520]   Thank you for being here.
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:04.520]   We'll see you next time.
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:05.520]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:06.520]   Bye.
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:06.520]   [music]
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:15.840]   [music]
