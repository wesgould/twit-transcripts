[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.280]   And as a result, Dogecoin takes a tumble.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.560]   The Facebook oversight board punts on the Trump decision right into Mark Zuckerberg's
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.320]   schnaz and its Google versus Roku in a fight to the finish.

[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.200]   It's time for TWIT this week at Tech, the show we cover the latest tech news.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.680]   We have a fine panel.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.160]   Actually there's an addition to the panel, which I'll show you in just a bit.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.880]   But first let me say hello to Alex Wilhelm.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.880]   So Tech Crunch is owned by...
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.720]   What's happened?
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.320]   So I think it's most fair to say we're currently in between parents if you know, parent companies.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   So somewhere between...
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.360]   How was after mom and dad broke up I remember, yeah.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   Yes, so Leo you can think of me as in between a phone company and a private equity firm,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.440]   I suppose.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.960]   Verizon and then whoever the private equity firm is.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.840]   I think Apollo, Apollo Creed, ventures, something like that?
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   Apollo something or other.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.760]   Essentially a large amount of money that grew legs and runs around picking things up and
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760]   saying mine.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.760]   Mine.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.760]   And they not...
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.760]   Don't like the hand that feeds you.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   These giants are sensitive.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760]   Watch me.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.000]   Anyways, they got my parent companies, parent companies, parent companies.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And now I think I'm going to...
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I don't know, maybe lose 401k matching.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We'll see.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   We'll see.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.240]   Yeah, it doesn't affect you.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.560]   You're just an inked stained wretch.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.800]   Speaking of changes, Owen Thomas is here.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.240]   Last we spoke, he was at the Chronicle.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.920]   You've moved over a senior editor now at Protocol.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.920]   Hi, Owen.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920]   Good to see you.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920]   Hello.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.120]   Yeah, it's great to have you.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.480]   I think the last time I saw you in person, it was with Alex Wilhelm.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.120]   So you guys are old friends, I think, yes.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120]   We can't wait for that.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.920]   Owen has recently moved to Protocol.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.300]   We'll ask him about that in a bit.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.920]   But I also wanted to do so special guest.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.400]   Christian Warren.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   Yes.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.040]   Stina Warren has brought her nephew on.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   Yes.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   From a mother's day.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   Yes.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.320]   Happy, happy Mother's Day and happy a break for my sister.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.280]   This is TV freakin' nice stuff.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.040]   Oh, yeah, we still use your own name.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   Yes, I love that.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   In my own A name.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.040]   Yes.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   This is Christian.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.720]   He is eight days old and he is, we're just chillin'.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   And I'm in Atlanta.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.560]   I'm with the family for the first time in 18 months and it's great to see everybody.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.320]   And he's wonderful.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.080]   So I think this is our youngest guest ever, right?
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.320]   I don't think we've ever had a baby on the show.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.160]   My knowledge, no.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   This'll be the first.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160]   Amazing.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.880]   Well, we may have had small children.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.840]   We never had an eight day old.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   That's pretty darn young.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.320]   I don't think you'd have to work really hard to get somebody younger than that.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   I think so.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   I think so.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   Happy Mother's Day to all the moms.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.760]   You're actively doing that right now for your sister, which is one.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   Yes.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   Yes.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   Really.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.560]   Well, it's going to have all of you.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.200]   Did you watch Elon Musk last night on Saturday Night Live?
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   No.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.160]   No, I did not.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.920]   Apparently, there were Dogecoin watch parties.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.560]   Oh, so they just watched us as the Doge disappeared?
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.560]   That's fine.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.680]   Well, I think they thought Elon would say all sorts of nice things about Dogecoin because
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.280]   he's has in the past.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.080]   In fact, I think you can credit Elon Musk with bringing Dogecoin up to what was it?
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080]   How much do you have?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.080]   How much do you have?
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:51.380]   My meme investment is, oh, I have like 4,700 Doge.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.520]   So, and my cost average is like, at this point, it's 24 cents.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.920]   I originally got in at like nine or 10 cents.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:08.400]   So I'm up like $1,600 even with the fall, but I would have been up more if the SNL thing
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   hadn't been cut before.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.800]   My daughter on Friday texted me.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.680]   Literally, I should read the text.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.440]   Hey, dad, how do I buy Doge on Android on Friday, to which I said, now is not the time
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   to buy it.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   It's at an all time high.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   Little did I know.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   Yes.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.840]   Somebody was saying they made $15 just during Saturday Night Live alone.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.080]   So he came on, he hosted Saturday Night Live.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.520]   The bits I saw I could barely watch was paying terrible.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.920]   During it, he says Doge is a hustle right before the show began.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.480]   Dogecoin hit 70 cents.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.760]   It slumped to 47 cents when the show started, did recover by 2 AM Eastern right after the
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.840]   show to 55 cents.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.600]   When Robin Hood actually was overwhelmed by crypto traders, they tweeted at 9.22 PM Pacific
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.120]   time, which is right in the middle of Saturday Night Live.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.400]   We're currently experiencing issues with crypto trading.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.720]   We're working to resolve this as soon as possible.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.920]   It's crowdhog day.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   Apparently.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.200]   Yeah, I was going to say, this happens every time there's a big rush on some sort of crypto.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.760]   Suddenly, Robin Hood just goes down.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.920]   I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.360]   I don't think they're doing it on purpose.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.760]   But it definitely is one of those things that you're going to roll your eyes a little
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.760]   bit.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.760]   I'll just give you a little.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.360]   I dumbly bought my Doge from them, but it's also like if it goes to zero, I don't care.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.840]   It's an easy way to buy it.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.160]   If I didn't want to keep my daughter from losing her pants, I would have told her get
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.240]   Robin Hood, but I wasn't going to tell her that.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   Absolutely.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.280]   I actually had a family member ask me the same question, like how do I buy Doge?
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.720]   Because they started out asking me, how do I sign up for Robin Hood?
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.480]   And I said, well, so I would you do that.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.760]   And I was starting to talk about the payment for order flip problems.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.520]   And then it turned into Doge.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.000]   And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.760]   Because you can't actually buy cryptocurrency on Robin Hood.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.440]   Oh, what are you buying?
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.960]   You can give Robin Hood money and they'll put an entry in your account that says that
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.560]   you have however many Doge coin.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.000]   But you can't transfer it out and you can't transfer cryptocurrency you own in.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.680]   And there's no regulation right now of this activity.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.520]   So should you go to somewhere like Coinbase instead?
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.920]   Yeah, the problem is with Doge.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.880]   Well, Coinbase doesn't do it.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.880]   Doesn't do Doge.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.800]   Which really makes me wonder.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.840]   Oh, and let's let's be serious about this.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.640]   Like no one in the consumer world really wants to own a cryptocurrency.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.720]   What they want is exposure to price appreciation of the cryptocurrency.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.280]   And they can do that with Robin Hood or cash app via a square PayPal, whatever.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.440]   And so I've been getting tweets about this all week.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.280]   People telling me that crypto volume on other provider X is not real because you don't
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.040]   own it, not your keys, not your coins.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   People don't care.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.320]   The mass market just wants to make money.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.360]   And so this argument that you shouldn't buy stuff on Robin Hood to me is specious.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.920]   They just want the appreciation.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   You can't transfer it in.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.720]   You can't transfer it out and it randomly crashes.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.240]   So how do you own it?
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.920]   If you randomly can't access it.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.440]   The only concern I would have is if I buy it on Robin Hood and they didn't really make
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.040]   that transaction and Doge coin goes through the roof, can I reasonably expect to get that
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.040]   appreciation and somehow capitalize on it?
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.920]   Can I do anything with it after that?
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:53.440]   No, the great news is that the Biden administration actually appointed one of the world's most sophisticated
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.720]   experts on cryptocurrencies, Gary Gensler, to be chair of the SEC.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.360]   And he testified this week before Congress about all these problems.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.040]   And what I think we're going to see is that the SEC is going to start regulating exchanges.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   They're not going to be regulating cryptocurrency like a stock, like really tightly.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:19.680]   But I think the Robin Hood example is a great case of why you need some regulation.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.040]   Like Robin Hood should be required to have some kind of uptime requirement.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.320]   They should be required to let you transfer cryptocurrency in and out.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.800]   And they should be required to make you good if you try to sell it and their systems crash
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.160]   and you can't sell it and their price drops.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.040]   Yeah, no, I totally agree with that.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.240]   I think I do partially agree with Alex.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.280]   I think that some people, especially for coins like Doge, where you don't really care
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.040]   so much if you're owning it on the blockchain, right?
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.920]   It's one of those things, okay, fine.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.280]   You're day trading it.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.280]   It's a gamble.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.280]   It is pure gambling.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   I put money into it.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.280]   It is pure gambling.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.920]   It disappears all of it tomorrow.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   Fine.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.280]   But for something like, say, Ethereum or more notably Bitcoin, where there are limits, right,
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.840]   where it's not actually a meme coin and people have given it some sort of value, I wouldn't
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.160]   recommend that people buy it on Robin Hood if they are wanting to look at it as some sort
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.280]   of long-term investment and not something to just have and kind of like a money market
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.480]   account.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.480]   Because as to Owen's point, you don't own it.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.560]   They own the coin.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.920]   You own whatever value it is at that moment.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.720]   And because there's not the regulation and they don't have the uptime requirements like
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.280]   other exchanges, if-- and I don't think Robin Hood is going to go under, but if some of
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.160]   these services did, if something happened, they would probably be like, okay, well, we
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.560]   only owe you this amount, but we don't actually owe you the coin itself because it doesn't
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   belong to you.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.120]   Because we never really bought it in the first place.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.120]   Exactly.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.320]   Because you're just buying the value of it in.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.160]   That said, there are some real advantages of using Robin Hood or PayPal or Cash App or
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.760]   whatever, one of them being the transaction times in those fees because you can really
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.240]   quickly and make money spaglatively if that's what you want to do without having to--
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:09.560]   you wait the time and pay the fee that you would have to pay with a normal exchange.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.240]   I looked into buying Doge.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.880]   This was in January.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.280]   I looked at buying Doge an actual exchange and I realized there weren't any people,
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.280]   well, ones actually wanted to give my information to.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.400]   So I was like, all right, fine.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.080]   I'll open a Robin Hood account.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.040]   By the time it was approved, the meme had died or so I thought, and I forgot about the
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.120]   account.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.840]   Then three weeks ago, a half weeks ago, I started seeing the Doge was going up again
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:40.520]   and I put money into it and sadly, well, fortunately for me, but also hilariously,
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.320]   if it all goes the opposite direction, it's funny either way.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.400]   I've now tripled my money.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.840]   So there you go.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:58.080]   I feel like this is-- to say it's a meme coin is to really inflate the value of Ethereum
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:04.880]   or Bitcoin beyond-- I mean, it's all the same stuff.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.240]   It's crypto.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.480]   Let me play these.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:16.280]   I just feel like, I don't know, between NFTs, Doge going through the roof, Game Stocks,
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.480]   Game Spot's the hot go on through the roof, which is the last time you were on Alex, by
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   the way.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.280]   I feel like we live in not the best time.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.720]   I worry we're in the Weimar Republic right before the Nazis took power is what I worry
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   about.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.360]   Let me play this clip from Saturday Night Live.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.600]   The only one I'll play.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.040]   This is Elon Musk, who said, by the way, in his opening that he was the first Asperger's
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.800]   host of Saturday Night Live, which actually is not even true, whether he's Asperger's
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   or not.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   I don't know.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.200]   Here he is playing a financial analyst named Lloyd Ostertag.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.640]   They're a type of digital money, but instead of being controlled by a central government,
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.800]   they're decentralized using blockchain technology.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.200]   All right, I've had enough.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.080]   I can't watch anymore.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.800]   It's just so awful.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   It's just so awful.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.240]   You know what would be great, Leo, is if we had comedians go on SNL because whenever
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.680]   they have a comedian on the show is funny, whenever they bring someone on, he's not a
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.680]   comedian.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.680]   He's not funny.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.320]   It's all painful to watch him try to read cue cards.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.320]   Cue cards.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.320]   It's really bad.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.320]   It's really painful.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   It's not good.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   I was going to play it until the point where he said that Dogecoin was just a hustle, but
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   I think you got the point.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.160]   I don't think we need to play anymore of this.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.840]   I wonder if I can buy some game spot stock right now and just go full circle.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   Yes, Elmo.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   Yes.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.800]   Here's my thought about your point about if you call a Dogecoin a meme, what is that?
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   That's a different.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.280]   It's all the same, isn't it?
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.080]   Here's my perspective on this.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.280]   I wrote about this a little bit this week on my personal blog.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.400]   That way I wouldn't get TC in trouble if people made fun of me.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.280]   To me, Ethereum as a crypto seems to be building a foundational layer.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.400]   Other people are building stuff.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.440]   The whole NFT hype thing is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.760]   We can all quibble about NFTs and how material they are, how long they last, whatever.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.440]   It just goes to show that you can build stuff that consumers actually want to buy or use
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.800]   or invest in on top of Ethereum and the Ethercoin.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   Cool.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.800]   That's fine with me.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:25.520]   Arguments that Doge is just a meme, but Bitcoin is super solid, is species to me.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.120]   You say in the subhead, if Doge is dumb, then Bitcoin is dumb.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.560]   That's my personal blog on Twitch.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.600]   I didn't mean to try to endorse myself there.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.880]   But yeah, so people were some Bitcoin maximalists that I follow on Twitter were talking about
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.280]   how guys be careful with Doge put your money in Bitcoin and I was like, well, that's quite
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.280]   a statement.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.000]   I'm trying to write about why I think it's a little bit silly.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.640]   I think the hard cap arguments a little bit weak, etc, etc, etc.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.080]   But I mean, at least Ethereum's platform now, people are building companies on top of it.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   Okay.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   I'll just play it a little bit.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.320]   So you're saying there's some technology involved in Ethereum that makes it of more value,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.280]   let's say, than Doge or Bitcoin.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.520]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.960]   Because it's not just a quote, quote, store of value, which is essentially just, you know,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.600]   people buying it because they think other people are going to buy it.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   Right.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.120]   So to me, Ethereum has functionality and it is use.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   It's not just...
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:26.640]   Is there any concern, Owen, that this is just like tulip bulbs that we've got that we're
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.400]   in just kind of a friends, a financial frenzy that there's a lot of greed at some point
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.560]   the bubble is going to burst and we're all going to deeply regret what has happened?
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.120]   I think if you look at the like total market value of these cryptocurrencies, it's not
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.960]   at a point where I'd really worry about like lasting damage to the world financial...
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.400]   But some people aren't going to get hurt.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   I mean, clearly.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.600]   Like if my daughter had bought Dogecoin, she doesn't have a lot of money that wouldn't
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   live in...
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.440]   I think a top UK regulator said, said over the past week, like if you invest in cryptocurrency,
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.520]   you should fully expect it to go to zero.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.640]   Like you should be prepared for it to go to zero.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.240]   And same thing with NFTs, right?
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.160]   Yeah, I mean, NFTs are different because they're not...
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.640]   Each NFT is kind of bespoke.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.920]   It's kind of its own thing.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:25.320]   And so it's sure any NFT could go to zero, but with NFTs, I think the analogy would be
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.640]   like a pizza fine art.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Or a baseball card.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.640]   You're buying something.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.160]   It's highly speculative.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.680]   You have no notion of whether it's going to go up or down, but you know that's immaably
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.680]   right?
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.680]   It's illiquid.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.800]   Like you don't know that there will be a buyer, let alone multiple buyers.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.760]   But people buy cryptocurrency as if they're buying stocks.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.600]   It's an investment.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.360]   I think that's the hardest thing about cryptocurrency.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.520]   Like, is it a new technology?
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.800]   Is it a store of value?
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:59.000]   Is it a price appreciation mechanism?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.920]   I think people buy cryptocurrency for different reasons.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.320]   I mean, you have to remember, over the course of various financial crises over the past
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:16.840]   decade, there were countries that did not have stable currencies like the American dollar.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.880]   And they actually looked at Bitcoin mostly as like, well, this is something I can buy
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.680]   and I can avoid my country's hyperinflation or collapsing banks or what have you.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.120]   So there are actually real world examples where Bitcoin's been used as...
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   That's better.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:40.480]   There are even some national banks, including our own Federal Reserve, looking at stable
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.000]   coin as a possible offering, right?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   They're thinking about...
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.360]   Instead of just printing money, printing stable coin.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.440]   Stable coin kind of takes that idea of fiat currency, a currency that is just backed by
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.760]   a government which some people argue is no better than a meme coin.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:09.360]   But they're essentially getting the benefits of blockchain technology and just all the
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.480]   mechanisms by which you can trade cryptocurrency, but attaching it to a stable coin.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.760]   But I think stable coins, the problem with stable coin is they're not exciting.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.760]   Like Facebook's...
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.560]   There's no ups and downs.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.520]   Yeah, it's like, why would you want that?
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:34.440]   I think the prospect of making money is what draws a lot of people in.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:41.520]   I mean, that's 100% why we have family members texting us about like, how do I buy Dogecoin?
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.320]   I think we've actually reached the end times because the star of...
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:52.520]   The arch nemesis of the Tiger King, Carol Baskin is now announcing she's releasing her
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.680]   own crypto coin.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.280]   She calls it a "perancy."
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.040]   Oh my gosh.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:05.400]   If Carol Baskin is issuing a crypto coin, we're definitely at the end times.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.280]   Leo, your discussion of everything being kind of in a mania at the same time is applicable
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.880]   to several parts of the economy.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.080]   I mean, Owen and I spend a lot of time looking at the stock market and we've been kind of
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.960]   enduring the rise of SPACs.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:23.920]   And I think SPACs are a pretty good proxy for how speculative or risk on the traditional
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   capital markets are.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.200]   And the same way the NFTs and ISTOs at different times have been, I think kind of indicative
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.360]   of how speculative and risk on the crypto markets have been.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.160]   But everything seems to be pretty heated at once.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.080]   And I don't know how that's going to last.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.040]   I think the youngest person here is why the least financial historical lived knowledge.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.800]   But to me, probably doesn't end well when this stuff eventually unravels.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.920]   Certainly is entertaining and fun to watch in the meantime.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.200]   I just don't have any of my personal assets in digital currencies because of journalism
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   rules.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.840]   But I would probably play along this for fun if I could.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.800]   You know, in most Western economies, we've had low inflational long time, which means
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.480]   low interest rates.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.800]   And the response to pretty much any kind of financial hiccup has been to batten down
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.160]   those interest rates to as close to zero as possible.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:25.320]   And so we've been kind of starved of sensible vehicles for appreciating in value because
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   interest rates are so low.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.040]   You can't just put money in the bank.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:35.000]   So I think that has driven the appetite for risk to a point where it does become kind
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.960]   of crazy because people are looking at it and saying, well, I don't feel like I can make
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.840]   really exciting gains in my forum.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.880]   Okay, the stock market has been doing more than okay.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:52.120]   But you know, that's like putting their money in a ETF, slow and steady dollar cost averaging.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   That's boring.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.840]   So you kind of have people, you know, like lacking entertainment, right?
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.800]   Because of the pandemic, they can't go watch sports.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.840]   They can't go hang on to the bar and super low interest rates.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.160]   And it just, you know, I think that creates this mania.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.440]   So let's go side to individuals.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.720]   So if some people will lose their shirts, is there a risk though to the financial stability
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.440]   of this country?
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.960]   Is there a risk to the markets, to the global economy?
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:30.640]   Is all of this investment in these kind of high flying vehicles dangerous beyond just
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.520]   the risk to individual investors?
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.000]   Hmm.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.320]   We're starting to have a little exposure to the crypto economy in Coinbase, in Square.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.320]   Right.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   Right.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.080]   But I think as, you know, if you look at those holdings as a percentage of the total market
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.560]   cap of the stock market, you know, if something bad happened to those companies because of
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.880]   the crypto market, I think we'd still be okay.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:05.440]   I think the exposure of mainstream financial institutions to cryptocurrencies is minimal.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.320]   The Goldman Sachs is starting up a crypto trading desk.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.080]   So that means they're going to have some crypto related risk.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.120]   Well, you remember what happened the last time the banks decided that they wanted to
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.600]   be players.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.800]   We had the crash of 2008.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   There is that potential.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.520]   But you're saying they're being a little wiser this time and they're not, and they're
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   not.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.440]   I just don't see a lot of, yeah.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.400]   I just don't see a lot of exposure right now.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.080]   But you know, then again, the thing you worry about is when they start building derivatives
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.160]   off the stuff because that like leverages.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.600]   So you get little swings making, making these giant swings and that's when you start seeing
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:53.520]   like Bank of America reporting, you know, cryptocurrency derivative profits run for the
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.520]   hills.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.360]   Hi, Joe Hart, girl.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.640]   Leo, can I try the spec to the tech world that we talk about?
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.160]   Because I think probably some people are like, oh my God, they're talking about finance.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.480]   Yeah, this is not a finance show.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.960]   I have two finance guys on.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.880]   And of course, Christine is an expert on the speculative sneaker market.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.360]   So I think really the three of you really are all up on this stuff.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.880]   And I am not.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:21.040]   But I do think it's taken away because well, first it is, it is kind of what it really
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:27.400]   is, is the impact of technologists on everything.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.440]   And in this case, on the financial markets, right?
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   For sure.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.240]   But also keep in mind that all this cheap money is in many cases flowing into young tech
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   companies.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.240]   Right.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.120]   So one aspect of the stuff that Owen was talking about a little bit ago is that venture capital
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.440]   investment around the world is that an all time high.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.560]   And what that means is more money is being pumped into software companies.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.560]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.800]   And it's probably ever before.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.880]   So if you care about the technology world, which is as beyond the kind of grounded in
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.120]   software, well, this stuff actually does impact your life.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.560]   You don't have to care about it too much.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.840]   You don't have to track all the stuff they had today that we do.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.280]   But I mean, it is part of your world, whether you care or not.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   So we're not being too obtuse.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.840]   No, and it's part of your world because you just got by a big private equity company.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   It hasn't closed yet, Leo.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.160]   It hasn't closed yet.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.320]   I still technically work for Verizon.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.520]   So I expect my employee just gone to persist.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.320]   But it's funny because Verizon probably was a high tech, you know, thought of as a high
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.120]   tech company 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:34.200]   Now it's an old media company selling off its assets to the latest thing, which is these
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.040]   private equities.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.600]   These private equity companies are really following chasing the same thing, aren't they?
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.440]   Oh, and they're trying to chase growth in an era of low interest rates.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.960]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   And they are also--
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.760]   And they're taking big risks as a result.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.240]   Yeah, no.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.240]   Trying to make Yahoo a thing.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.000]   I mean, that's been catching a falling knife for the past decade.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.240]   How many have caught that knife and regretted it?
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.480]   I mean, Merse Mayer looked like she was turning it around, and then she wasn't.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.160]   I will say to the exposure point, and this tells us how to back in to tech a little bit,
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.160]   you do about companies.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:25.520]   Like, I mean, Elon Musk Tesla, he said, has a significant holding in Bitcoin, right?
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.720]   And if you saw more companies following his lead, I do think that although we be small,
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   you know, at to Owens Point in terms of like the total financial thing, if we saw more
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:42.360]   tech companies saying we're going to put our holdings into, you know, cryptocurrency,
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.600]   that has a real world impact, right?
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.920]   Because if those companies go down, those are those jobs.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.720]   Those are, you know, the people who depend on those companies for contracts and other
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   things.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.880]   So I think that opens it up a little bit more too.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.880]   But yeah.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.880]   All right.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.360]   I don't want to become the financial podcast if I find this stuff confusing, but it does
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:09.280]   feel like it's it's fringing into our our consciousness, right?
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.600]   Leo, you're wearing a vest.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.880]   You look like a banker, my man.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.960]   You know, I feel like I dressed like a banker today.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.680]   I thought I should talk about the market.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:22.760]   You know, I we we do cover financial technology, a protocol.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.920]   Some people call it fintech.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.720]   I hate that word, but anyway, you know, the point I've made about financial technology
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:35.320]   is like going back 50 years or so, like the, you know, to the creation of Visa, no bank
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.880]   has been able to function without technology.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.800]   So I'm not sure I even see the separation, frankly, between the modern world of finance
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   and the.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.360]   But that's life.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.760]   That's what's happened universally in every aspect of life.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.760]   That's the difference.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.960]   Technology is now a big part of life.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.040]   It used to be the side show when I first started covering it 30 years ago.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.160]   It was a hobby for individuals.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.680]   Now it's everything we do and everywhere we go.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:10.520]   So in a way, what we cover now is broadened considerably to pretty much, you know, everything.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   I want to take a little break.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.520]   We will come back.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:18.360]   We have, you know, the traditional players, Amazon and Apple and Google and all of Facebook.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.400]   Actually, I want to talk about the Facebook oversight board when we come back.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.280]   See how technology is now verging on politics.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.360]   Okay.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.040]   You can't get away from it.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.600]   Our show today brought to you by a brand new sponsor.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   You guys will like this.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.800]   In fact, I bet you know all about it.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.320]   Our crowd know our crowd.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:44.120]   This is a very interesting company that will allow you, if you are a accredited investor,
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:48.440]   to get in on deals, you would not normally be able to touch.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.640]   If you are sitting back and looking at some of the best performing IPOs of last year
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.360]   in the year before and wondering, how can I get in?
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.360]   Our crowd.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.040]   Now you have to be an accredited investor and the rules for that will vary depending on
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.040]   which country.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.800]   You can easily find out if you go to our crowd.com and click the button that says, you know,
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.040]   what is an accredited investor.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.240]   It will tell you what the limits are and so forth in each country.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.680]   But if you are an accredited investor and you are looking to invest directly, easily
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.880]   and most importantly, early on some of the most exciting new offerings, you are going
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.560]   to want to know about our crowd.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.880]   Our crowd investors have benefited.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:32.280]   I can talk about past performance, which is no indication of future results, as they say.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:39.240]   But companies like Beyond Meat, which was a huge exit for our crowd investors, are companies
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.360]   that are being bought now by Intel and Nike and Microsoft and Oracle.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.320]   Our crowd is run by professional VCs.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.720]   They do the research that would normally do as any venture capitalist.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   But then you get to benefit by participating.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.600]   They're investing at the same time as you.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.720]   They're not selling you something.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.840]   This is a way of you getting in with professional VCs on something.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.600]   They've got a number of funds.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.800]   They identify promising companies and funds across a range of sectors, stages and global
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   locations.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.520]   There's medical technology.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   There's AgTech.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.440]   Where everybody agrees, AgTech is going to be one of the next big areas, food production.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.840]   The robotic industry, multi-billion dollar industry.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.960]   You do have, there's a minimum.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   I want to be very clear.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.520]   You have to be an accredited investor.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.000]   There's a minimum of $10,000 required to invest.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.280]   The terms will vary depending on the country you're coming from.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.120]   You might want to know about our crowd.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:41.600]   Investing in real companies, portfolio companies that are transforming the way we live, work
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   and play.

[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:09.040]   I think it's a very interesting way to participate in what is clearly a technological revolution.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.400]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   Our crowd.com/twit.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:17.280]   We thank you so much for supporting this week in tech.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.680]   Facebook's oversight board has punted, I would say.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.040]   This is a punt, I'm going to say.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:31.320]   They were asked to rule on the suspension of president, the former president from Facebook.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.040]   They are upholding the suspension.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:43.320]   However, they say only for six months, Facebook has to review the matter and they have to,
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.480]   they say that Facebook failed to impose the proper penalty.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:54.000]   It was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate, in other words, indefinite
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   and standardless penalty of indefinite suspension.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.600]   Facebook's normal penalties include removing the violating content, imposing a, hello,
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.480]   hello Christian, imposing it, he doesn't like it either.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.880]   A time-bound security suspension or permanently disabling the page and account, the board
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   insists, I'm reading from the board's decision, insists.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:20.960]   I don't think many people come to Mark Zuckerberg and say, I insist you review this matter to
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:26.160]   determine and justify a proportionate response and you must do that within six months.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:32.360]   So in other words, okay, okay, you can do it, but not from another, if you're going to
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:39.040]   keep it doing it after six months, you better explain yourself.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.320]   Christina, what do you think?
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   Is this punting?
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   Is this the right decision?
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.040]   This is complete punting, no, I totally agree with you.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.800]   In fact, I was sort of excited that I wasn't going to have to pay attention to this because
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.840]   I had flown in and I was like, I get to meet the baby, I don't have to deal with it, but
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.760]   of course, I know myself and I'm like, no, of course, I'm going to pay attention to this.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.080]   And then I saw what the decision was and at first I was like, okay, they reaffirmed the
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.240]   decision, that seems fair and then I read more about it, I was like, oh no, this is
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.760]   a complete punse because then they're saying, oh, but you need to make a further decision
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.760]   about this.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.800]   I'm going to do it again if you really want to do it for any longer.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:20.600]   Yeah, so the thing just seems a punting and more hand-wringing to me and I don't know.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.240]   I personally think that the whole oversight board, to be honest, is just smoke and mirrors
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:33.480]   and it's designed to make certain congressional members of Congress feel better about things,
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.360]   but I don't really, I think that a lot of it is just pomp and circumstance and is smoke
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.680]   and mirrors and is kind of an effectual to be totally honest.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:47.120]   I don't feel like it, in most cases, I feel like they're probably going to reaffirm what
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.920]   Facebook has done or maybe go back on some things that some people at Facebook wish that
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.680]   they could do, but yeah, it's a complete punse.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.440]   It was one of those things where you wait for this decision and they hype it up as this
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.160]   big thing and it's like, nope, we're just going to continue to kick this down and say,
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.200]   well, no, this was okay, but now you need to come up with, is this indefinite or is this
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.160]   permanent or is this only for a certain period of time?
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   I don't know.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   Is that fair?
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.960]   Is that fair, Christina?
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.920]   Here's my thing about this.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.400]   It reads, if you go back to the oversight board, you can just go to oversightboard.com,
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.120]   great URL, and take a look for yourself.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.320]   A list of criticisms about the company, including things like it demands that Facebook undertake
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.320]   a comprehensive review of its potential contribution to the narrative of electoral fraud and the
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.960]   exacerbated tensions that culminated in the violence in the US on January 6th.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.760]   So to me, this is the board punting, but directly back into Facebook's face.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.320]   Like they didn't pun, oh, who's going to take care of it?
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.640]   They literally just threw it back really hard out their nose and said, you guys need to
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.120]   have some frickin' policies.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.880]   You need to do some gosh darn self criticism here and dig into how you run the company.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.720]   You can't just stop this off to us.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.400]   And so to me, that's better than you do.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   That's better than you.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   No, you're right.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.560]   You're not wrong, but I guess my underlying point is, and yeah, you're right, they were
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.560]   critical of the company.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.400]   I think that's really important and you see that.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:14.840]   But to me, it's sort of similar to an ombudsman of a newspaper and public editors who I think
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.720]   do a great service when they are employed.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.200]   But what power do you really have?
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.400]   Like what power does the oversight board really have?
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.400]   This is my point.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.160]   It's like they can throw this back at Facebook and say, Facebook, you need to do all these
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.160]   things.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.880]   But that doesn't actually force Facebook to do anything.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.080]   Facebook is still run by their board of directors, is still run by Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:35.520]   Well, that's the flaw in this whole thing, isn't it?
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:40.000]   That's the problem with the whole idea of this oversight board.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.240]   Go ahead.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:47.960]   Oh, so our reporter, Isi Lopowski, actually interviewed Thomas Hughes, who is the director
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.280]   of the board.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.640]   He oversees the administration.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.720]   So he's kind of in charge of the oversight board's operations.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.480]   And he made some really interesting points, which is that Facebook fundamentally asked
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.960]   the board to do something that was not in its charter.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.000]   And that's why we see what might look like a punt.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.840]   It's really, I think Alex is right.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.920]   It's a reverse punt.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.960]   It's saying, hey, Facebook, you tried to punt this to us.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.280]   You tried to palm it off on us.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.480]   We're not going to take it.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.040]   You got to resolve this.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.240]   That's an interesting tip.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.920]   And I think that was a really powerful statement, actually, of independence by the oversight
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.560]   board that they're not just going to cater to Facebook and give them a big leave when
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   they want it.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.720]   And the hard decisions still have to be made by Facebook, but they have to be done well
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   and responsibly.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:46.000]   That's what the people said about the oversight board is it's merely window dressing, that
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   it's a way of Facebook having plausible deniability.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.560]   Well, we have an oversight board.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.280]   So the oversight board said, we're not having any of this.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.720]   You better resolve this.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.200]   We're not going to take it off your hands.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.920]   I think that was the strongest statement the board could have made of their independence,
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.920]   really.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.920]   Yeah, that makes sense, actually.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.120]   Also, just throw up one more thing on this.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.520]   Like, you know, talk about who runs the company.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.520]   One person runs the company.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.520]   Yeah, it's Mark.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520]   It's his own control.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.520]   So like nothing else matters.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.400]   So like whenever we think about Facebook and, oh, was it Cheryl or was it the oversight
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.000]   board or was it the board of directors?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Was it Peter Thiel?
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   It's Mark.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   It's Mark's company.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.400]   He has decided to keep voting patrol in his hands.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   There we go.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   He's responsible for all of it.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.880]   Hands down in the story, close the books, you know?
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.480]   So if you don't want that responsibility, then let other people have more votes, for
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   sure.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.240]   You know, Jack Orsie, who runs Twitter, has been very clear, there's no oversight board.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.040]   We're not bringing Trump back ever, period.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.520]   End of story.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.760]   And Twitter actually deleted his account.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.600]   This is something people found very confusing about what Facebook did is you can still go
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.000]   to Donald Trump's Facebook page.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.600]   No, he's the last post has become this memorial.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   Yeah, it's really like, like if it's suspended, why can you still comment on it, which is
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   bizarre?
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.800]   So it really highlights that it's in this kind of never, never land.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   And yeah, Twitter is so adamant that when a account was created that was basically to
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.840]   repost what Trump has decided to do, he kind of played with the idea of a social network,
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.240]   he's doing a blog.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.960]   And so they created an account on Twitter that would say a new blog post.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.880]   Twitter took that down too.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.040]   They don't even want to see that.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   So that's...
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   I love that.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.080]   Leo, I absolutely loved it.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.920]   I mean, because first of all, a couple of things about this, there's been all this hype
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.080]   in the world of politics for 100 years now that Trump's going to take on Fox, Trump's
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.760]   going to buy Newsmax, Trump's going to buy away and then all this, all this stuff.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   And then time ticks ticks ticks ticks ticks ticks ticks ticks ticks.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.960]   And then finally, it is coming, guys.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.600]   And he drops a blog that could have been designed by a junior in high school.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.200]   And then he tries to share it.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   About RSS.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.120]   There you go.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.360]   It's a half blog.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.600]   It's a blog.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.120]   And then he tries to tweet it out.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.000]   And then Twitter is like, "We told you to go away.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.280]   You're not welcome here."
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.520]   And I thought it was one of the funniest, like no offense Leo, but like fail boomerisms,
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.480]   if you will, that I have seen in some time.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.640]   In fact, here it is.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.600]   It's from the desk of Donald J. Trump.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.720]   There he is writing in a book in Sharpie.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.440]   Obviously writing his blog.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.800]   Do you think he writes it?
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.480]   I think that this is what my personal theory is.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.960]   I think that they paid, and I would love to be able to see how much, because it was the
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.600]   campaign that paid for this or whatever, paid for someone to design an app, a mobile
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.440]   app that is basically like a mobile version of Twitter or WordPress that just lets him
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.240]   write in a text box and hit publish and then publishes all this stuff.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.240]   Yeah, because this is tweet length.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.200]   Yeah, I was going to say, I think it's the most recent which is today.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.040]   So now even our Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit is a junkie.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.920]   This is emblematic of what's, the only thing is the capitalization is not quite so kooky.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.160]   The whole world is laughing at us as we go to hell on our borders capital B, our fake
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.800]   presidential election capital P and everywhere else.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   It is.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.960]   It's your, it's your, it's your, it's your, it's your uncle's shot in it, your old uncle's
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.080]   shot in the clouds.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.560]   People were making jokes and I love this.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:19.800]   There was this thing in an early season of the office where BJ Novak's character Ryan gave
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.720]   creed a blog and it was just a word document that had a website.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:29.320]   It was like www.creepthoughts.com/www slash creepthoughts or something like that.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.920]   And people were making a meme that that's what this was.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.320]   And they're not wrong.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.120]   I feel like this is something where they're like, they opened up a word document.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:41.240]   They made like a, a one task app, you know, that they charged way too much for, and we're
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.600]   like here, just type in this and it'll go on the internet.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   It's just two a piece.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.600]   That's exactly right.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:52.400]   100% because honestly the former presidents have a pretty big opportunity to tell the world
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.920]   he could go on TV.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.400]   He could write a book as Obama has done.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:02.120]   There's lots of ways you could, you know, say what you want to say even without Twitter.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.840]   But apparently he prefers the 280 character format.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:12.000]   But the hard thing is going to come in 2023 and 2024.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.640]   What if he runs again?
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.280]   What are Facebook and Twitter going to do then?
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:21.560]   And if, you know, Twitter said like this is a lifetime permanent ban, you know, there's
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.720]   no coming back.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.640]   What is Facebook going to decide in six months?
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.080]   That's going to have a lot to do with the 2024 election.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:35.160]   It also fuels this concern that people have that private companies shouldn't be able to
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.080]   put their thumbs on the scale of a, of an election, right?
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:46.400]   Or of a political campaign that if somebody gets a nomination and is running, he should
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.160]   be treated like everybody else.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.440]   And so that is going to raise some very thorny ethical issues, I think.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.960]   Even on the flip side.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.280]   Sorry, I was just going to say, but on the flip side, like I think that then you're
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:05.640]   equating Twitter and Facebook to public, you know, funded like, you know, like network
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.440]   media, which goes back to like the FTC and the 30s and radio and then television, right?
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.520]   There's a reason why we're with FCC.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   Sorry.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.600]   Where you had those provisions in the FCC and that's why you had to have, you know, equal
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.400]   time clauses, which don't exist anymore.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.200]   But why those networks have to broadcast, simulcast, you know, debates and things like that.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.680]   I don't think that we're at the, at the point where we can say, I mean, maybe on a, a cultural
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.480]   level, Twitter and Facebook have that influence.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.880]   And I, I would argue that they do, but I don't know in terms of a, of a funding perspective
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.800]   and, and you know, oversight and the fact that they were not created by the government,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.080]   they weren't funded by those things that, that they don't use, you know, airwaves in
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.080]   that, in that way.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.200]   I guess they technically use the internet, which goes back to ARPANET.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   That's slightly different.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:54.520]   I don't know if you can make that same claim that like you are owed as a candidate the
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.280]   right to be on Facebook or Twitter.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   Right.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.360]   So our, our free speech principles have been designed around kind of like the idea of,
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.680]   you're in Boston and you can go down to the commons and you can shout whatever you want
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.280]   at anyone who happens to be there.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:14.960]   But what if, what if someone put up a, a tollgate in front of the commons and said,
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.320]   Mm, we're going to decide if you can, you know, you can enter the commons or not.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.400]   And like, hey, once you get past us, you have completely free speech, but, you know, we're,
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:29.680]   we're just going to, you know, but, you know, crossing, crossing this border, this barrier,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.800]   that's up to us because this is a private tollgate right here, which happens to be in
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.240]   front of the commons just coincidentally.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.680]   I think we're going to have to start thinking about, you know, the idea of free speech and
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.480]   the public square in a little more nuanced way because social media is the way our gatekeeper.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   Pete.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.480]   It's the way people engage with each other.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   That's a good point.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.560]   You know, that, that said, I think the idea of, of the government compelling speech is
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.160]   incredibly dangerous.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.320]   And when you talk about essentially forcing a company to let someone on, you're compelling
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:13.200]   that company to speak in a certain way, and I don't have a good way to thread those needles.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:17.360]   But I think, you know, I think we're going to have to spend a lot more time thinking about
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.680]   that in a really nuanced way.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:28.960]   What about this bill in Florida passed now through the legislature that offers significant
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.600]   fines for social media companies that ban politicians, clearly aimed at Twitter and Facebook,
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600]   right?
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.880]   The legislation allows platforms to suspend accounts, but only for two weeks.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.880]   And after that, could find the platforms as much as a quarter million dollars a day for
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.280]   violating the law.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.320]   What's weird is there is an exemption for Disney.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.960]   Yes, for theme parks.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   For theme parks.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.960]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.960]   And NBC or Russell.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   Right.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.000]   So they know where their bread is buttered, I guess.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.380]   And then of course, somebody said if Facebook bought a theme park, does that prevent us from
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.680]   being able to regulate what happens on Facebook?
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.120]   I'm sure this will be constitutionally challenged.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.120]   There's all sorts of things.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.040]   Yeah, I was going to say, I don't know how this is constitutional in any standpoint.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.640]   Like, I mean, they want to pass the bill because they want to make political hay for
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   their local elections.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:28.160]   And DeSantis can, you know, to wrap up his base for his presidential aspirations.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.520]   But there's no way this is constitutional at all.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   So I don't know.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.560]   And it is that compelled speech thing you were talking about on this is would essentially
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:41.160]   compelled these platforms to continue to host posts from anybody just because they were
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.960]   running for an office.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.520]   Well, I don't know what's wrong with you guys.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.880]   I've already bought my tickets to go to Oculus world.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.200]   I'm really excited to ride the VR rollercoaster.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.600]   You know, I could see my planning that I could totally see it.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.160]   And it's by the way, because it's Oculus, it could be in a small room.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.280]   It wouldn't have to be big.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.880]   You wouldn't have to do anything.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   It's all in your mind.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.080]   It's just a big, just a big closet.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.400]   But there's one more thing about this though.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.920]   So Owen and Leo are very good on the compelled speech point.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.840]   I think it's an important part of the conversation.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.160]   But one other thing we don't think about enough when we talk about this element is,
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.800]   you know, putting your thumb on the scale is a very, very broad thing.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.240]   And every one of these companies that provides an algorithmic feed by definition is putting
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.800]   their thumb on the scale of content.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   They're aware of the other.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   True.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.000]   So what do you do?
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.880]   Do you ban algorithmic feeds?
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.240]   Some people are talking about that, but that would be pretty bad, I think, for Facebook
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.480]   and Twitter's models.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.200]   So not to mention TikTok.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.440]   Well, TikTok's over without its algorithm.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.720]   Without an algorithm, there's nobody would watch it.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.680]   YouTube, without the recommendation engine, YouTube would just be a billion videos that
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.760]   you can't find anything on.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.640]   So it's very much like today, except for today, it gives you more Ben Shapiro than you'd
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   like.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:00.760]   But I mean, there's issues here.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.880]   The only thing that I'll say is everyone doesn't understand Section 230.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.040]   And the Ron DeSantis bill that we just discussed is just blatantly crap.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.800]   But it does go to show, I think, where the sentiment is in a large part of the American
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.200]   electorate.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.520]   This is what people want.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:21.600]   They want to be mad at coastal techies essentially.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.240]   And they won't let facts get in the way of it.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.040]   So we're going to be hearing about this until the cows come home, which makes me pretty
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.920]   mad because it's a discussion with a lot of bad faith in it.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   It's pretty cheap.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.720]   They know that it's unconstitutional.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.160]   It's a state saying something about interstate commerce.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.680]   It's a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   They know that.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.680]   You're right.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.520]   It's for talking points entirely.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.520]   Wait, I thought Florida was on the coast.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.680]   Well, so Florida actually occupies a very specific part of space time.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.400]   Oh, and it's where reality takes--
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   Alex knows this.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.400]   --the deeper it is.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   Alex knows this, right?
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   You've been there.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.400]   You've been.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   I've actually never been to Florida.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.680]   I've hoarded it my entire life.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.800]   I thought we could saw it off in the bottom of the country like that.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   Florida is in Florida way.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.960]   Florida is a good state.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.160]   I do like your idea of a Disney world in the closet, though.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.160]   I think that's a--
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.720]   Yeah, an Oculus world.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   I like that, too.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.760]   I really think that might actually happen.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   I could see that.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.760]   You're listening, Mark, here are some free ideas.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.760]   Here's some free ideas.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.000]   You can have-- you want the metaverse.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   So you can do that.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   I'm sorry about--
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.880]   And if you're just tuning in, Christina is not nursing a baby.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.880]   Don't get excited.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.080]   This is her nephew, Christian.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.080]   And he's a really sweet eight-year-old.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.480]   He's a bit very patient with us even though--
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.480]   Eight days, Leo.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.480]   Not eight years.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.480]   Did I say eight years?
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.480]   Eight days.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.480]   You did.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   If he was crying that much of eight years, we'd have a problem.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.320]   But he was just very, very age-appropriate.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.320]   Yes.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.320]   Eight years.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.320]   Oh, no.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   Kindergarten.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:53.320]   Oh, no.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   Kindergarten.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.400]   You can breathe freely because we've got molecule running.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.720]   I've had molecule at home for a long time.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.720]   Lisa loves it.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.160]   She knows when the molecule's not working.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.680]   She says, did you unplug the molecule by accident?
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.960]   Oh, yes.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.000]   Because she can tell.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   She can tell.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Indoor air, in general, can be up to five times worse
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:14.800]   than outdoor air.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.040]   And if you're in an office, you're coming back to the office.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.560]   And you've got to breathe that air.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.920]   You want to tell them about molecule.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.320]   Molecules re-imagining the future of clean air, starting with the air purifier.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.120]   Now, we're not talking about a filtration system here.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   It's not an innovation on the existing filters, but it's a breakthrough in air purification
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.720]   called PICO, photoelectrochemical oxidation.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:44.960]   It's got a catalyst in the-- we got our molecule a couple of years ago.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.760]   Really just so cool.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.720]   When you open it up, you've got this catalytic converter in there.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:58.040]   It's a piece of metal that actually traps the pollutants and then destroys them with
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.000]   light.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.600]   Tiny particles that can't be captured by a filter, viruses, bacteria, mold, volatile
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:14.000]   organic compounds, things like formaldehyde, the gases coming off of carpeting, destroyed,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.640]   not trapped but destroyed.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.560]   Air purifiers are designed to protect homes, businesses, and medical spaces.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.480]   There's a variety now, which is really nice.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.120]   We got the original molecule air some years ago.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.600]   We've got two at home.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.680]   We had one in the studio.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:33.920]   We just got the new big molecule for the studio, which I love.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.240]   It's the molecule A.R.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.800]   Pro for rooms up to 1,000 square feet.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   There's a molecule A.R.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.240]   Many, if you've got a small room or maybe just one bedroom, 250 square feet.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.440]   The original A.R., which we had for the 600 square feet.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:51.680]   They also have the mini plus now, which has sensors in it.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.240]   The particle sensor and the auto protect mode will adjust the fan speed based on the sensor.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.840]   If you're in a medical office, a dental office, you want to know about the molecule A.R.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:06.560]   Pro RX for medical purposes, specifically to destroy bacteria and viruses in the A.R.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.760]   In fact, if you're going back to the dentist's office, as I did, you want to check.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.160]   You got a molecule in here because I really want to make sure it's safe.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.480]   Clean indoor air, more important than ever, molecules, Pico technology meets the performance
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:26.280]   requirements and FDA's guidance for use in helping reduce the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.440]   That's the COVID-19 virus in healthcare settings.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.720]   It meets the performance requirements in the FDA guidance.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.600]   Of course, you still don't want to do all the good preventative stuff, but if people are
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.440]   coming back to work, not just washing hands and social distancing, you want this extra
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.520]   layer of virus protection for your spaces.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.600]   Molecules technology and filtration systems have been tested and verified by independent
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:54.480]   third-party labs for your whole home and beyond that Pico technology is available in
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.720]   an entire range of products, a clean air solution.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   Just pick the unit that's best for your space.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.200]   Or if you've got multiple spaces as we do and you want multiple molecules, you can create
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.840]   a discounted bundle as well.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:10.160]   For a limited time, you'll save up to $120 on your Molecule Air Purifier.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:17.200]   It's M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E, Molecule with a K, not a C, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:22.400]   Don't forget the promo code TWIT120, enter the code TWIT120, use that at checkout.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:27.280]   Enjoy free shipping in a 30-day at-home trial, too, so there's absolutely no risk on your
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.800]   order, but you can't take our molecules away.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:36.000]   I'll tell you what, M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com, Molecule.com.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.920]   Thank you, Molecule, for helping keeping us safe over this last year.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.600]   Believe me, we're going to keep it going.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.920]   Keep it running.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.200]   Let's see, Apple.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:51.040]   This Apple Epic trial is the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:55.560]   Not only is it just fun, it's entertaining to watch, and it's a bench trial.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.280]   There's no jury.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.200]   The fireworks are all aimed at the judge, the poor judge.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:10.040]   But Discovery has really given us a lot of interesting stuff.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:20.800]   For instance, Fortnite, which is Epic's big title, has made more than $9 billion for Epic
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.200]   in the first two years.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.600]   This is also part of the discovery.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:31.840]   Apple's point, I guess, is, "Hey, we're not holding them back."
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   $9 billion.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.400]   That ain't bad.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.360]   Apple's done all right, too, though.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:45.280]   The testimony from Epic's expert witness said that Apple's App Store had a 78% margin
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.280]   in 2019.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.680]   That's a nice profit margin.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.400]   Is that credible?
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.400]   I mean, remember it is a-
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.400]   Apple disputes that.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.120]   Yeah, of course they did.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.120]   Right.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   And they also-
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.120]   They said you have an interest.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:02.800]   Incidentally, they urged the judge to restrict public discussion of App Store profit.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:08.080]   So your honor, that figure is wrong, but we would prefer that you'd not talk about
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   it, okay?
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.920]   It's like Apple, we know you're rich.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   Like, calm down.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   Everyone's aware that you make-
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.720]   You all know, guys.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.280]   Does Apple also want us not to look at Barbara Streisand's house?
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.280]   Yes.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   Nothing to see here.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.360]   Nothing to see here.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.360]   We don't make 78%.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.720]   Can I just give a shout out, though?
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:33.800]   So over on the verge, Elizabeth wrote a piece about this, and it has the best, I think, lead
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.080]   of anything I've read about the Apple Epic trial.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.640]   And it says, "If you have ever wanted to see a bunch of mumbly nerds struggle to define
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.480]   what constitutes a game, well, Epic vs. Apple is the trial for you."
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.800]   I think that summarizes my entire take on the hearing.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.880]   It's two pigs in the same pile of crap wrestling over each other, trying to talk about how
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.240]   much money they deserve.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.240]   It's whimsical to me.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.000]   Yeah, but it's not completely inconsequential.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:06.040]   The app store is a big part of Apple's profits, clearly, whether it's 78% or not.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:12.200]   The iPhone is, while not the best-selling phone in the world, it's certainly the best-selling
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.640]   phone in the United States.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.160]   We also are learning a little bit about how the app store works, which Apple's always
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.920]   been very careful not to reveal.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:29.240]   For instance, and this is, again, from Discovery, and testimony, in this case, by one of the
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:33.080]   heads of the app store, there are 5 million apps.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.480]   5 million apps are submitted to the app store every year.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.640]   The rejection rate is less than half, 40%.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:48.160]   60% get through of the rejected apps, 215,000 infringed Apple's privacy guidelines.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.800]   By the way, most of the rejections are not appealed.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:56.640]   The developer puts their tail behind their legs and fixes it and comes back less than
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:03.840]   1% of developers appeal the rejection.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:10.160]   They also said, and I'm trying to find that, 500 people doing the reviews.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.440]   I'm going to do some math.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.680]   500 people, 100,000 apps a week.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:21.040]   It's 2,000 apps a person a week if my math is correct.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.400]   How do you work on a five-day week?
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.760]   That's 400 apps a day.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:34.480]   You're working an eight-hour day that's 50 apps an hour.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.960]   That's 15 hours.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.280]   It's basically one minute.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.000]   That's if you don't get lunch.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.520]   You don't have a lot of time.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.960]   There are automated tools they use.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.960]   You have to.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.640]   I would assume that most of what they're doing is running automated tools.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   I don't know.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.000]   This is just my own inference from what they're saying, that they're using automated testing
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.440]   tools to go through the contents, to look for certain things.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:04.040]   Then if something comes back looking weird, then maybe they need to check it out.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.680]   Stuff gets through, though.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:12.480]   In fact, another revelation, which is very depressing.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:22.920]   You might remember that about 2015, there was a malicious Xcode discovered that was offered
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:30.960]   especially to Chinese developers saying it'll be faster to download this Xcode Ghost, which
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.320]   is Xcode, but we're getting it from Chinese servers.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:36.120]   It'll be faster for you than trying to get it from Apple's servers.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:39.760]   Apparently, a lot of developers used it.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.600]   Of course, it was malware.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:48.080]   It allowed any program that was written with Xcode Ghost had payload that would allow remote
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.280]   access plus gathering information from the phone.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:57.480]   Turns out, more than 4,000 apps used this Xcode Ghost.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:06.040]   They were downloaded 203 million times by 128 million users, mostly in China, only about
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.440]   18 million users in the United States.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:16.520]   Here's the unfortunate exchange of emails from Apple executives at the time who considered
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:24.880]   notifying all 128 million affected users and then decided, maybe not.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:31.520]   They decided, "We're going to pull the apps.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.120]   That's all we're going to do."
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.640]   128 million.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:40.320]   By the way, many different languages, it might have been a challenge, but is it Apple's response?
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:43.680]   You think Alex that they absolutely should have done that?
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.000]   Yeah, I went up to it.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Come on.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.160]   If you have a mistake of this magnitude, if so many apps are written with a malicious
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:56.800]   IDE, I suppose, and you end up helping to compromise this many accounts, you should be
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.880]   honest about it.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.880]   Speak about it.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.880]   I mean, Christina is on.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.880]   If Microsoft did this, I would say the same things and think about alphabetical or whatever.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:08.280]   In fairness, we had a similar situation without what the SolarWinds fiasco, right?
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:13.160]   The SolarWinds thing, that was SolarWinds software, but then it was able to make changes
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.040]   on people's machines.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:20.440]   Did Microsoft or the Exchange server issues, did they notify Alex?
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   They did patch it.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.080]   I don't know if they notified everyone.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.640]   It would be difficult to notify everyone.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:30.840]   It would depend on how they joined or signed up for the service.
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:36.240]   But I will say, it's one of those situations where there was public announcements all over
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.720]   the blogs, all the channels.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:43.080]   A tool was created for people who don't have an IT administrator to go through and do things.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:49.200]   It was not one of those things where it was not discussed, right?
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:54.360]   To the point that governments were taking, like local governments, are taking the task
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:58.480]   of saying we might have to go through some of these servers or ourselves to patch things
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.320]   if they're unpached.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.560]   So the SolarWinds thing was another scenario where it's like, yeah, when that happened,
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.560]   you're public about it.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.680]   Apple never even published a list of all the apps affected.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:14.320]   They only published a list of the 25 most downloaded apps and said if users have one
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.200]   of these apps, they should update the affected app, which will fix the issue on the user's
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.680]   device if the app is available in the app store.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.720]   It has been updated if it isn't available.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.600]   It should be updated very soon.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.480]   Gee, it would have been nice to say here's the 4,000 apps.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.800]   If you have one of these deleted immediately, that would have been the right thing to do.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:38.040]   Right, or to release an app on the app store that goes through and says if you have this
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:42.200]   installed, put a pop-up because this is wrong and uninstalled.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.960]   They have the ability to do this sort of thing.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.640]   They haven't used it in the past.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.720]   I know that it would be a really slippery slope to do remote removal or execution of
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.200]   stuff, but they have the ability to do that.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.760]   I think for me, and I'm not advocating that they should have done that, but to me, yeah,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.040]   to Alex's point, and I would say this for any company, if you do this, own up to it.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.840]   But especially, it is the right thing to do.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.600]   It's the best thing for the safety of your customers.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.560]   But secondarily, when your whole MO and a big part of your marketing campaign and a
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.280]   big part of the things that you say that you were better than everyone else at is privacy
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.600]   and security.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.160]   When you don't do this, this to me is just like, how are you able to take care of your
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.760]   social media, take the moral high ground in the things that you put with iOS 14.5 that
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.560]   make Facebook and Google and other places angry?
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.160]   How are you able to have that sense of, "Oh, we're so much better."
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.680]   If you're not willing to own up when things go wrong and things were in your app store
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:44.600]   that were created with a malicious IDE, like, is it Apple's fault that the IDE was malicious?
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600]   No.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.640]   But once that stuff gets into your store, you owe it to your customers to be transparent
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.400]   about how they can know that that happened and that they can get rid of those applications.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:02:00.280]   By the way, with iOS 14.5, I remember Facebook was very upset Apple introduced its new application
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.600]   tracking system that allowed you to opt out of tracking.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:12.160]   According to Flurry, 96% of iPhone users are opting out.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.800]   It's as bad as Facebook's worst nightmare.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.080]   Why would anybody say yes if asked?
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.480]   But boy, I didn't think it would be that high.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.640]   96%.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.280]   I am vindicated, Leo.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   I am vindicated because people for so long have been telling me privacy is dead.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.480]   No one cares about privacy.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.040]   Alex, your complaints are stupid.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.040]   You're archaic.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.040]   You were a dinosaur.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.920]   Please turn into oil to be continuous, be useful.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.440]   Look, I was right.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.080]   People don't like to be scared.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.680]   When asked, when asked outright, do you want this app to track you?
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680]   People say, "No."
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680]   No.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.040]   It's a big deal.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.600]   This is an emerging area for regulation.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.560]   Congress is actually talking about dark patterns.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:01.600]   The normal way Facebook asks users about privacy is, "Hey, would you like Facebook to be super
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   duper awesome, fantastic?"
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.960]   Exactly what they say.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.760]   Click here if you want us to be your Facebook to be more awesome.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:19.880]   Apple has called the bluff on the whole dark patterns industry here by having a very clear,
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.000]   "Hey, do you want to be tracked?
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.880]   If you're cool being tracked, then you can click here to let people track you."
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:35.080]   When you bring these things out into the light, I think people are not very happy about them.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:41.920]   This idea that people don't care about privacy is because companies like Facebook have worked
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.160]   very, very hard to make sure you don't understand what privacy even means.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.960]   It's 11% globally.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.240]   Americans seem to care more, which is funny.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.680]   I wouldn't have said this, but Americans seem to care more considerably more than the rest
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.520]   of the world.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.480]   Still a vast majority of people say, "Don't track me.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.080]   Don't track me, bro."
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.800]   I have to say in the defense of tracking, the question is very...
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   Sorry, that's amazing.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   In defense of murder.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   Let me just give this out.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   Stop murder!
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.640]   It's very simple.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   It's just...
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.280]   Anyway, in defense of this, that is a very binary black and white question that gives
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.480]   you no context at all.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.880]   If you say, "Do you want an app to track you," of course everybody's going to say no, because
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.360]   it's not explaining exactly what's going on.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:43.520]   There should be a little nuance there about, "Hey, by the way, if you say no here, your
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.680]   ads are going to be generic and kind of annoying."
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.960]   You may be impacting the ability to monetize for some of your favorite apps and sites,
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.320]   etc.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.560]   There are reasons why you might want to say, "Yeah, go ahead, let them track me."
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:07.520]   Honestly, it's not like letting them track me means that somebody in the CIA is going
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.360]   to have me on a screen at all times knowing everything I do.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.440]   That's not what we're talking about, but that's what tracking implies, right?
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.360]   That somebody's watching everything you're doing.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.720]   I think Facebook has done something really insidious too, and they're lobbying around
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.520]   this issue and the advertising...
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.360]   Yeah, small businesses.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.960]   It's all about small businesses.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:33.440]   I think Facebook and Google have done a fantastic thing for small businesses, and that's to
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:39.680]   make advertising easy to buy, but conflating the ease of use, the fact that you can just
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:50.240]   put a credit card down and very simply buy ads with targeting, I think that is so insidious.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:58.880]   The truth is that the targeting, the micro-targeting that Facebook allows, for most advertisers,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:06.640]   it's kind of useless because you just want to vaguely target it to a large group of people.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:10.240]   If you're an e-commerce company, you don't want to micro-target it because you want a
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.680]   lot of people to buy it.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:19.560]   You might want to get your ads in front of relevant people and not waste your ads, but
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:27.560]   the idea that you need a lot of detailed information about people has been proven wrong in the marketplace.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:31.000]   Everybody on this panel, everybody listens or shows, knows what that means, but I would
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.600]   say of the 96% of people saying, "No, don't track me."
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.480]   More than half don't really know what they're saying, no, too.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.840]   They just don't like the word track.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.560]   I agree.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560]   I'm not on Facebook.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.080]   I don't have anything to do with Facebook.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.880]   I saw the other day on Reddit.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:55.120]   I don't know if this is real or not that somebody, Facebook from time to time will say, "We
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.880]   want to make sure it's really you.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.240]   Send us a picture of your driver's license, that kind of thing."
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.160]   I've seen that.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:06.840]   Somebody said the other day that Facebook said, "We want to make sure this is really you."
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.200]   We're going to now do face recognition on you.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.920]   Hold your camera up.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:18.640]   Turn your face left and right so that we can check to make sure this is really you.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.240]   By the way, we'll throw out the data afterwards.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.800]   Stop locking into Facebook.ru, everybody.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.880]   That's not the place you want to go.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:33.280]   I think Facebook, unfortunately, is given tracking a bad name.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:41.240]   It's completely, I think, people were over-reacting to that, thanks to Facebook.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.240]   Interesting.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.240]   Interesting.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:48.400]   Because I think advertisers want to know that when they buy an ad, it's going to go to somebody
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.960]   who's interested in their product.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.960]   They don't want to sell.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:59.200]   They don't want to buy an ad for Alex if he's not interested in men's hair care products.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.680]   They want to make sure that they advertise to people who are interested in buying.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   I don't think that for an advertiser, that's not an evil thing.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:13.200]   Although there have been studies that have shown, and I haven't read them super recently,
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.760]   but there have been, it's been interesting to look at how well-targeted advertising works
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.440]   versus untargeted in terms of how successful those campaigns are.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.040]   The delta is smaller than you would think.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040]   Yeah, I'm not surprised.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.360]   I'm not lost in the slightest.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.760]   Because a lot of times, things are awareness campaigns.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:31.440]   A lot of times, I think it can, to Owens Point, get really insidious when you're able to
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.720]   micro-target to certain degrees where I'm not really comfortable having that micro-targeting
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.880]   capabilities, to be honest.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.520]   Even if advertisers think it would be really helpful to have them do that, and I'm in favor
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.000]   of advertisers existing and us supporting.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.320]   I've worked my previous career was funded by advertisers, journalism.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:54.000]   I'm very sympathetic to understanding why having that data is useful.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.280]   I think sometimes it's insidious in the way that it's used or in ways that should not
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.880]   be relevant to them.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:04.120]   More interestingly, when you look at the data, the delta between the super-targeted stuff
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:09.680]   versus the more broad things, the super-targeted stuff often isn't that much more successful.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.720]   I sometimes question, what are we giving up as humans?
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.320]   Do we really need it?
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.360]   For advertisers, how much better off are they versus just making a big mass ad buy to go
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.520]   after a certain demographic, if that's what they can do?
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   Well, they're pretty convinced.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.520]   Or anybody who might be watching or viewing stuff.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.680]   There's been some really excellent research on that.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.360]   But advertisers seem convinced that they need that information.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.320]   Of course, of course they want it.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   I understand that.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.880]   I just say for us, for instance, in podcasting where we can't really do that because it's
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.520]   an RSS feed.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520]   Right.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:48.560]   So, we are losing advertisers to companies like Spotify that can, that totally know exactly
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.280]   what you listen to when you listen to it, who you are.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.000]   And they're really offering advertisers something they want.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.720]   Alex, you may hate tracking, but your company relies on it.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   Right.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.240]   Well, actually, it's interesting.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.760]   So I work for TechCrunch.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.760]   We do.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:08.760]   But we have a direct ad sales team.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.840]   We have our own internal system to some degree.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.480]   And people come to buy ads on TechCrunch because they care about our audience.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480]   Well, that's right.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.480]   Which is a form of tracking to be clear.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.880]   But that's the same thing for Twit.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.520]   You know, if you're advertising on Twit, you're talking to a tech savvy audience.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   Right.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   Precisely.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.040]   And I think that if the more average person, the people that you're arguing in favor of,
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.960]   their perspective, and I think it's a good point, really understood how much information
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.400]   about them was being collected, sold and used to target against them.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.080]   And if, as Christina points out, it's not that effective, they would be freaked out.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.320]   And I think the reason why they.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.400]   That was the point of this signal campaign on Instagram, which Facebook apparently did
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.120]   not allow Facebook denies it.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.120]   They say they never tried.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.640]   This is a publicity stunt signal.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:56.320]   Of course, is the encrypted messenger run by open whisper systems in Moxie, Marlon's bike.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.000]   And these are the ads that they wanted to buy on Instagram.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   Here's one.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   You got this.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   This is from the signal blog.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.480]   Because you're a newlywed Pilates instructor and your cartoon crazy.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.560]   This ad used location to see you're in La Jolla.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:17.040]   You're into parenting blogs and thinking about LGBTQ adoption.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.960]   And there's more and more of these Facebook.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.920]   Apparently not only rejected the ads, but deleted signals account so they could never
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.040]   attempt this again.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.200]   Well within Facebook's rights, they denied that that happened.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:39.080]   Although, signal did post in the blog the actual screenshot of ad account disabled.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.080]   So maybe.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.560]   I have a theory here.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:48.120]   And this is not to excuse Facebook's misdeeds.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:57.520]   But I suspect signal was trying to drill down in a way that Facebook's protection mechanisms
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:05.640]   decided was someone trying to ferret out information or discover all the categories.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:11.760]   Basically, it probably looked like a competitor trying to live information from the system.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.920]   Signal could be directly with Facebook messenger.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.840]   That's exactly what the point of the ads was, right?
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:26.760]   But I think the thing is there's probably like one person like that ad, right?
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:30.960]   And Facebook system is not designed to deliver an ad to one person.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.960]   Right.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   Right.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:38.160]   Furthermore, honestly, it's well within Facebook's rights not to accept an advertisement that
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.800]   slimes the slanders.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:40.800]   No.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:46.440]   And also, no, is a ugly person.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.520]   And you shouldn't list those shows.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.800]   I'm not going to let you buy that ad.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:49.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.000]   He can't tie his tie very well.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.760]   He smells like.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.560]   You know, now I smell you haven't been in here in years.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.800]   Actually, your title is great to be clear.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.800]   I was picking a random.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.880]   It does look like an obvious thing to just you on.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:06.880]   But where you do see this kind of like micro targeting used effectively is in political campaigns.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.880]   Yes.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.040]   Most famously the Trump campaign, you know, under Brad, Brad for Sala.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.960]   We looked at the ad buys that politics political campaigns.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:22.320]   I think actually the Trump campaign made and they were all sub hundred dollars.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.240]   So that means they're buying a handful of ads highly targeted and they're making thousands
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.240]   of buys.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.880]   It's automated.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.440]   And by the way, let's not forget Facebook had a person embedded in the Trump campaign
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:41.760]   in 2016 to help them master that system because this is the whole point of Facebook's advertising
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.760]   system.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.920]   So I will agree with you that anybody who's paying any attention at all understands that
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:53.000]   there is absolutely ugly things being done with tracking, particularly by Facebook.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.520]   But that question in iOS 14.5 is just, you know, I mean, who's going to say yes?
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.680]   I'm surprised even 4% said yes.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   I don't care.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.360]   You know, who said yes, those 4% sell ads.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.440]   Lisa gets mad at me every time I turn on ad blocking because I do household wide ad block.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.600]   Leo, we sell ads for a living.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.560]   You cannot turn off ads.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.280]   I was told by the tech crunch ad team to whitelist our site after they figured out that I was
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.920]   blocking on tech.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.800]   So I now do not block ads on my home side because it seems to be counterintuitive to
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.320]   my desire to stay employed with my kids.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.320]   Exactly.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320]   Exactly.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.560]   I filed a bug report about our CMS the other week, you know, because like the infinite
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:43.000]   squirrel of stories wasn't working right or something like that.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.360]   And they were like, do you have an ad blocker turned on?
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.360]   Whoops.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.960]   So it was it was it was blocking the content as well as the ads.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.560]   I have a terrible story.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:59.680]   Actually, we have we use ADP, which is a payroll service for Twit.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.120]   And they also do our HR.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.800]   And every couple of years we have to do a harassment training.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.040]   Managers have to do a longer one.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.600]   I think ours was two and a half hours longer than employees.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.880]   But everybody in the company has to do it.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880]   That's really good.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:15.960]   It encourages a healthy workplace and I completely support it.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.960]   But I couldn't get in.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.560]   I logged into ADP and then it said, all right, now click the learning section and we'll start
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560]   our training.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.560]   I clicked it and then one of my passwords again and it wouldn't work.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.840]   It's finally called tech support.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.720]   And they said, Oh, are you using Chrome?
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.400]   I said, no, I'm using Safari.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.760]   No, you have to use Chrome.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.760]   Okay.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.520]   Let me get into your computer.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.520]   I could fix this.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.800]   No, you're not going to get in my computer.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.800]   I'm a tech guy.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.800]   You tell me what I need to do.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.040]   He said, well, you got a turn on third party cookies.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040]   Okay.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.040]   That was off.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.680]   You got to turn off all tracking protection.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   Okay.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.240]   And you got to make sure flash is installed.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.240]   What?
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.240]   What year is this?
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.240]   14, 12?
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:02.760]   I said, I said to the guy, I said, you know that even Adobe doesn't make flash anymore.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:09.880]   They stopped last year and Microsoft on Tuesday is going to remove flash from every Windows
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.720]   users computer and their patch Tuesday.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.800]   You know that he said, yeah, I know.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.840]   I'm sorry, but I have to tell you that.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.680]   And by the way, it worked.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.040]   I fixed it.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.840]   I turned off tracking, turned on third party cookies.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.160]   Badeshare flash was working.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.840]   Can we go back to the point that Leah was using Safari because I'm very curious about
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.960]   why that's the case because I'm on a match a little more.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.960]   I was on a Mac.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.960]   I like it.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.600]   I'm not using Safari on Windows.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.840]   I use Edge on Windows.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.360]   I was not trying to imply you were running Safari in Windows 10.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:42.840]   But I was just curious why you're running Safari full stop.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.320]   What's the preference there?
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:50.280]   I thought where Leo's story was going to go was that the tech person was going to tell
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.880]   him he had to run Internet Explorer.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880]   Practically practically.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.400]   Practically, I fact I didn't run Chrome.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.640]   I was on a Windows machine.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.920]   So I ran Edge, but which worked just fine once I turned off all the data.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.920]   Tracking protection.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:09.800]   No, I use Safari on Macs because on a laptop Safari is on an M1 laptop, especially Safari
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:13.280]   is fast and is low battery use.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.280]   It's the right browser.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.960]   It's the battery thing.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.480]   The downside is actually it's funny you talk about AdTrack, AdBlocking.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.480]   You block Origin.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.080]   There are content blockers for Safari, but they're not very good on Safari.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:30.880]   That's the biggest reason I don't use Safari on my Mac as my default is that I can't block
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   Origin.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.440]   I use Firefox almost everywhere.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.920]   I'm using it right now on Linux because of you block Origin.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.680]   Yes, it doesn't work on Safari anymore.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.120]   But you know what I do, Christina?
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.200]   I'm sneaky.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.000]   I use basically a pie hole in the sky called DNS.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.080]   So next DNS at next DNS.io allows you in effect to filter everything.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.820]   It's a DNS provider, but because you're doing all the DNS through it, it blocks all
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.260]   that you can turn on.
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:06.720]   That's where Lisa yells at me because I have to unblock her machine.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:12.040]   I just unblock her machine and I leave it running everywhere else.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.920]   You just told a lot of people that, Leo.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.400]   You do know that Lisa is recording this.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.400]   She's actually listening.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.080]   It's so bad.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:24.100]   We Tivo stuff because who wants to watch commercials?
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.340]   She won't let me skip through the camera.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:29.580]   She's, you know, I want to see who's advertising on this show, but she does her ad.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.580]   Right.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.480]   I was going to say because she's interested.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.320]   She's wrong with Tivo.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.320]   All right.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320]   Okay.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.600]   If I was going to come first, Alex Blotnock Safari.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.080]   And now Owen is saying Tivo.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.920]   What's wrong with Tivo?
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.640]   Twenties, that is your personal technology hour.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   I'm on a cable, man.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.640]   That's how I get my.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.320]   Cut the cord, man.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   Cut the cord.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.480]   Well, I actually have a YouTube TV account, but I guess I won't be running it on Roku
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.480]   anymore.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.400]   Hey, oh, hi, oh.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:05.940]   This is, is this the usual battle used to be it would be the satellite company's battling
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:06.940]   like the CW.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.940]   I actually remember.
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.780]   It's the carriage dispute.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.780]   Right.
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:11.780]   The carriage dispute.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:16.620]   Amazon and, and Google did this over the fire TV, but I think it was like in the opposite
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.620]   direction.
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.620]   Right.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.620]   It was.
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:24.420]   And I had to download Firefox on my fire TV to access YouTube, which was like, like the,
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:29.900]   you know, the attempted block was completely pointless, but yeah, I think we're going to
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:35.160]   be seeing this kind of posturing, these kind of, you know, blocks and workarounds.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.500]   Google, it turns out, is trying to bake YouTube TV into the YouTube app.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:44.740]   So they're kind of calling Roku's bluff and saying, Hey, do you want to have YouTube?
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:46.740]   Then you have to take YouTube TV.
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.780]   Chris Welch on the Verge says it's the nuclear option.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:50.780]   Oh, totally.
[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:54.060]   By adding you to TV to the main YouTube app.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.580]   What are you going to do, Roku?
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:56.580]   Kill YouTube.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:57.580]   Go ahead.
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:58.580]   Totally.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.980]   I mean, it's similar though.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:06.500]   We saw something similar happen a couple of years ago when Netflix left the app store,
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.180]   or not left the app store, but left in that purchase because they were like, we don't
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.900]   need to pay Apple 30% or even 15% anymore.
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.060]   Screw that.
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.580]   They still added a, if you need to sign up for an account, here's a, here's a button
[01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:23.380]   that you can click link, which is against the app store policies to be clear.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:24.660]   But what is Apple going to do?
[01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.100]   Kick Netflix out of the app store?
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.260]   I mean, seriously, like, like, no, they're not.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:34.260]   There was a time when I think you could argue that, you know, Apple was more important than
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.700]   Netflix was like the more powerful player in that relationship, but that is no longer
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:38.700]   the case.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.700]   At this point, you know, if Netflix wanted to call Apple's bluff, they would win.
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.100]   And it was clear when they, you know, had that sign up link.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.460]   I think they might have originally gotten rid of it, but they had it there and they're,
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:48.700]   it's like, what are you going to do?
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:51.900]   You know, not let us have a sign up for an account.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.700]   You think it's Google or Roku?
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.060]   Who's the villain in this?
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.060]   You know what?
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:00.020]   I think Roku is, even though most people are siding with, with Roku, I, I think that Roku
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:04.380]   is because, you know, they seem to be wanting to change the carriage things.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:10.340]   They seem to be wanting to use the time to renegotiate the YouTube TV contract to renegotiate
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:16.460]   the YouTube contract, which is going to be up in six months, which is fair, but don't
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:22.540]   do that and then expect the company who is, look, is, is Roku bigger than YouTube TV
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:23.940]   without a doubt?
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.900]   Is YouTube bigger than Roku?
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:26.900]   Undoubtedly.
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:28.540]   Like, what are you doing, Roku?
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:31.700]   Like, it's the family of the giants, but we lose.
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:32.700]   Customers lose.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:36.220]   Well, well, that's the whole thing where I come down, like, regardless of who is really
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:38.980]   more evil and yeah, Google's probably posturing some.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.460]   I'm always going to come down in favor of the consumer.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:47.420]   And if the consumer is being told, I can no longer use my service that I've used successfully
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:52.140]   on this device because the device maker wants to get more money and wants to get a better
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.740]   ad split and wants something else from Google.
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.620]   Like me as the consumer, I don't care.
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.580]   It's the same reason we're in other care issues.
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:03.220]   Like, I didn't care if, you know, ABC and Comcast were fighting.
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:05.340]   I just want to be able to watch the Super Bowl.
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:09.100]   It's just the answer is not take it away from the consumer.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:13.300]   You're always going to blame, or really as I think you should, like, whoever is going,
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.500]   is making it possible for the consumer not to be able to watch their content.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.180]   Regardless of who is more morally parked.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.860]   Both parties are acting.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:20.860]   So Alex, you disagree?
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:24.060]   You think Google is the evil empire here?
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.460]   Well, I mean, Google is the bigger company.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:30.260]   And just to be clear, I'm a YouTube TV subscriber and a YouTube user.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.060]   Though, I have a different solution to this problem.
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:36.060]   I have a similar issue with getting things to work on my Apple TV, but that's because
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:38.820]   the control interface is so bad you can't really make it work.
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.820]   God, that really, oh my God.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:42.820]   Also, so I'm sorry, Leo.
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:45.860]   You can cut the side of the show, but I'm taking 10 seconds on this.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.260]   I lost my Apple TV remote.
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.140]   So I use the app on my phone.
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:50.500]   There are two versions of it.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.500]   One that you download.
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.540]   One that comes from your little pull down screen.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.540]   Right.
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.540]   They're different.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:56.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.540]   They never remember what television you're on.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:01.340]   I have one Apple TV and I always have to reselect it.
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:04.860]   And then sometimes they load the plus minus 10 second things.
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.860]   Sometimes they don't.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.860]   Sometimes they just go away.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:10.980]   It's the most infuriating experience that I've ever had you endure as a consumer in Apple.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.500]   You have literally God's own bank account.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:17.700]   Hire one guy to make one good software app for your Apple TV.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.460]   They literally do have one guy.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:23.780]   The Apple remote software wasn't updated for years because he was transferred to another
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:28.580]   project and eventually said, you know, you got to come back and update that remote because
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:31.980]   it's it literally is Alex one guy.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:36.420]   And by the way, I could fix this, but you need to turn on third party tracking cookies.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:39.460]   And you won't have this problem.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:44.940]   I'm just saying I live on Apple products and I just want to say, say, Apple, call me.
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.540]   I've got about six things to fix.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.540]   And then you'll be great.
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.540]   You'll be done.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.180]   There are a few irritations.
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.340]   I admit here.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:57.260]   Let me just read this because this is Roku's statement about the whole thing.
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:58.740]   And I just love it.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.540]   It's salacious as hell.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:06.380]   Google's actions are the clear conduct of an unchecked monopolist bent on crazy.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:10.340]   Prushing fair competition and harming consumer choice.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:16.340]   The bundling announcement by YouTube highlights the kind of predatory business practices used
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:21.100]   by Google that Congress, attorney generals and the regulatory bodies around the world
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.100]   are investigating.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:26.100]   I'm sorry, Christian, but this is the world you were going to Roku has not asked for one
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:28.940]   additional dollar in financial value from YouTube TV.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:33.940]   We have simply asked Google to stop their any competitive behavior of manipulating user
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:36.540]   search results to their unique financial benefit.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.900]   It is top demanding access to sensitive data.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.140]   No other partner above received today.
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:46.780]   It response Google has just continued its practice, a blatantly leveraging.
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.780]   I'm turning into Hitler.
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:49.780]   I apologize.
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.580]   My poor ears.
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.580]   I'm worried.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:53.580]   I'm monitors on.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.580]   I just lost my hearing.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:56.580]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:57.580]   You're okay.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:58.580]   We're here for you.
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:24:59.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:00.580]   I'm feeling better now.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.580]   Thank you.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:06.580]   Everyone, let's let's send Leo our warmth and love.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.780]   We just spot Libens room.
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:10.420]   It's all asking for.
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.420]   Okay.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:15.700]   I think it's a tough search results in the sun.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.220]   Everybody stops.
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:19.580]   So this is not the way to go with this.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:21.060]   Let's let's stop right now.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:22.060]   I know.
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:24.140]   I know is going so well.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:30.660]   And now we both God wins law by by every show we invoke God wins law.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:32.540]   Thank you, Mr. God.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:36.940]   But but Leo, that statement that you just read though, intonations aside is essentially
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.420]   targeted at Congress, right?
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:42.820]   They're saying, oh, yes, they all and attorneys general go after him, boys.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:43.820]   Go after him.
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:48.060]   But the interesting thing about the way Google is doing this, I think, is smart because they
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:53.460]   are adding the ability to watch and log in with the YouTube TV account, but not to create
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.180]   a YouTube TV account.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:26:00.100]   So the way that they updated it, I think is actually really clever because you can't
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:04.300]   sign up for YouTube TV within that Roku app and within the regular YouTube account.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:10.220]   You can just sign in if you're an existing subscriber, which I don't know if that's going
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:14.780]   to be enough would be enough to convince Congress that they're not doing anything wrong.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:20.700]   But it is a little bit different to say, you know, we're not wanting to quibble over
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:24.060]   who gets more money over signups in this and that, which I think is what some of this
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.060]   comes down to.
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.940]   I think a lot of it really comes down to how content is displayed on the home screen and
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:33.500]   probably user data and some other insidious stuff that both companies are doing, which
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:38.180]   would make its users very unhappy if they knew all the dirty details.
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:42.660]   But the work around, which is that they just basically stuffed in the YouTube TV app into
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:46.700]   the old YouTube app only works if you already have an account.
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:52.340]   So it's similar to the Apple policy of you can't sign up for an account, but you can
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.420]   use it as a viewer.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:55.540]   And I don't know.
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.740]   Whoever's right or wrong, it's a really clever solution.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:58.740]   I have to get them credit.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:03.740]   And pretty much unbeatable because Rok who's not going to take the YouTube app off.
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.140]   That would be I would love to see them do that.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.660]   Honestly, that would be so much fun.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.100]   No, they're not going to do that.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:13.780]   But I would that that would be sort of popcorn thing that would just be delicious to watch,
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:14.780]   honestly.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:16.220]   I'm going to take a little break.
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:19.380]   Christina Warren is here as as well as Christian Warren.
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.900]   It's great to have the both of you.
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:21.900]   So sweet.
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.660]   He is the best baby ever.
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:25.180]   He's such a good baby.
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:26.180]   He's such a good baby.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.180]   Oh my goodness.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.940]   Careful with his head there now.
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:29.940]   No, I am.
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:30.940]   I am.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:31.940]   He's good.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:32.940]   He's a big.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:33.940]   Oh, I got him.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:34.940]   He's so good.
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:35.940]   Yes.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:36.940]   Oh, what a sweet little guy.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.500]   Christina magic.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:45.540]   Also here Owen Thomas, who is baby free senior editor protocol and Owen Thomas, but you are
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.420]   sporting a fantastic shirt.
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:49.380]   If you're not watching video, you're missing.
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:51.780]   That is a nice, nice shirt.
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:53.260]   It's not a Hawaiian shirt.
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.260]   Exactly.
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:55.660]   It's just a shirt shirt.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:56.660]   It's pretty.
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:59.580]   I call it my podcast shirt.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.860]   Oh, so you've worn it before, have you?
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:09.180]   For a live podcast, gosh, I think back in 2019.
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.180]   Not all that.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:12.460]   Remember when we used to do it.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:15.980]   Do you remember like in person recording with other people in the studio?
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:16.980]   You know what?
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:19.900]   My dream, my dream is to get you three in this studio soon.
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:22.460]   I would love that.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.100]   Alex Wilhelm used to come all the time.
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:27.860]   We'd always love to have a new and Alex Wilhelm at TechCrunch.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.420]   Great to have all three of you.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:32.940]   We had a fun week this week on Twitch.
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:38.700]   The highlight reel does not feature me losing my marbles, but it does feature this watch.
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.100]   What's this?
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:42.820]   Ooh, circuitry.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.820]   Wow.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:44.820]   Isn't that nice?
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:45.820]   Wait, it had a same D.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:46.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.820]   There's another tube.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.820]   Where does that go?
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.580]   It's the colon tube.
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:51.580]   The colon tube.
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.380]   Well, I mean, we don't call it that though.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:58.700]   Jason, I'm just looking.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.700]   Previously on Twitch, hands on tech.
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:09.100]   I had the opportunity to get my hands on and play with an amazing camera.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:14.420]   Let me tell you why this camera is $6500 and no, you're probably not going to buy it.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:16.300]   You still want to know what's going on with this camera.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.620]   It's pretty dad-gum cool.
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.620]   Smart tech today.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.980]   Matthew, Gas, and Ellie, and I are finally doing the interview.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:24.060]   We've been promising you.
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:30.020]   Yes, we talked to Jonathan Ooey, who is the principal engineer at Google and the VP of
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.620]   technology at the Thread Group.
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:34.580]   Oh, Mac Break Weekly.
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:39.260]   Hello, Alex Lindsey from Oh My God, Bay the fourth be with you, Rum Slig.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.820]   I was working at ILM.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:44.060]   And occasionally, when you need extras, there's no reason to hire extras at ILM.
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.340]   So I was picked because I think I because it looked like I would probably fit into the
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.580]   given suit.
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:52.820]   On the 10th anniversary, they released a new set of action figures.
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:53.820]   Oh, no.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:54.820]   There it is.
[01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.820]   That's Alex Lindsey.
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:58.980]   So that means you're canon, right?
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.980]   You are canon.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.980]   To it.
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.900]   This is the way.
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.500]   Pay no attention to that Rum Slig.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:10.740]   Our show today brought to you by IT Pro TV.
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:15.540]   If you're considering a career in information technology, or maybe you're already in IT,
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:19.540]   you should know that certifications are critical, not only to get that first job.
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:23.260]   It's a proof to future employers that you have the skills and knowledge for the job.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:28.580]   But because tech is always evolving, certs only last so long, if you're already in IT,
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:32.060]   it's important you stay on top of recertification.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.940]   You got to be aware of updates.
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:38.380]   So you don't have to take the latest exam if you fail to recertify in time.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:42.060]   Certifications are one of the reasons why IT Pro TV can be vital to your career.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:47.060]   IT Pro TV can get you both certified and recertified with all the certs.
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:51.860]   CompTia, Cisco, ISC, Squared, Axolos, Microsoft, and more.
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:53.540]   They'll tell you how long a cert will last.
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:57.740]   They'll give you the tools to complete it, and they'll remind you it's time to renew.
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:01.380]   IT Pro TV gives you a well-rounded educational experience.
[01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:06.860]   You get everything, not just the best videos, but virtual labs so you can set up a Windows
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:11.260]   server and Windows clients in an HTML5 browser.
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:14.020]   You can take the exam before you take the exam.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:18.900]   And the teachers are great, not only experts in the field, but very fun, very entertaining.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:21.220]   They like to call them edutainers.
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:25.180]   You'll never be bored and you'll have fun, but you'll know your stuff and that's what
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.500]   really matters.
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:30.580]   One reviewer said IT Pro TV is hands down the best LMS sites I've used.
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:37.220]   I've ascertained four certs using IT Pro TV, the edutainers are the best in my experience.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:42.020]   They're wonderful reviews for IT Pro TV, go on and on, read them on the website.
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.820]   I think you'll be impressed.
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:44.820]   And I've been there.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:46.300]   I've been to their seven studios in Gainesville.
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.300]   It is amazing.
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:52.100]   They are working Monday through Friday all day to produce new content for you.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:55.860]   5,800 hours of on-demand content now in their library.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:56.860]   It's engaging.
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.860]   It's up to date.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:59.340]   They're always keeping it up to date.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:04.500]   Very important because the exams change, technology changes, products get updated.
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:09.340]   The best part is you could do it all wherever you are from the comfort of your own home.
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:14.940]   On your own schedule, you could stream their courses on your web browser on Chromecast on
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:17.700]   ROKU on Apple TV.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.380]   Of course, they've got iOS and Android apps too.
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.580]   This month, May is Cloud month.
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:26.460]   There are some of the edutainers there, the great people at IT Pro TV.
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.380]   May is Cloud month at IT Pro TV.
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:34.180]   They have training on all three major cloud providers, AWS, Azure, and GCP, the Google
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:35.900]   Cloud platform.
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:41.780]   If you're looking to get certified or to get that first job or to stay certified in your
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:46.060]   existing job or to get new skills so you can get a better job, you're going to love
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.620]   IT Pro TV.
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.180]   And check out IT Pro TV.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:53.380]   If you've got an IT team that you want to keep up to date, they have a great team platform
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.380]   as well.
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:33:03.860]   So itpro.tv/twit, the offer code TWIT30, 30% off all consumer subscriptions as long as
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:05.500]   you stay active.
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:06.700]   So that could be years.
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:09.380]   And I think you'll want to stay active because who wants to stop?
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:15.860]   Itpro.tv/twit, the offer code is TWIT30 for an additional 30% off the lifetime of your
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:17.140]   active subscription.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:22.060]   Itpro TV, build or expand your IT career, enjoy the journey.
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.060]   We love it.
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:24.060]   We love them.
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:30.660]   Itpro TV, IT Pro TV/twit, you see offer code TWIT30.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:36.060]   You know, actually we're talking about tracking so many people contacted us and said, I don't
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.060]   want to be tracked.
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:41.060]   I don't want to have, you know, and we do, we don't track, but we'd log your IP address
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:42.620]   when you download it.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:47.300]   We have a system, I think it works very well to keep you private, but also helps advertisers
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:50.940]   know how much traction they're getting on their advertising.
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:55.900]   We have a third party, there's actually a couple of them, ChartBeat and PodSights, that they
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:34:01.860]   take our logs, our IP addresses, they put a bug on the website of the advertiser and
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:06.100]   then they compare, they never reveal the IP addresses to the advertiser, but they'll say
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.380]   something like 46% of the people who visited that site saw your ad on TWIT.
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:14.900]   And that's the kind of thing, I think in a way that's fairly safe, but even then some
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:16.220]   people don't like it.
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:22.140]   You block origin, blocks, chartable and pod sites, so we always are having to tell people
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:27.620]   you know you got a whitelist, TWIT and chartable and pod sites and megafun which we use for
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.140]   ad insertion.
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:32.060]   So we decided, you know what, we're going to, there are people who don't want to be tracked,
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:35.220]   we're going to do a tracking free version of TWIT and that's when we created the club
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:41.380]   TWIT, which is ad free versus of all our shows because there's no answers, no tracking.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:46.860]   You can turn your filtering back on, your block origin back on.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:50.860]   Seven bucks a month gets you ad free versions of all the shows, audio and video.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:55.180]   But we also have, and it's turned out to be the big, for me the big attraction of this,
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:35:00.220]   we have a special TWIT+ feed with bonus content, but the big thing I love is their Discord,
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.100]   which is really fun.
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:06.300]   We set up stages, we've been doing some offhand shows that we couldn't do otherwise, like
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:12.300]   a Linux show, we did an inside TWIT podcast, Lisa and I, we make those available on the
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.300]   TWIT+ feed.
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:16.500]   The Discord is so much, so much fun.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:22.980]   So if you're interested, I just wanted to give a little plug for club twit, go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:27.580]   It supports us, makes us less dependent on advertising, which these days is probably
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:28.820]   a good thing.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:33.020]   There's no tracking, you don't have to worry about that, your privacy is protected and
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:37.140]   I think there's some good benefits as well, and I love the Discord.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:40.220]   I really do, I think it's so much fun.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:44.900]   Actually, it's a bit of a problem, Leo, because what I've discovered on this particular episode
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:47.300]   of TWIT, this is my first time being on the Discord rule, we're talking, is that it's
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.540]   actually sufficiently funny as to be distracting.
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.300]   Oh, it's totally distracting.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.700]   Yeah, a couple of times I've been like, huh?
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:58.500]   Yeah, so we also do, so, you know, we have an IRC, that's always going to be free, that's
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.500]   continuing to be free.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.660]   We have forums and we have it's masted on and so forth.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:08.540]   The Discord is for the club twit members and they're trying to distract you now, Alex.
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.780]   So it's a lot of fun.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:14.100]   And then we also are, we set up a stage.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.660]   So this is basically their version of Clubhouse.
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:21.340]   In fact, down to the point where you can raise your hand and you can, instead of leave quietly,
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:24.700]   exit quietly, but it's very much Clubhouse.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:29.580]   And so if anybody, I'll open it up now, if anybody has a comment or a suggestion about
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:33.140]   tracking or anything else, just raise your hand.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:37.540]   We'll take some people up on the stage and give you a chance to join the show for, not
[01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:43.500]   forever, but briefly and talk about whatever we're talking about.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:48.580]   Google by the way is going to turn on two factor authentication for everybody automatically.
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:50.860]   I've mixed feelings about this.
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:53.860]   I tell everybody turn on two factor.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:56.300]   You absolutely need it.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:00.380]   But I think some people are going to be confused.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:05.060]   Thursday, the company announced that it will prompt pretty much all users to turn on two
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:07.300]   factor.
[01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:11.700]   If you're already enrolled, it'll ask you to confirm you are who you say you are.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:20.140]   And soon Google plans to automatically have all users turn on two factor automatically.
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:21.420]   It's a good thing, right?
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:22.700]   It's a security issue.
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:24.540]   What's the downside?
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:29.260]   I mean, to me, two factor authentication and password managers are like the bread and butter
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.220]   of reasonable security.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.060]   To me, my first read later was like, great.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.060]   Why is it?
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.060]   But you're hesitant.
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.500]   Well, I mean, banks do it, right?
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.420]   Most financial institutions will text you.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:45.820]   It's not the best way, but at least it is a second factor of authentication.
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:49.780]   When you sign up for a Google account, they usually ask for a secondary email and a phone
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.780]   number.
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:55.260]   Maybe if those things have changed and you are automatically opting people into two factor
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:59.140]   authentication, you could potentially put people in a situation where their second factor
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:01.020]   is advised they no longer have access to.
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:04.940]   And so that would be the only thing that would concern me is that if you're opting people
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:08.860]   into it, you need to make sure that whatever information they've already given you that
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:13.540]   could be for that second factor is still something they have access to because I got my Gmail
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:18.340]   account in 2004 or whatever year it started, right?
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:22.860]   And my phone number ironically is still the same, but most people would not still have
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:25.740]   the same cell phone number that they had in 2004.
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:31.060]   And so if you had a situation like that, my fear is that when you opt people into these
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:32.580]   things, I think it's a good thing.
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:37.260]   I would be more in favor if every new account auto opted in.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:41.220]   I think with the existing accounts, you need to be really careful that people still have
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:43.380]   access to those things.
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:47.380]   Otherwise, you get a people lose access to their accounts.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:52.420]   And as we all have read many horror stories, if you can't get access to a Google account,
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:56.780]   you're basically a SOL because you can't reach somebody at Google customer service to
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:57.980]   give you access.
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:58.980]   This is very good.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:38:59.980]   That we might only concern.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:06.020]   They seem to enforce, I mean, it's because of them that we don't have extended certificates
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:07.900]   that last more than a year.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:11.540]   It's because of them that HTTPS is ubiquitous because they said, well, you're not going
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:13.420]   to be ranked as well if you don't do it.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:19.700]   They have been very quick to kind of strong-arm people into doing what we might agree is the
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.220]   right thing.
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:26.900]   But it grates a little bit that they're just kind of doing it.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:29.620]   Apple's done this though quite a lot.
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:31.020]   They talk about removing things.
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:32.540]   They drop the headphone jack.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:33.780]   They're going wireless.
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:38.220]   They're willing to just make product movements, I think, that we then later on kind of cheer
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:39.220]   on.
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:43.500]   And so I'm just going to go ahead and say if Google hasn't thought through the obvious
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:47.500]   issues that we've just raised with this two-factor authentication push, shame on them.
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:50.060]   But as a general push, I'm in favor of it.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.020]   It's definitely the right thing to do.
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:53.020]   Yes, totally.
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.020]   I agree with Christina.
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:55.020]   There's going to be problems.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.780]   I had a guy today called a radio show.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:59.100]   He's a screenwriter.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.620]   Spent a year writing a screenplay.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.220]   Okay.
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:05.500]   It's somewhat his fault.
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:09.500]   His backup was to email it to himself on his Gmail account, right?
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.060]   So he lost the original.
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.820]   Now he can't get into his Gmail account.
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:15.100]   He lost the original because his laptop was stolen.
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:18.260]   And after his laptop was stolen, he lost access to Gmail account.
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:21.140]   And he's going crazy.
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:24.660]   I can't get Google to reinstate my account.
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.660]   I have no copy of the screenplay.
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.540]   What do I do?
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:29.620]   And there isn't an answer.
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:36.660]   If you don't register that phone number or that secondary email address, you can lose
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:40.980]   a Google account and it's hard to prove that it's your account.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:46.780]   I'm kind of amazed to be still let Google provide no customer service to a service that
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:48.940]   is so core to everyone's digital life.
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:49.940]   Yes, that's what he said.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:50.940]   Well, can I call?
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:51.940]   I said no one.
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:52.940]   Yes.
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:53.940]   It's a free service.
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:54.940]   No one will answer.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:55.940]   He said, yeah, I always get his bots.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:56.940]   He said, yeah.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:01.660]   I just had a call. I said, I went down to the Google offices in Santa Monica and I knocked
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.420]   on the door.
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:07.460]   But nobody, they looked at me, but they wouldn't open it.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:08.980]   So here's a small pro tip.
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:13.820]   So if you look tech-runch office in San Francisco, right by Caltrain, people would occasionally
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:17.340]   just show up and try to get our attention that way.
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.340]   It's creepy.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:19.340]   Don't do it.
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:20.340]   It's creepy.
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.340]   Don't do it.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:22.340]   Don't do it.
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:23.340]   Don't do that.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.940]   At the same time, though, not to absolve Google for having customer service so poor that it's
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.940]   actually kind of a joke slash meme at this point in time.
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:33.500]   But yeah, if you don't have to factor up on your main accounts, do it.
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:36.340]   And if you're not using a password manager, get on that.
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:40.100]   Because if you don't do this, you're just not taking your own security seriously.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:43.340]   And when you call the show, he will gently mock you in front of lots of people.
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:48.180]   I didn't mock him, but I have to admit, I kind of thought maybe that this was a plot
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:52.700]   point in the screenplay and he was just checking to make sure he'd written it up right.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:55.380]   Honestly, it felt odd.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:59.580]   Sometimes it wasn't quite right.
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:04.900]   I think we need to remember the flip side of companies not taking privacy seriously.
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:09.620]   One incident very famously was Yahoo got hacked.
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.420]   One billion accounts.
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:17.380]   The security officials were all saying, you have to reset everyone's password.
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:25.340]   And Yahoo refused to do it because they were worried that too many users would delete their
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:31.980]   accounts, refuse to stop logging in because they couldn't figure out how to remember the
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:32.980]   new password.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:33.980]   Here's a perfect example.
[01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:39.660]   Twitter sets up a tip jar as a way to reward people you follow that you think would be
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:42.380]   good.
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:48.140]   They used PayPal and apparently they designed it in such a way that the pays could figure
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:51.220]   out who the payers were.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:55.580]   Like by name.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:57.260]   It's securities hard.
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:58.260]   I guess.
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:04.580]   I think the biggest thing on two dings on Twitter, one is that they didn't think about
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:10.380]   this, which suggests to me that they didn't even test it internally adequately to notice
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.700]   that.
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.780]   And it's kind of more of a PayPal issue.
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.100]   PayPal was designed around like, hey, I pay you money.
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:19.020]   You send me some person to person.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:24.060]   And to send you the goods you bought, I need your address.
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:30.900]   So Twitter probably should have worked with PayPal to make sure that everything was set
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:37.140]   to person to person payments, which don't reveal the address.
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:39.980]   But it's just inadequate testing.
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:49.260]   Also I think Twitter was trying to avoid direct responsibility or involvement in the transaction.
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:52.140]   So they just used a bunch of third party services.
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:59.980]   And when you outsource everything like that, you can't control little nuances of the user
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:03.020]   interface or data leakage.
[01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:04.020]   Right.
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:07.700]   What do you think about the idea of a tip jar on Twitter?
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:10.060]   Is that a side?
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:12.980]   I don't love it.
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:13.980]   What's wrong with it?
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:14.980]   Why, Ellen?
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:26.780]   I think it just will encourage more performative, stunting, catering to catering to the crowd.
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:29.780]   It's sort of the problem with the whole sub-stack universe.
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:32.500]   The sub-stack is not going to save journalism.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:38.460]   It's going to encourage a certain kind of opinion writing that is interesting.
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:39.460]   Well, it's interesting.
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:40.460]   That is already popular.
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:41.940]   Because Twitter is really doubling down.
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:44.540]   They bought a sub-stack clone called review.js.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:45.540]   Right?
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:48.940]   Which actually existed before sub-stack, I should point out.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:49.940]   Okay.
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:50.940]   Review predated them by.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:51.940]   The other way around.
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:53.900]   Sub-stack copied them.
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:58.180]   They just bought Scroll, which is a really interesting service.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:01.980]   I was thinking Scroll is in a number of businesses, but the service I'm aware of.
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:07.820]   You pay a monthly subscription fee and they pay some of the journals you visit so that
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:10.220]   you don't have to see ads.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.220]   Love that.
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:14.500]   One thing I'm sad about, let me just check.
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:15.500]   Nuzzle.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:22.180]   And they, so Scroll bought Nuzzle, Jonathan Abrams news company, which scraped my Twitter
[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:23.460]   feed and gave me news.
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:24.460]   I just went to Nuzzle.
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:26.220]   It's been this way all day.
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:27.980]   I think they've already turned it off.
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:29.820]   They said they were going to.
[01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:31.580]   God, that's depressed.
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:35.380]   They'd even bother putting up a sorry Nuzzles discontinued.
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.060]   I'm getting no connection.
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.060]   I can't get online.
[01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:39.060]   No, it doesn't exist.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:40.060]   Sorry.
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:41.060]   Go away.
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:42.060]   Is this me?
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.060]   Is this only me that's getting this?
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:46.060]   No, I think they, I think they said that it was going to shut down.
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:47.060]   Just pull the plug.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:48.060]   Totally.
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:50.220]   Which is a shame because I liked Nuzzle a lot.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:56.100]   It reminded me a lot of ThinkUp, which was a Neil Dash and Gina Tripiani's service, which
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:59.260]   then Twitter changed their API and wouldn't really work anymore.
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.420]   But so they had to shut it down.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:05.540]   But yeah, I mean, if you were somebody who followed a lot of people and used Twitter
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:09.020]   for certain things, like Nuzzle was great because you would get all the links people
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:12.580]   shared and it would be ordered based on how many people shared that link.
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:13.580]   So useful.
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:17.180]   And it was really useful, really niche to be obviously.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.060]   But a lot of, obviously we all used it.
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:20.060]   So it must have been.
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.060]   No, I know.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:22.060]   I mean, obviously.
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:23.060]   I'm a journalist, I guess, right?
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:24.060]   I agree.
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:26.060]   Like, I mean, it would be smart for Twitter to productize this themselves.
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:28.460]   One of the things Nuzzle had.
[01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:31.420]   And one of the things I think Twitter might be, and they said they were going to incorporate
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.420]   parts of Nuzzle.
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.540]   By the way, I just went to Nuzzle.com and I got this.
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:37.940]   Nuzzle.com is part free courtesy of GoDaddy.
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:40.300]   That's a pretty bad sign.
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:44.020]   I think they're gone without a word without even say goodbye.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:46.620]   It's just like, we're not going to pay for this.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.620]   We're not going to renew it.
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:52.740]   My main thought on this is never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:53.740]   by an imamidance.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:47:00.820]   I'm not talking that something Jonathan Abrams belt is kind of buggy and, you know, like
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:01.820]   not.
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:02.820]   Whoo!
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:03.820]   That's mean.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.700]   Scroll had owned it for two, three years now.
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.780]   So you can't blame Jonathan.
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:09.700]   He created Friendster.
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:15.060]   The scroll kind of blamed the original architecture and said that it just couldn't be updated.
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.820]   Yeah, okay.
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:22.020]   But Nuzzle didn't have a newsletter feature that you could actually have a Nuzzle newsletter
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.020]   based on what you find.
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:24.740]   I don't know if anybody used it.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:25.740]   But I didn't use that.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:26.740]   But a lot of people did.
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:29.340]   I used to hate those links, to be honest.
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:31.780]   The people would, you know, would auto tweet out their Nuzzle newsletter.
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:32.780]   Right.
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:34.740]   But I did enjoy my daily digest.
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:35.740]   Right.
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:37.220]   Yeah, I never used the newsletter either.
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:38.220]   But you could.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:41.700]   And I'm wondering, I think Twitter is getting into this newsletter business in some way.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:43.500]   That's part of the reason they bought Scroll.
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:44.980]   Leo, I think you're dead on.
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:45.980]   Yeah, I know.
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:48.260]   But the button is a little bit more interesting than that because when we think about a
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:52.220]   contract, I mean, Owen's comments aside about kind of what types of writers it's attracting.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:57.620]   I mean, it's kind of mono feature, but what Twitter is building with spaces, which is
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:01.860]   their kind of like clubhousey type thing with review, a way to write longer from content
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:05.500]   on the site and scroll away to pay for content.
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:10.820]   They're building a set of tools for writers where writers already live and have their
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:11.820]   key social.
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:12.820]   That's a good point.
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:13.820]   They're already that.
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:14.820]   I get that.
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:16.540]   To promote it to say I just wrote this.
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:17.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:18.540]   It's interesting.
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:21.420]   And I haven't seen a lot of discussion on this.
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.660]   Maybe it's happened, but I haven't seen a lot of discussion.
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:27.780]   Maybe they will do what they've done many times in the past, both Twitter and Facebook
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:28.860]   have done this in the past.
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:34.500]   But, you know, SubSAC has a direct Twitter integration where you can, when you sign up
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:37.620]   for a SubSAC account and you subscribe to someone's account, you know, and it's not
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:41.260]   even so much you creating the SubSAC, but like you're going to read content, you can
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:45.540]   find people that you follow on Twitter who also have SubSACs and automatically subscribe
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:47.180]   to their SubSACs.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.540]   I have a SubSAC that I haven't used.
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:52.380]   My domain is Christina.subSAC.com.
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:54.540]   I also have one I've never used.
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:55.540]   Yep.
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:49:01.860]   But because of that feature, I get, you know, dozens of subscribers a week from the Twitter
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:03.100]   integration.
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:06.620]   The interesting thing there is that if I were to use, and I've been twin around with
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:12.300]   wanting to do a newsletter for a long time, the appeal of SubSAC would be the network,
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:13.300]   right?
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:14.300]   And the platform effect.
[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:19.140]   But obviously Twitter is where I have a lot of followers and where it would be useful,
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:20.900]   maybe think about using some of the reviews.
[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:24.500]   It would be interesting to think about if Twitter really does take this seriously, like
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:29.300]   do they cut off SubSACs access, you know, the way that they did with Meerkat back in
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:33.500]   the day, you know, when they had the Periscope, like do they cut off that access for people
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.740]   to be able to discover, you know, people they want to follow?
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:37.740]   They could.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:41.260]   That was just so any competitive, but it's probably not legal, right?
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:43.260]   No, they did.
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:49.020]   But first, Instagram did it with Twitter because you used to be able to find an auto follow
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:54.540]   people on Instagram who, if you had a Twitter connection and then Facebook cut that off.
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:59.700]   And then Twitter did it with Meerkat when Meerkat and Periscope launched because you
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:05.300]   could again discover people to follow on Meerkat through Twitter connections and Twitter cut
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:07.380]   that off.
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:10.220]   So there's precedent there for them to do it.
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:12.940]   I hope they wouldn't, but they certainly could.
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:17.100]   And to Alex's point, since this is where writers live, if you're talking about having
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:21.380]   the mechanism to tip, having the mechanism to charge using scroll, having the ability
[01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:27.700]   to do newsletters, you know, you conceivably having spaces where you could maybe even possibly
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:32.380]   have that in some particular way, you know, siloed if they wanted to to say only people,
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:34.940]   you know, a certain thing can be in this group.
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:37.900]   They don't have that feature yet, but there's something to say that they couldn't productize
[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:38.900]   that.
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:43.700]   So that could be a really compelling offering that is different and it's kind of a combination,
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:47.620]   like not different, but it's a combination of what a lot of other things do and that
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.140]   could go a long way.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:51.460]   Yeah, we're talking about platform risk.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:53.420]   I mean, this entire show has been about platform risk.
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:57.100]   I mean, like the Roku YouTube thing is about platforms.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:59.780]   The Apple Epic thing is about platforms.
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:03.900]   This Twitter discussion is about platforms and kind of who owns and controls them.
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:07.740]   And you know, going back to Owens earlier a point about trying to thread the needle between
[01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:12.180]   realizing that the world has changed in our old views of free speech, probably don't
[01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:16.180]   perfectly fit the modern reality and also not compelling corporate speech through various
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.180]   things.
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:21.300]   I mean, gosh darn, I mean, we could really use a smart person out there helping put this
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.300]   all together.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:26.860]   But I feel like we don't have a good discourse around this because people are still kind of
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:27.860]   not waking up.
[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:28.860]   I hate that for a period.
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:33.740]   But like coming to grips with the power of platforms in the modern internet era and what
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:34.740]   they mean.
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:40.860]   I don't have the solutions to these problems, but if Twitter does deprecate other companies,
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:44.260]   neat products, integrations in favor of their own, I'll be peeved.
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.620]   You know, but I can't go anywhere.
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:47.380]   I'm not going to lose my Twitter followers.
[01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:49.380]   That's the point, right?
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.620]   They can get away with it.
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:55.700]   There's a whole history here and sorry, Alex and I have this joke.
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:58.380]   This is hitting the Owen history button.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:01.700]   But Facebook actually pulled this on Twitter very early on.
[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:06.260]   Twitter tried to develop a system where you could find your Facebook friends who had Twitter
[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:09.700]   accounts and Facebook shut that down.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.940]   So fast forward a few years.
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:15.540]   Instagram had a tight integration with Twitter.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:18.060]   That's what I said.
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:21.540]   Which is why Instagram accounts look.
[01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:28.660]   And then, you know, and then there was Vine, you know, which which also got kneecapped.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:32.580]   Be cat by Facebook as soon as as soon as Twitter bought it.
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:34.180]   Is that what happened to Vine?
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.460]   Is that it wasn't a mismanagement on Twitter's part?
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:39.140]   Is that Facebook killed it in effect by Blon?
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:43.500]   Well, you know, it was definitely mismanagement on on Twitter's part.
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:47.460]   But the fact that you, you know, yeah, it was a bunch of Facebook friends.
[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:52.220]   Twitter pissed off all the Vine creators who came to Twitter and said, Hey, pay us.
[01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:54.780]   And Twitter said, No, that was right.
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:58.260]   You also had a yeah.
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:00.260]   And yeah, so you had that instance.
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.260]   I'm trying to think there's another one.
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.580]   Oh, this was one.
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:06.180]   Remember Ping Apple's Ping music service?
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:07.180]   Yeah.
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:12.700]   So it launched for like two days and it had Facebook integration and you could follow people
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:13.700]   that were Facebook friends.
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.980]   You could connect it with Ping and follow people.
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:20.900]   And then Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg had a fight and all of a sudden Ping lost Facebook
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:21.900]   support.
[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:22.900]   Mm hmm.
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:23.900]   Oh.
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.460]   And that's the kiss of death for a social network.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:27.460]   And it was.
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:31.460]   And that was one of the reasons, one of the many reasons why Ping died honestly was that
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:34.900]   how are you going to discover and find anybody when you have no social graph interaction.
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:37.700]   So those things to Alex's point are really powerful.
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:42.140]   And to Owen's point, yeah, we've mentioned this, this has happened many times in the past,
[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:44.660]   but it is one of those, those interesting things.
[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:48.300]   Like I think you have to be careful if you're a company and you become too reliant on someone
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.300]   else.
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:52.780]   So to be clear, I don't think sub-sac is like, I don't think sub-sac is going to be hurting
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.700]   if people don't have the ability to follow like sub-sac themselves.
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:59.420]   I don't think we'll be hurting if they lost the Twitter integration.
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:05.660]   That said, I do think sub-sac writers would be hurt if people wouldn't be able to do that.
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:09.980]   And to be even more clear, I don't think sub-sac cares about that.
[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:14.300]   Like I don't think that sub-sac's concern, but sub-sac writers who have a big Twitter
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:18.660]   platform, that could be the sort of thing that for me, I'd be like, well, if that feature
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:25.580]   goes away and my biggest audience is on Twitter, I might as well use the Twitter newsletter
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:26.580]   service.
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:32.940]   I mean, sub-sac has said that one of the factors they use to decide whether to pay a writer
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:39.060]   in advance to start writing on sub-sac is the size of their social media following.
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:41.060]   Oh, of course it is, of course it is.
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:44.780]   But I just mean in terms of like having that integration there, like I don't think sub-sac
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:50.100]   would worry if people could follow directly from or subscribe directly from the service
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.860]   when they sign up for a reader account.
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:52.860]   So.
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:56.340]   Because if you've got a big enough of a brand, like if Leo wanted to start a newsletter,
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:55:01.380]   whether or not there was any integration there, he's got his mass following regardless of
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:03.500]   how easy it is to sign up in their app.
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:04.860]   Well now you got me intrigued.
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:11.420]   So I have half a million followers, 531,000 followers on Twitter, 250,000 of which are
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:14.260]   bots, but let's not talk about that.
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:15.260]   Could I make money?
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:18.180]   Can I go to sub-sac and say, hey, I got a half a million followers.
[01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:19.180]   Give me money.
[01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:20.180]   Yep.
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:21.180]   Probably.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.180]   Really?
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:23.180]   I think they would.
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:24.180]   I mean, think about it.
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:25.180]   I don't know.
[01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:26.180]   I'm talking about money.
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.180]   We're talking here.
[01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:28.180]   A couple hundred K.
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:29.180]   Really?
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.180]   I mean, based on how much they paid.
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:31.180]   Yeah.
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.180]   I mean, some sub-sac pro advances are relatively material.
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:35.380]   You know, when they make money on those, I mean, don't they make money on, I'm trying
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:39.260]   to think of some people that they gave, who do they give, oh, and they gave somebody
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:42.660]   a quarter of a million dollars, but they made half a million dollars in subscriptions.
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:43.660]   Iglesias.
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:44.660]   Magic Laces.
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:46.660]   The box.
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:50.460]   So that's because he has a big file of following because he was a founder of Vox.
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:51.460]   Yeah.
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:52.460]   Yeah.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:53.460]   And he had a blog before Vox.
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:56.660]   He would have been smart not to have taken the deal, in fact.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:57.660]   Yes.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:55:59.660]   All this stuff that we're talking about.
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:00.660]   It's a hedge.
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:01.660]   Twitter.
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:05.060]   All the stuff we're talking about, Twitter and its media efforts and sub-stack and subscriptions.
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:08.540]   And even, I mean, honestly, clubbed to it, Leo, to what you're currently working on,
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:13.900]   to me is trying to build a better economic foundation under what I, what people call
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:15.260]   content creation, which I despise.
[01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:19.820]   I would say creative work through a particular medium, but like writing, podcast, et cetera,
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:23.740]   it's trying to get more kind of consumer dollars into it to make it a bit more sustainable
[01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:27.300]   and just more viable.
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:31.180]   And I got to say as someone who has since been his entire professional life writing for
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:33.020]   a living, I'm stoked.
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:35.100]   You know, I'm optimistic about a lot of this stuff.
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:37.120]   Not all of it's working out great so far.
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:38.120]   There are problems here and there.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.580]   Like at least Twitter is trying to make something that's going to put a couple of dollars into
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:42.580]   journalism.
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:45.180]   At least sub-stack is trying to cool new, newish model.
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:49.300]   You know, I mean, I'm bullish and I know Owen's going to tell me this happened in '94.
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:54.900]   But like, you know, it still makes my heart warm to some degree to feel oddly valued by
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:58.180]   technology companies instead of like a con.
[01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:04.060]   Take this opportunity and announce the launch of my Twitch streaming channel.
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:06.860]   I'd be playing Valheim till the cows come home.
[01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:08.800]   See, I even got the cool hat.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:12.280]   Yeah, it's very exciting.
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.280]   Everybody can join me while I sail around in a boat.
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.280]   What is Valheim?
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.160]   What kind is this?
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.760]   It's Minecraft for Vikings.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.240]   It's called Valheim.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:24.680]   It's great fun.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:30.440]   I just bought Crusader Kings 3 and I understand it about as well as I understand it so that
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:31.440]   explanation.
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:42.420]   You mind, you build, you fight creeps and then you do sailing, a lot of sailing because the
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:44.700]   distances are vast.
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:50.820]   And I think in this sail I run into a troll at some point.
[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.500]   Almost get my boat destroyed.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:53.500]   Metaphorical troll or?
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:54.500]   No, in giant blue.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:58:01.500]   I'm actually a troll.
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:07.500]   A 20 foot tall troll wielding a tree trunk as a weapon.
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:11.500]   Someone called this game Cyberpunk 2077 set in 1495.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:13.500]   That's another funny set.
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.500]   I've ever read.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:15.500]   That's brilliant.
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:16.500]   That's brilliant.
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:17.500]   That's brilliant.
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:19.500]   It's not as exciting as Cyberpunk.
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.500]   It really isn't.
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:21.500]   It's an open world.
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:22.500]   I guess you could say that for it.
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:23.500]   A lot of sailors.
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:25.500]   The blue to purple there is fantastic.
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:26.500]   Where do you see the sunset?
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:29.500]   Where do you see the sunset?
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:31.500]   The golden hour is wonderful.
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:37.500]   Then you have a little house that I wander around and make things and travel around.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.500]   There's different biomes.
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:39.500]   There's the woods.
[01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:40.500]   Isn't that pretty?
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:41.500]   I'm going to do this.
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:42.500]   I'm going to get home.
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:44.500]   I'm going to actually download this.
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:45.500]   It's 20 bucks.
[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:47.500]   It's in pre-release.
[01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:49.500]   And already it's the best game I ever played.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:52.500]   So I think it's the next Minecraft, to be honest.
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.500]   Can you make it all the way to Nova Scotia?
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:59:01.500]   If you have enough food in your larder, you can go as far.
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:03.500]   The world is giant.
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:04.500]   It's really big.
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:07.500]   It's a giant globe and I've only explored a small fraction of it.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.500]   I love technology, Leo.
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:15.500]   I'm literally watching a replay of your Twitch while talking to you about it on a podcast
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:18.900]   after discussing media relations between platform companies, after discussing the importance of
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:19.900]   free speed.
[01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:20.900]   Later.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:21.900]   Technology is so great.
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.580]   Later we'll make a ham sandwich together.
[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:24.580]   It's great.
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:25.580]   God, I love it.
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:27.220]   Sudo make me a ham sandwich.
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:34.660]   We're going to take a little break so that I can pay for my Valheim stream.
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:38.500]   But then it's a speed round because we have like a thousand stories in five minutes left.
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:43.340]   So we're going to give you a bunch of stories and I want your reactions.
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:45.140]   Just the snap judgment.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:49.860]   It'll be snap judgment from Alex Wilhelm, Owen Thomas, and Christina Warren.
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:50.860]   What the hell?
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:51.860]   Owen's turn.
[01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:53.780]   Owen's the dog and then there's a.
[01:59:53.780 --> 02:00:02.620]   Oh, I showed a I think I think it was Valheim that said Owen to another another land.
[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:04.300]   He's gone now forever.
[02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:07.020]   I showed a brought to you by podium.
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:12.260]   This is the greatest thing for the small business, the retail establishment at Dennis
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:19.740]   office because it turns out your customers want to talk to you via text message.
[02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:21.260]   They really do trust me.
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:22.260]   That's how I want to talk to you.
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:24.980]   It's how everybody does in the 90s.
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:26.300]   You had to have an email address, right?
[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:29.660]   Or you weren't a business by the 2000s.
[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:31.220]   You had a website, right?
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:35.300]   In 2010, you had to have a Twitter account of social media presence, a Facebook page.
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:41.740]   I'm telling you in 2021, your business needs to be texting and that's why you need podium.
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:43.860]   It makes it easy.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:44.860]   It's a message.
[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:47.700]   Think of it as a messaging platform to power your business.
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:52.180]   It helps you reach your customers in a way they really want to be reached.
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:55.540]   98% of text messages get opened.
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:58.460]   Email the open rate is about 20%.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:00.500]   People aren't reading your emails.
[02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:02.620]   They will read your texts.
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:06.940]   Business messaging with podium is not just to say hello.
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:08.700]   You can ask for reviews.
[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:09.780]   You can collect payments.
[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:16.740]   You can communicate with customers, capture leads, make appointments all from one single
[02:01:16.740 --> 02:01:20.260]   inbox that your staff will love because it comes into their text messages.
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:26.340]   Makes it very easy for them and you to adapt to changing customer expectations.
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:30.460]   These days, if I find out a business context, I'm just going to do that.
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:31.460]   I'm not going to call them.
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:34.580]   If I want to make it a point-moment, I text them.
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:37.260]   When I was so happy, I went to the dentist.
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:39.260]   He said, "Okay, how'd you like that?"
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:41.260]   Put us, give us a review.
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.860]   As I was going to my car, that made it so much easier for me.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:47.060]   I clicked the link and I give them a review with podium reviews.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:49.820]   You can text customers to leave an online review.
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:51.620]   This is huge for your business.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:53.540]   It improves your search rankings.
[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:54.940]   It generates traffic.
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:58.660]   Dr. Wyatt, he's at South Tampa family and cosmetic dentistry.
[02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:02.500]   He said, "They collected nearly 1,200 reviews."
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:05.660]   By the way, there must be a good dentistry averaging 4.9 stars.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:10.260]   He said, "The number of walk-ins as a result of our reviews has skyrocketed.
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:13.340]   We're seeing 200 new patients a month."
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:15.540]   Thanks to podium.
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:17.740]   The Bridal Collection uses podium for payments.
[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:23.460]   They processed over $200,000 in no-contact payments, which Lynn loves.
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:24.460]   She's the owner.
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:25.460]   She said, "We don't have to take credit cards in the store.
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:26.660]   We can just do it completely remotely.
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:30.620]   It's been a godsend for us during COVID-19."
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:31.620]   It just works.
[02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:33.980]   You get podium reviews, podium web chats.
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:35.780]   You can put that on your website.
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:39.660]   Let's visit our text with your team right from your homepage.
[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:40.900]   There's video chat.
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:44.260]   You can actually see your customers, meet with them.
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:47.500]   You get paid fast over text with podium payments.
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:52.260]   podium inbox brings it all together, keeps leads warm, respond to feedback.
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:53.260]   Your staff will love it.
[02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:54.260]   It's easy.
[02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:55.260]   It's all in one place.
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:57.860]   You can get your business onboarded with podium within 24 hours.
[02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:03.140]   They've got a full team in place to answer questions, to walk you through everything.
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:07.340]   America's Car Mart uses podium TJ, who's in charge of the digital experience there.
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:11.780]   They collected 21,000 leads through the web chat on their webpage.
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:16.140]   TJ said, "Before podium, we had to contact us for them."
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:19.220]   Because it was so hard to use, it could have been days before anybody got back to that
[02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:20.220]   customer.
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:22.460]   Now with podium, our staff loves it.
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:24.700]   Our response time's cut down in minutes.
[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:25.940]   podium is so cool.
[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:29.980]   You probably already, there's an ice cream shop in town that uses it.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:30.980]   They send me coupons.
[02:03:30.980 --> 02:03:32.820]   I just go, "Damn you.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:36.460]   I'm podium."
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:37.660]   But it always works.
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:38.660]   It always works.
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:41.700]   Find out how podium can help your business reach more customers.

[02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:49.860]   Check out the demo there.
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:51.180]   I think you'll understand.
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.740]   It's hard for me to describe because it does so many things.
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:57.780]   But I think once you see it, how easy it is to use, and you'll think of 100 ways you
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:01.260]   want to start using this with your customers and deck clients.
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:04.100]   podium.com/twit.
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:07.300]   Thank you, podium, for your support of this weekend tech.
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:09.020]   I have stories about podium.
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:10.740]   Do you know who we're talking about?
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:11.740]   Yeah.
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:12.740]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:15.780]   So podiums, this is my point about technology being everything because podium is a company
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:20.580]   that I've covered for a long time because they're one of the second or third generation
[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:24.740]   of Utah-based tech companies that have done incredibly well.
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:26.780]   They're worth like one and a half billion now.
[02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:27.780]   You're kidding me.
[02:04:27.780 --> 02:04:28.780]   Wow.
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:30.780]   They're a unicorn now.
[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:31.780]   They've raised a bunch of money.
[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:33.700]   They've grown really, really quickly.
[02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:39.140]   And it's so fun to see companies that are at the forefront of how consumer interactions
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:43.860]   work, advertising on Twit that a couple of years ago were relatively unknown startups
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:45.740]   out of an ecosystem that wasn't that respected.
[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:50.820]   Even though now Utah is actually a pretty big startup hub, just goes to show how much
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:51.820]   stuff changes.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:52.820]   Yeah.
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:57.740]   Well, it's funny because for a while, if everybody who advertised on Twit got bought by Amazon,
[02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:01.340]   I think Jeff Bezos is watching the show.
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:07.100]   I'm not saying that's going to happen to you, podium, but I mean ring, pill pack, audible,
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:10.700]   Amazon just kept buying all of our advertisers up.
[02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:13.780]   Anyway, thank you, podium for supporting Twit.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.700]   All right, quick IBM.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:22.180]   We were talking about this before the show creates its first two nanometer chip.
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:27.020]   But I think it's important to understand that this measurement no longer means what it used
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:28.020]   to be.
[02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:31.220]   Intel's been stuck at 10 nanometers for 100 years.
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:32.740]   They couldn't get down to seven.
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:35.380]   I think they're going to win the next couple of years.
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:40.940]   Apple's already through TSMC, the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing company.
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:43.580]   Apple's already getting down to five nanometers.
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:48.820]   But because of 3D design, what a nanometer, the size of the trace doesn't mean the same
[02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:50.380]   as it used to.
[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:53.940]   So when they say five nanometers, they're saying five nanometer equivalent because they
[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:55.340]   might be triple stacked.
[02:05:55.340 --> 02:06:00.420]   I think a non-tech, yeah, they had an image on a non-tech that will explain this.
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:02.700]   These transistors are now stacked.
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:07.100]   So the distance between transmitters, transistors, isn't the only way to measure it.
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:11.220]   A better way to measure it is transistor densities.
[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:12.980]   So let's use that.
[02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:20.100]   So Intel with their 10 nanometer process has about 100 trillion, what is it?
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:25.100]   100 million transmitters per square millimeter.
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:26.100]   That's the thing.
[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:28.340]   100 per million transistors per...
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:30.940]   By the way, that's a lot of freaking transistors.
[02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:35.540]   A square millimeter is the size of a head of a pin practically.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:39.980]   But this new process that IBM tripled that.
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:45.340]   333 million transistors per square millimeter.
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:51.060]   That's beating double TSMC's five nanometer.
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:53.700]   Triple Intel's 10 nanometer.
[02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:57.060]   Samsung's 10 nanometers, only 50 million.
[02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:00.140]   So this is a huge breakthrough.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.460]   Good article on a non-tech.
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:11.540]   If you're curious about all this, it's obviously something hugely significant because Moore's
[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:16.780]   law, which we've continually thought we were coming up against, has been cracked once again.
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:20.060]   I mean, this is really a big deal.
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:26.860]   This is extreme ultraviolet, EUV technology.
[02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:29.180]   If you want to say you could say something other, we'll move on.
[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:33.700]   No, I'm torn about this because I feel like IBM has been discussing...
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:36.180]   Moore should thrust that to buy.
[02:07:36.180 --> 02:07:37.180]   Yeah.
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:38.180]   Well, that.
[02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:43.460]   But also IBM brought out Watson and claimed that they had cracked business-ready AI and
[02:07:43.460 --> 02:07:45.060]   that wasn't really the case.
[02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:49.780]   And after that, I've been skeptical of all things IBM, but if they have pulled this off,
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:53.180]   a major kudos to one of the oldest companies in technology.
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:55.700]   I would love to see their renaissance if that's...
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:08:01.100]   They do this in Albany and Albany, New York.
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:03.340]   I think there are some areas you're right.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:07.700]   Watson's a really good example of hype over hyped technology.
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:12.780]   But remember, we can thank IBM for the amazing hard drive densities, the growth in smart
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:15.460]   power density we've seen over the last few years.
[02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:18.580]   They are still doing some very important research.
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:21.620]   I feel like this is probably the real deal.
[02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:22.620]   And what you're going to...
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:23.620]   It'll trickle down.
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:25.500]   You'll see TSMC do it and others.
[02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:27.260]   And it means you're M1 chip.
[02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:31.500]   You know, when we get to the M5, it might have quadrillion transistors and that thing.
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:32.500]   I mean, it's just...
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:37.260]   Just saying M5 later makes me so excited because I still really want an M1 MacBook.
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:38.540]   And so you're talking about that far ahead.
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:39.540]   Oh, my Lord.
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:40.540]   Yeah.
[02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:43.140]   It's just IBM, all the companies are doing this.
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:44.860]   And it's basically FinFET technology.
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:47.580]   Let's just stack these transistors.
[02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:52.020]   Speaking of Watson, have you heard about Dr. Phil?
[02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:54.260]   That was terrible.
[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:56.060]   All right.
[02:08:56.060 --> 02:08:57.620]   Tell me about Dr. Phil.
[02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:08.260]   Dr. F-I-L-L is a crossword puzzle bought that has, for the first time, yes, that is,
[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:11.780]   for the first time ever beaten humans.
[02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:17.820]   They won the big crossword puzzle tournament with a thousand humans.
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:21.940]   It's the first time you would think that given that computers can now beat world chess
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:27.860]   champions, can beat, can actually win it go, which is an even harder game, that crossword
[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:31.580]   puzzles would be pretty easy.
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:37.860]   But in fact, they're not because, yes, you can have every answer in your database, Mr.
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:38.980]   Computer.
[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:40.820]   But they clues, as you know.
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:41.820]   Anybody do crosswords?
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:42.820]   I do.
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:43.820]   I love this one.
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:44.820]   I do.
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:45.820]   Yeah.
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:46.820]   I do.
[02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:47.820]   The clues are often just phrased differently enough to get their punny.
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:53.380]   And then sometimes you'll have the reverse thing where it'll be the same answer, but
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:56.220]   it'll be phrased just differently week to week.
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:59.660]   And if you play a lot of crossword puzzles, you'll recognize the same clues over and over
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:00.660]   again.
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:02.660]   But I could see how that would trip up in the AI.
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:03.660]   Yeah.
[02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:06.260]   Because if it's just looking for an exact match, then it's not going to know that.
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:09.700]   So you need to infer a lot of information from the clue.
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:10.700]   So here's the clue.
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:15.980]   That's actually the most impressive factor in the potency of a poppy product.
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:18.660]   And the answer was opium density.
[02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:25.420]   Now that's actually a very sophisticated, very human kind of joke that would make a human
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:26.420]   laugh.
[02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:30.100]   It's almost like, you know, you can't, you don't expect an AI to have a sense of humor,
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:35.700]   but you kind of need, you kind of need to have a sense of humor to solve these things.
[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:41.980]   So Dr. Phil, now the, I guess, world crossword champion.
[02:10:41.980 --> 02:10:43.500]   I knew this was coming.
[02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:49.100]   I knew this was coming because they made a bot or they used AI to beat Starcraft 2, essentially.
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:50.580]   Oh, that was hard.
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:51.580]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:55.300]   It was as a bronze leaguer in Starcraft 2.
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:59.300]   And if you know the ranking, I thought you were a Dota 2 guy.
[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:00.300]   League of Legends.
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:03.780]   And to be clear, I was actually, I was gold ranked in Starcraft 2 back in the day, but I
[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:07.700]   mean, like, when, when a ask can get that's innovative.
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:08.780]   Is that a humble right?
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:09.780]   I'm a witch, Christy.
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:10.780]   Okay.
[02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:11.780]   What?
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:12.780]   I'm an I'm also nerd.
[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:13.780]   I do.
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:14.780]   I'm just still, I'm just saying.
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:16.940]   Hey, we're, Christina, I do crossword puzzles.
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:17.940]   How nerdy can you get?
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:18.940]   Yeah.
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:19.940]   No, no, no, no, I do.
[02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:23.060]   My wife and I pay the New York Times for the crossword puzzles.
[02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:24.060]   We do them together.
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:25.060]   How dorky is that?
[02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:27.060]   That, you know, at least, and I do the same thing.
[02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:28.060]   That's real.
[02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:29.060]   Yeah, it's sort of a great.
[02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:30.060]   I love it.
[02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:31.060]   Isn't it fun?
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:32.060]   Yes, it is.
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:33.060]   It's romantic.
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:34.060]   You're solving with your spouse.
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:35.580]   What's better than that?
[02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:40.580]   No, but once they figured out Starcraft 2, to me, I mean, it's just a dominant effect
[02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:44.620]   from that point of time because go is complex, but to me, it doesn't have guns and therefore
[02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:47.060]   it can't be quite as cool or complex as Starcraft 2.
[02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:51.020]   So that to me was the pinnacle of the movement towards computers, being that's everything.
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:56.100]   So, by the way, I think we just had the first bot visit to our IRC channel.
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:12:00.420]   I can't imagine any other excuse for somebody typing in the IRC channel.
[02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:04.580]   Watch the voice on Monday for live playoffs on NBC.
[02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:06.340]   What the hell?
[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:07.340]   Man wrong audience.
[02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:08.340]   Speak about ad targeting.
[02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:14.740]   Yeah, I was going to say it's the voice going around IRC channels and posting plugs.
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:15.740]   That is bizarre.
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:16.740]   Oh my God, I would love that.
[02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:17.820]   That would be an amazing story.
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:23.580]   I would love to investigate that and find out if somebody, the NBC hire, like some agency
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:24.580]   is going around.
[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:28.820]   IRC is the future of social.
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:32.060]   No, no, no.
[02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:34.580]   Hey, I loved your protocol piece.
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:38.740]   By the way, I want to give it a plug going digging in the dust.
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:43.940]   Sorry, Alex, of a well and Yahoo's lost internet empires.
[02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:46.180]   They were once worth nearly half a trillion dollars.
[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:51.260]   Now they're stuck in a losing game of hedge fund hot potato.
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:53.460]   Oh, there's the purple.
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:54.460]   Why?
[02:12:54.460 --> 02:12:55.620]   Where'd you get this picture?
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:56.620]   That's a great picture.
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:12:57.620]   Oh, get it.
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:12:58.620]   Get a image.
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:04.620]   The day that they took down the famous Yahoo Billboard, I think was the one over one on
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:05.620]   it.
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:06.620]   Yeah, you go.
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:10.140]   And it was neon lit and it had all, it was like a big, it was great.
[02:13:10.140 --> 02:13:11.900]   That billboard was great.
[02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:14.180]   But you see, that was two logos ago too.
[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:18.700]   That was before the Merzamir and before the redesign.
[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:19.700]   Yeah.
[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:21.500]   I forgot all that.
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:26.900]   And I'm sure Apollo will redesign it once again.
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:29.740]   This is the, this is the, from TechCrunch.
[02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:30.900]   The hedge fund up.
[02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:31.900]   From TechCrunch.
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:36.660]   Here's the picture of the Yahoo Billboard, which was a San Francisco legend.
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:39.340]   It was there for years.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:44.020]   By the way, the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium, I didn't go this year.
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:45.620]   I don't think anybody did.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:53.180]   But up till last year had a Yahoo section in the stands at Levi's Stadium.
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:55.980]   And it was a, at least his tickets were there, his season tickets.
[02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:59.140]   It was a little annoying because you'd go up the escalator and the whole way up the
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:01.780]   escalator it would go, Yahoo.
[02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:03.340]   Yahoo.
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:04.820]   I am not kidding.
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:07.020]   Oh my God.
[02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:08.020]   Yahoo.
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:10.020]   Was that like?
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:16.060]   In this piece, I actually cite the Yahoo Yodel and the ads that Yahoo was running back in
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:17.060]   the 90s.
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:18.060]   Yeah.
[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.060]   Where?
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:20.300]   You know, yeah, I'm fast.
[02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:23.420]   You know, and the, and the question was, do you, Yahoo.
[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:24.420]   That's right.
[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:28.980]   And that's been the problem with Yahoo all the time is they've never been able to define
[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:30.180]   exactly what it's for.
[02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:35.140]   It's been for everyone and no one and everything and nothing.
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:39.020]   And they've just kind of slapped Yahoo on, you know, there was Yahoo pets.
[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:41.700]   There was Yahoo bill pay.
[02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:46.380]   But by the way, all individually huge, right?
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:51.340]   The TV.com site was one of the biggest sites on the internet in the, in its heyday, but
[02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:55.020]   they never really knew how to make something of that, right?
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.020]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:02.020]   I mean, the, yeah, broadcast, broadcast.com was YouTube before YouTube or Spotify before
[02:15:02.020 --> 02:15:04.220]   Spotify, but Yahoo.
[02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:06.700]   I don't know if it's mismanagement or was just impossible.
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:08.260]   I don't know.
[02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:10.220]   I think it was.
[02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:12.060]   Oh, and please.
[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:18.060]   Well, I, I think Yahoo was kind of in a trap because when Google was private, they could,
[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:23.740]   you know, essentially put, get a corner on the search market and build all the core
[02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:27.980]   technology before anyone knew quite how profitable it was.
[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:33.140]   And by the time Yahoo tried to catch up, they could not invest as aggressively as Google
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:34.140]   did in just.
[02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:36.660]   And you remember, look at this, look at this.
[02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:38.380]   This is a live web page.
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:39.380]   The, you call it.
[02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:40.380]   I know from Netscape.
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:41.380]   The Necro, what do you call it?
[02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:45.660]   The Necromantic Netscape Internet Service web page.
[02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:47.980]   This is, this is active news.
[02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:50.660]   Yeah, if you go to AOL.com, it's the same thing.
[02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:52.700]   Look at that little copy right now.
[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:57.500]   This is copyright, you know, like, and those are, yeah, all of those feeds are updated.
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:58.500]   Yeah.
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:15:59.500]   Yeah.
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:00.500]   Somebody's doing this.
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:01.500]   Yeah.
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:05.580]   No, I, it's for something I remember reading about this because the AOL.com thing is the
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:06.580]   same way.
[02:16:06.580 --> 02:16:08.780]   And, and it's for people who still have Netscape, you know, addresses.
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:11.780]   There are a lot of people with AOL email addresses.
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:14.780]   They're a lot of them because they call my radio show.
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:15.780]   Yeah.
[02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:21.260]   What I'm going to say though is to, but to go back to Owen's point about, you know, kind
[02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:23.740]   of Yahoo, like Yahoo had a partnership with Google.
[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:28.340]   Like, I think what most of us who are kind of on the older Internet side forget is that
[02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:31.380]   our first exposure to Google was usually through Yahoo because they had a partnership
[02:16:31.380 --> 02:16:34.620]   and Google search was something that Yahoo used.
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:38.020]   And I remember, I mean, I was in high school and I remember at a certain point, I was like,
[02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:40.580]   why should you just go to this Google.com site instead?
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:42.100]   And that'll be better.
[02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:43.500]   But they had this partnership.
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:47.060]   And then to, to Owen's point, you know, they didn't invest and once Google went public
[02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:50.580]   and even before they went public, well, once they really started to kind of grow, it was
[02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:52.660]   like, what does Yahoo do?
[02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:53.660]   Who are they?
[02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:54.660]   What is it?
[02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:57.220]   They clearly are not the search engine.
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:17:00.740]   They have all these disparate, you know, media things that they buy, you know, they bought
[02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:05.900]   Flickr or they bought upcoming, they bought all these services and then didn't do anything
[02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:07.500]   with them.
[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:12.380]   If you were wondering where all those comments against net neutrality came from, the ones
[02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:21.220]   that Ajit Pai used to justify eliminating net neutrality, well, ours Technica has a story.
[02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:31.100]   A big, big ISPs paid for 8.5 million fake FCC comments opposing net neutrality.
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:36.700]   Yeah, I was going to take a shot of Verizon for this, but it turns out I couldn't find
[02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:38.460]   any way to link Verizon to the comments.
[02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:42.260]   I even went to the trade group that was responsible for this to see Verizon finance
[02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:44.260]   that and I couldn't link it.
[02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:50.580]   But if you were charter and AT&T or the big three, yeah.
[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:57.100]   Everyone was broadband broadband for America, but not for you, but for America, for America,
[02:17:57.100 --> 02:18:01.140]   for America, CenturyLink was also evolved Cox.
[02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:04.100]   But yeah, I don't think Verizon was in this.
[02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:05.100]   Good on you.
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:11.260]   Wasn't the FCC very concerned that this wave of comments was some kind of organized hacking?
[02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:13.260]   No, oh, yeah, they did.
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:16.620]   They were like, oh, there's no way because John Oliver.
[02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:18.780]   Yes, it was John Oliver.
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:20.180]   It was John Oliver that did it.
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:21.660]   No, it wasn't.
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:27.260]   18 million of the 22 million comments on that page were fabricated.
[02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:34.420]   One 19 year old submitted 7.7 million pro net neutrality comments under fake randomly generated
[02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:35.420]   names.
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:36.420]   Sure.
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:39.260]   But nobody was better than the broadband for America.
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:42.260]   Yeah, they really did the best.
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:46.620]   And charter and Cox famously consumer from the companies with the best interest of the
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:47.980]   average American in mind.
[02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:50.260]   That's why they have to straighten the resistance to high.
[02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:51.260]   They're so good.
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:52.260]   They're so good.
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:53.260]   Yeah, just tough.
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:54.260]   Amazing.
[02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:55.260]   Yeah.
[02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:56.900]   Oh, let's see.
[02:18:56.900 --> 02:19:03.140]   Oh, this is important because I know Alex Wilhelm, you wasted your youth playing League of
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:04.540]   Legends.
[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:15.140]   The good news is there is a 30 year study from Oxford University, including 430,000 adolescents
[02:19:15.140 --> 02:19:17.500]   from the UK and the US.
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:23.660]   The study has found zero link between the amount of time teens spend on tech devices
[02:19:23.660 --> 02:19:25.820]   and mental health problems.
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:27.900]   Congratulations.
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.460]   So the problem here is then what do I have to blame?
[02:19:30.460 --> 02:19:31.460]   Yeah, no excuse.
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:36.220]   This is not that was my good.
[02:19:36.220 --> 02:19:40.780]   The researchers have prepared mental health indicators like depression and emotional problems
[02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:47.260]   with watching TV, social media use and device use found small drops in the association
[02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:51.700]   between television and social media use and depression and those filling out questionnaires
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:54.060]   across the 30 year period studied.
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:55.620]   There was a small increase.
[02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:59.900]   So in other words, they felt better because they watched TV in the same period.
[02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:04.020]   There was a small increase in association between emotional problems and social media
[02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:05.020]   use.
[02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:08.900]   But in all cases, researchers say statistically irrelevant.
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:12.100]   The change was too small to say there's any connection.
[02:20:12.100 --> 02:20:18.020]   So, and this is as good a study as you get as a longitudinal study over 30 years with
[02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:20.020]   half a million kids.
[02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:21.500]   Well, this is what I think is so important.
[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:25.420]   It goes against so many of the narratives that we've heard, which is that social media
[02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:28.060]   usage is causing teen suicides and so forth.
[02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:34.300]   I think it will do away at least somewhat with a not a hobby horse per se, but kind of a
[02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:38.460]   canard that people were using to go around other issues we have in society like, you
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:42.500]   know, I don't know, the millennial generation having less money than any generation prior
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:44.780]   to it and stuff like that that actually does matter.
[02:20:44.780 --> 02:20:45.780]   Yeah.
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:48.660]   Oh, and you wanted to say something before your friend cut you off?
[02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:49.660]   Sorry.
[02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:55.620]   I think it has less to do with the amount of time you spend on the internet generally and
[02:20:55.620 --> 02:20:56.820]   what you're doing.
[02:20:56.820 --> 02:21:01.220]   I suspect that if they had they didn't cross reference for what they were doing, you're
[02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:02.220]   right.
[02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:06.940]   If it was just League of Legend players, I think you'd get Alex Wilhelm.
[02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:08.380]   I was bad at League of Legends.
[02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:15.700]   I will say if you are a Caitlin Maine who plays ADC bot, I'm your guy.
[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:21.060]   Most of the studies that have found a negative effect look at time spent on social media
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:25.420]   or specific social networks like time on Facebook, time on Instagram.
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:32.220]   So I would like to see a study that actually differentiates in usage matter.
[02:21:32.220 --> 02:21:37.980]   How you use it must must one would think impact your results.
[02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:41.940]   And the other flaw in this study is the teens are self reporting.
[02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:47.060]   So, you know, I mean, it's a questionnaire, but they, but with 430,000 teens, you'd see
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:50.300]   something I think if there were an issue.
[02:21:50.300 --> 02:21:54.460]   Regardless, this makes me excited about all the gadgets I want to buy my nephews.
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:56.740]   And that my sister will be now.
[02:21:56.740 --> 02:21:57.740]   Screen time.
[02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:00.940]   And I'm like, okay, but I want him to have things.
[02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:02.660]   Do you trust Oxford University?
[02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:03.660]   I wonder.
[02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:07.580]   She'll say no, but, but I want to corrupt him.
[02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:08.580]   I know.
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:09.580]   He's so cute.
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:10.580]   Oh my gosh.
[02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:12.380]   Oh, what a squeeze of little chicks.
[02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:16.340]   He is our future Twitter listener because he slept through the thing.
[02:22:16.340 --> 02:22:17.340]   I'm so good.
[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:19.340]   He's been so good.
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:20.340]   He's been so good.
[02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:21.340]   That is so good.
[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:26.460]   Well, let's wrap it up with an inspiring story for young Christian.
[02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:32.440]   This is a GoFundMe for a seven four year old from Brooklyn, New York, who loves SpongeBob
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:37.840]   so much that he bought two thousand six hundred and eighteen dollars worth of SpongeBob popsicles
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:41.740]   from Amazon and had them sent to his aunt.
[02:22:41.740 --> 02:22:47.820]   Fifty one cases containing 900 popsicles each.
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:50.420]   No, I'm sorry.
[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:53.780]   Fifty one cases, nine hundred eighteen total popsicles.
[02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:58.340]   His mom, a social work student at NYU obviously can't afford it.
[02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:04.940]   Her friend put up a GoFundMe to pay for the two thousand six hundred and eighteen dollars
[02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:08.460]   of popsicles, most of which melted by the way.
[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:09.700]   Oh, and eight hundred.
[02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:10.700]   No, eight hundreds.
[02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:12.460]   Oh, and I'm calling them Owen now.
[02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:17.540]   Owen, eight hundreds of them, but couldn't manage to eat all nine hundred and eighteen
[02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:18.700]   popsicles.
[02:23:18.700 --> 02:23:19.700]   But look at this.
[02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:23.740]   The GoFundMe has raised twenty three thousand dollars.
[02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:24.740]   Yay.
[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:27.260]   Everybody loves Noah.
[02:23:27.260 --> 02:23:28.260]   Everybody.
[02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:31.060]   Don Winslow actually gave a thousand dollars.
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:32.060]   Good job, Don.
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:33.060]   Oh, thank you.
[02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:34.060]   This was a fun moment on.
[02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:35.060]   It's so good.
[02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:36.060]   Yeah.
[02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:37.060]   This was a fun moment on Twitter.
[02:23:37.060 --> 02:23:39.820]   I feel like back in the day there used to be these like ephemera that would happen.
[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:43.780]   Everyone like the goat got loose and we all watched it on Twitter together and some funny
[02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:44.780]   thing.
[02:23:44.780 --> 02:23:48.300]   I saw like dozens of tweets about people that were like, you know, we need to hear both
[02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:49.580]   sides of the story.
[02:23:49.580 --> 02:23:50.580]   The kids innocent.
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:54.940]   They just making tons of very lightweight fun jokes about this child and his three thousand
[02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:57.220]   dollar popsicle spend.
[02:23:57.220 --> 02:23:58.220]   But I love it.
[02:23:58.220 --> 02:24:00.060]   I love this sort of wacky stuff.
[02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:01.540]   Good on that child for.
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:04.100]   I don't know how big a sugar crash.
[02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:10.300]   I don't understand how a four year old could figure out how to order two thousand dollars
[02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:11.540]   with the popsicles.
[02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:13.620]   However, there is that question.
[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:16.740]   I think he might have been able to school through the Amazon app.
[02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:22.100]   I'm assuming and just click click click and clip.
[02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:23.540]   I want more mama.
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:24.540]   I want more.
[02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:25.540]   Yeah.
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:26.540]   He's a smart kid.
[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:27.540]   Obviously he's got a future.
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:29.260]   I'm so glad this worked out well.
[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:30.260]   I love this story.
[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:31.420]   This is lovely.
[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:36.940]   There was a time I tried to order five ounces of mortadella and got five pounds.
[02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:40.460]   That's a lot of more to Bella.
[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:42.820]   That's a lot of more to go.
[02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:46.620]   That is a mortadella is an Italian baloney basically.
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:47.620]   Delicious.
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:48.620]   That's a lot.
[02:24:48.620 --> 02:24:50.540]   It's fancy baloney.
[02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:55.700]   I actually took it to my neighborhood deli and they sliced it for me.
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:58.620]   Oh, it came in sauce in the whole sauce.
[02:24:58.620 --> 02:24:59.620]   Yeah.
[02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:05.620]   Wow.
[02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:12.100]   By the way, when confronted by his mother with the order, he said, do we need to order more?
[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:13.100]   Wow.
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:16.860]   So, I don't think he really understood the problem.
[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:19.860]   That's what he wants you to think.
[02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:22.140]   See, this kid's actually a future Bond villain.
[02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:23.140]   Yeah.
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:24.140]   He's that smart.
[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:27.300]   He's already like, huh, do we move the internet to give me something to order more?
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:29.100]   Is that what you're telling me?
[02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:30.100]   Yeah.
[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:35.340]   She apparently is snack ordering privileges have now been revoked.
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:39.020]   Ladies and gentlemen, that is punishment.
[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:40.020]   That is punishment.
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:42.540]   Christina Warren, you are the best aunt ever.
[02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:45.860]   Well, almost as good as this Noah's aunt, but very, very.
[02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:48.780]   I know, I was going to say Noah's aunt is the real enemy people.
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:49.780]   Yes.
[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:51.780]   Thank you for having us, Uncle Leo.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:54.460]   We appreciate it being here.
[02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:57.940]   What a great little eight day old baby.
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:25:58.940]   He's just the best.
[02:25:58.940 --> 02:26:00.500]   He is so good.
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:04.900]   And we're going to name this show this week in Gurgle because he gurgled through the
[02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:05.900]   whole thing.
[02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:06.900]   I know, I know.
[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:08.500]   I was very cute.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:09.500]   I loved it.
[02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:13.380]   You know, I'm a dad and I miss those days.
[02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:16.580]   In hindsight, I miss them at the time I was exhausted.
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:19.820]   So it's very nice of you to do that for your sister.
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:20.820]   Thank you so much, Christina.
[02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:21.820]   It's great to have you.
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:25.060]   I didn't even mention she's a senior cloud advocate of Microsoft.
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:27.420]   You go in a builder, you're going to do it remotely.
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:29.020]   Oh, no, I'm going to build.
[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:30.020]   I'm going to be.
[02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:31.020]   It's going to be remote.
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:34.700]   But yeah, 25th through the 27th, I'm going to be hosting one of the shifts.
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:38.580]   So depending on where you are in the world, you might see me on the screen, but be sure
[02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:42.180]   to tune in and we've got a lot of really fun stuff planned.
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:43.740]   So it's good stuff.
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:49.220]   And now from now on, I'm going to call Owen Thomas, my 50 pounds of mortadella man.
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:51.140]   Was it 50 pounds?
[02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:52.860]   How much did you get?
[02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:54.340]   Oh, he's muted.
[02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:55.340]   Are you muted?
[02:26:55.340 --> 02:26:56.340]   Unmute.
[02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:57.340]   You're not gurgling, are you?
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:59.620]   Just just five pounds of mortadella.
[02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:07.140]   But that was even that I don't I don't think I can even look at a more adult sandwich.
[02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:12.340]   I thought it was five ounces.
[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:17.220]   Oh, and of course is now as senior editor of protocol, congratulations on the new gig.
[02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:18.220]   That's wonderful.
[02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:19.220]   Thank you.
[02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:20.220]   You get to stay home though.
[02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:22.020]   You don't have to move or anything.
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:23.020]   I hope.
[02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:26.340]   You know, I actually am looking forward to having some kind of office.
[02:27:26.340 --> 02:27:28.940]   Hopefully we'll be opening up.
[02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:29.940]   Good.
[02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:30.940]   It's great to have you.
[02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:31.940]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:37.820]   And of course my my good friend, senior editor tech crunch cohost of the equity podcast,
[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:40.180]   the lovely and talented Alex Wilhelm.
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:41.620]   This is like you three.
[02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:42.620]   I love you guys.
[02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:47.380]   I just want to I wish we were in studio so we can share some more and some stories and
[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:54.140]   maybe end up with some spongebob popsicles, but unfortunately alas, we are all socially
[02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:55.620]   distance but not for much longer.
[02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:58.020]   I hope you all stay well and stay healthy.
