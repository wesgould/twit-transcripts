[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.040]   All the way on my left, Devindra Hardowar,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.320]   who's a senior editor at Engadget.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.080]   Great to have you, Devindra.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.280]   Hey, thanks for having me back.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.240]   From Brooklyn, New York.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.080]   Yes.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.040]   Welcome.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.160]   From Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ed Bot.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   From the Ed Bot in the world.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.000]   Finally, I'll see the net.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.840]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.400]   I've known Ed longer than any of you guys,
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.240]   if it's at least, what, we've been 20 years, 30 years,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.240]   almost.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.160]   Yeah, it's decades.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.800]   We've started doing the Devorak radio show with us.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.120]   Yes, Saturday mornings at--
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.880]   A lot of fun.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.560]   It's some big AM station.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.320]   Yeah, some big AM station, that's it.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   It's good to have you.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.240]   Also here, I think the first time in studio, though,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.720]   I'm thrilled to have you Brian, it's Jen.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.680]   Nice to be in Petaluma.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.480]   Thanks for having me again.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.040]   You came all the way to Petaluma.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.240]   Had a nice excuse to drive across the bridge.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   You're in charge of consumer technology at the New York
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.600]   time.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.240]   Why am I telling you?
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.240]   You probably already knew that.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.200]   I'm the only person who writes about consumer technology
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.920]   at the time, so it's a flattering way to say--
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   Really?
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.920]   In charge.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.760]   You're the only one?
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240]   Only person on staff who has a beat.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.520]   Yeah, we have some freelancers.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.880]   We quote you all the time.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.800]   You're violent all the time on the show.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.760]   For better or worse?
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.720]   No, always.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.200]   Always.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.920]   You're authoritative.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.880]   And actually, I thought it'd be kind of fun to--
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.640]   there's so much to talk about.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.160]   And we'll get to SpaceX in a second,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.680]   because that's the happy news of the week.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   But the HomePod came out on Friday,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.400]   and I'm sure you've been reviewing it.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.800]   Devindra, you said something I thought fairly controversial.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.600]   Oh, no.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.400]   Which was that the iPhone 10 was Apple's last great product.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.880]   Does that--
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.800]   Since the only other product since then--
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.720]   It wasn't that long ago.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.240]   It was like--
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.040]   Is the HomePod.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.560]   I'm thinking, is that a backdoor disk for the HomePod?
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.480]   I mean, the HomePod was delayed.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.640]   And even now, it's not fully ready.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.360]   Brian's review is really good.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.880]   Don't rush to buy it, Sispond.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.760]   Well, it's a half-baked product right now.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.320]   I don't know.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.600]   I kind of feel like I was a little bit harder on it
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.680]   than other people.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.360]   Do you guys feel that way?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.880]   You weren't as hard on it as I was.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.320]   Really?
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.880]   OK.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.480]   Because I felt like it just feels like it's unfinished, right?
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.560]   Because Siri does a lot more on the iPhone
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.240]   than it does on the HomePod.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.040]   And so it's been training us to use Siri in a certain way.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.680]   And yet, things like the calendar,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.240]   which I use a lot with Siri, doesn't work on the HomePod.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.520]   Things like hailing a car doesn't work on Siri on the HomePod,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.360]   but it works on the iPhone and other things like that.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.600]   So it just feels like--
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.760]   I don't know why they released it when it's not really done.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.320]   I mean, indisputably, it's not done
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.040]   because that multi-room speaker feature is not out yet.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.720]   So what I don't really get is if they're already late,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   why even come out when it's unfinished?
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.480]   It kind of makes it hard for me to write about because I'm like,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.720]   well, the music part sounds great,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.560]   but all this other stuff doesn't work.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.040]   And that's awkward.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.800]   Devindra, you agree?
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.720]   I mean, I've only listened to it a bit.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.880]   Chris will ask, go ahead and get it.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.680]   It's going to be revealing that for us.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.960]   It sounds really good because it's a $350 super high-tech speaker.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.600]   But yeah, I agree.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.000]   The Siri stuff is it feels really
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.440]   unfinished, really weak in comparison
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.680]   to what we're getting from Alexa speakers.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.480]   I also tested out the Harman Cardin Invoke, which
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.600]   is the Cortana speaker.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.360]   And even that felt more fully featured than the HomePod.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.960]   And that thing's just $200.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   So did either of you get invited to the briefings
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   that Apple had in Coperture?
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.080]   I went to the HomePod briefing about two weeks ago.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.160]   We went to the Audio Lab tour, where they showed us
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.920]   how they tested.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.880]   This was supposed to--
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.360]   you're not getting the cool aids so far.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.560]   So let me channel Tim Cook here and say,
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.000]   but what you guys don't understand, it's not a Siri device.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It's a speaker.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.080]   It's all about the sound.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.840]   We're reinventing how stereos, how speakers work.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.080]   The Siri capability is merely to play music.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.920]   You're thinking it's an echo.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.960]   It's not an echo.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.680]   It's a new kind of music listening device.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.520]   But yeah, so it was Phil Schiller who said that.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.880]   And--
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.520]   Oh, sorry.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.000]   No, no worries.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.920]   Channeled the wrong guy.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.400]   Basically, he was saying, so he's
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.760]   giving us the history of how the HomePod was made.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.320]   So it's been in development for six years on and off.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.840]   They tabled it for a little bit in between.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.240]   And so they started it before Apple music even launched,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.640]   before they even bought Beats even.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.520]   And before HomeKit came out.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.880]   So the HomePod comes out after this.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.440]   I mean, it's in development before that.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.320]   But all this stuff comes out in the middle.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.480]   And then suddenly they had to get this HomePod to work
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.920]   with these new services that Apple has.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.400]   So you can get the sense of why it was so chaotic
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.920]   to develop this thing.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.800]   But then when you try it, you're going to realize,
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.120]   like, hmm, this thing doesn't really seem like it's that
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.600]   polished shit doesn't really seem like it's done.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.360]   So I mean, how much can you justify it being that dumb?
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.280]   It sounds amazing.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.200]   It sounds great.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.360]   But if you're competing--
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.520]   This is where I would disagree.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.080]   OK.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.680]   I don't think it sounds that amazing.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.160]   OK.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.000]   I think Apple fails on all fronts.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.880]   That sounds good.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.760]   It sounds fine.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.200]   It's good.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.360]   That's the first I've heard.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.880]   OK.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.440]   Yeah, look it.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.040]   I'll read some of the headlines.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.280]   Apple HomePod review.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.400]   This is Joanna Stern.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.240]   Super sound, but not super smart.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.520]   They agreed with you.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.320]   I'm more folks.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.480]   Retina for your ears.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.320]   Yeah, I don't know about it.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.800]   Neilai Patel in the Verge said, I am a speaker fanatic
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.960]   and he showed off his analog stereo.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.800]   And I think this sounds amazing.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.840]   But there's a problem.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.240]   There's something called physics.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.760]   And I know that the Australian Prime Minister thinks
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.520]   that physics is not an immutable law.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.040]   But I think physics is an immutable law.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.640]   And this, which is not a HomePod,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.040]   it's just an amazing simulation.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.720]   This is too small to really be a great speaker.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.080]   So I think if you're going to say it sounds good,
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.400]   you really should add the clause.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.160]   It sounds good for its size.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.760]   Sure.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.040]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.440]   And it definitely does fill up the whole room.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.160]   Like a small size--
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.120]   That's one thing that's interesting.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.640]   Because it has two ears all around it.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.240]   So it doesn't need--
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.480]   you don't need to sit in front of it.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.840]   Everywhere is equal.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.560]   And that's it.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.520]   I'm not an audio file.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.080]   So I'm not going to pretend that I know great details
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.560]   about these seven tweeters and all that stuff
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.160]   and have a great attention to detail when it comes to sound.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.040]   But it sounds really good to me compared
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.160]   to a lot of speakers I've tried.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.320]   But I don't think that really justifies the fact
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.000]   that Siri is quite inadequate compared to how it even is
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.840]   on the iPhone or how it's compared to Alexa even.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.400]   Here's a thought experiment, guys.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.320]   So imagine if Apple had waited another year
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   and made all those features work that are missing on Siri.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.560]   And released it as it is with nice music, nice sound.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.640]   And all those nice features working as a virtual assistant.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.640]   Well, there's another problem.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.920]   It only works with Apple Music.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.800]   Here's my opinion.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.760]   That's another--
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.400]   This is designed for somebody who is bathing
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.000]   in the warm glow of the Apple bath.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.320]   This is for somebody because you can't even set it up
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.040]   if you don't have an iPhone or an iPad.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.560]   You can't even--
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.560]   Not even a Mac.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.600]   You can't use a Mac, yeah.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.400]   You cannot use it without an iPhone or an iPad.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.920]   Wow.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.240]   OK.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.440]   That's insane.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.240]   So this is a product designed for somebody who's absolutely
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.120]   in the--
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.240]   I mean, I'm not going to say Apple sheep,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.440]   but somebody who's really in the Apple ecosystem
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.160]   and wants something that's already a subscriber to Apple Music,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.880]   wants something that works with Apple Music.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.000]   It sounds fine for its size.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.080]   My issue is we did a comparison yesterday
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.920]   on the new screensavers.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.520]   We compared the Envok, the Harmon Cardon, which did not
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.920]   sound as good, the Sonos 1, which is-- Sonos is small play one
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.840]   speaker with Amazon Echo built in, which actually
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.960]   wasn't as good but was close and is half the price.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.160]   You could buy two and get a stereo pair.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.880]   That might be fairly competitive.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.560]   We compared it--
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.720]   Or could it play three in an Echo Dot, right?
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.160]   Like there are other ways to do that.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.680]   Compared to a play three or a play five,
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.240]   I don't think the Apple's HomePod is as good.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.160]   And I guess the point I would really make
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.480]   is if you want a good speaker, if you want good sound,
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.640]   this is how I think of it.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.280]   I brought this up, Keith Richards, the guitarist
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.400]   for the Rolling Stone wrote most of their songs
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.960]   with Mick Jagger.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.880]   He got his musical education listening
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.080]   to a tinny transistor radio in bed,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.240]   listening to a pirate radio station out in the ocean.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.440]   It sounded crappy, but that's how he heard
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.760]   Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and became a music fanatic.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.040]   Paul McCartney, same thing.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.320]   I mean, you can--
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.920]   You're still getting some music,
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.000]   but there's all the music that you would hear
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.560]   in a live performance.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.000]   And then with each smaller device, each less capable device,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.560]   you get less and less of the music.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.400]   If you're really into music, you should freaking get a stereo.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.680]   Spend a little bit more money and get a stereo.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.840]   Get two speakers and sit at the apex of the triangle.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.880]   And listen-- and if I put--
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   and I did this, put the HomePod in the middle
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.440]   and listen to my stereo, it's not--
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.840]   it's like a different song.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.880]   It's like different music.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.520]   It's completely a different experience.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.200]   You're getting a half a quarter of the full experience
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.280]   when you listen to the HomePod.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.080]   So for Apple to say, well, no, no, it's not a Siri device.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.440]   It's a new way of thinking about music is wrong.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.040]   And you know, the deal breaker for me, too,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.320]   that I wrote about in the review,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.960]   is it was picking the wrong music for me.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.440]   Despite all the shortcomings of Siri
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.360]   or in addition to all the shortcomings,
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.760]   I was trying to go along with like,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.520]   oh, this should be primarily about music.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.240]   It should be great at playing music.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.000]   And in the Apple Music app, I selected all my favorite artists.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.480]   They were like, you know, SNIS, Radiohead, Talking Heads,
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.520]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.760]   And instead of picking artists similar to mine,
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.400]   I would ask Siri to play some music
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.800]   and it would play Dashboard Confessional, which--
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.800]   I hate that band so much.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.880]   I can beat that.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.880]   I can beat that.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   I hate it so much.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.640]   I said, listen to classical music.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.600]   It played old school hip hop.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.760]   A classical for some, but not what I was going for.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.880]   Sure.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.480]   I mean, you know, I like NWA as much as the next guy,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.840]   but I was thinking something a little bit more mellow.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.000]   I don't know.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.960]   I broke or something.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.000]   And finally, part of that is because Apple
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.520]   is Apple Music's problem, not the HomePods problem, right?
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.280]   I thought Apple Music was supposed to be better.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.400]   So I'm not personally an Apple Music user.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.520]   I use Spotify, but, you know, I had tested it before
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.640]   and these four of you playlists, more or less,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.160]   had some pretty spot on playlist generated from me
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.360]   back in the day when I was testing this.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.200]   It's not as good, I think.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.680]   Spotify's really good, too.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.600]   So when I first turned on the HomePod, I said,
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.840]   play some music, I expected it to look at my history
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.320]   of what I listened to on Apple Music
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.840]   and also the artists that I picked, which is pretty obvious.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   And it was playing all this random stuff.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.120]   Dashboard, Confessionals being one,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.640]   Leroy Francis, I never listened to Selena Gomez.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.440]   I don't even know who these people are, really.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.320]   Selena Gomez.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.000]   Yeah, you know, like somehow it's,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.800]   it thinks I'm a 17 year old or something.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.680]   I think that's, I think in general, that is Apple Music.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.160]   It's aimed at a generation, you know,
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.960]   it's a little even you, or like,
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.640]   you're supposed to be listening to what I like.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   That's the whole point of it.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.680]   So that was really the deal break.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.320]   Well, and go, by the way, go look at Apple Music
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.480]   for classical music, good luck finding it.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.720]   Seriously, it's not, here's the thing.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.200]   Yeah, here's the thing though.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.000]   You make a good point about, is this,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.720]   if you really want the audio experience, then get a stereo.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.160]   But the point of all these devices,
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.920]   the Sonos, the Echo, the Invoke, which I have one of here,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.280]   and this HomePod, the whole point of it is that
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.200]   you shouldn't have to whip out a phone or an iPad.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.160]   You should be able to just drive the thing by talking, right?
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.000]   Right.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.080]   It's the, and so even if it isn't as intelligent
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.280]   as the others, even if it doesn't have the full Siri
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.720]   experience, you should at least be able to go through
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.000]   the basics and say, play this, play that, play the other thing,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.480]   get my entire music collection from the Cloud Play,
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.840]   this album or that album.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.000]   And from what I understand, it doesn't do that.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.120]   And if it doesn't do that, I think Brian's absolutely right.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.000]   Why did they ship this thing?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.840]   There's a case to be made sometimes for shipping things
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.120]   early when they have to be out in the world
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.560]   and people have to be interacting with them
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.280]   so that the engineers can get feedback
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.920]   and they can fine tune the thing quickly.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.200]   But that's not the case here.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.720]   They just shipped this thing before it was ready.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.000]   And given the amount of money that Apple has in the bank,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.640]   I just don't understand why.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.920]   Yeah, it almost feels like they have competitive pressure
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.360]   because Amazon made a killing during the holidays.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.120]   They slashed the price of the Echo to 85 from 99.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.200]   I think those are the numbers.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.680]   And so, they have more pressure than ever to put this thing out.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.480]   But at the same time, Apple has been saying for years,
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   like, we don't rush to be first, right?
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.360]   We're fine with being later and doing a better job
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.360]   than everybody else.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.600]   And in this case, I mean, I think they could only say that,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.480]   you know, maybe Leo disagrees,
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.800]   but they did better with audio quality,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.960]   but they really just dropped the ball and everything else.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.400]   It's decent for what it is.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.720]   There are times when you would want a home pod.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.400]   For instance, in the kitchen, it's great
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.960]   because you don't stand, I mean, if you're listening to music,
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.640]   you don't always get to sit in the sweet spot
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.560]   with two speakers left and right.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.480]   You're in the kitchen, you're cooking, you're moving around.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.160]   And it's great for that because of the tweeters
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.480]   all the way around and it sounds good
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.040]   no matter where you are.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.400]   So I think it's, but it's a single, it's a mono speaker.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.320]   They don't have any stereo option.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.600]   Well, you can add a second speaker
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.280]   that plays at the same time like next to it.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.120]   You can. - No, I said that.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.960]   They can't volunteer.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.800]   - You just use your software update to that.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.640]   - If you cheer up.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.480]   - And that's my point, right?
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.440]   It's not done.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.920]   So why didn't they wait like six months or something
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.280]   to ship a perfectly polished product?
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.480]   That would have been really nice.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.280]   - I think, I blame Apple a little bit
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.920]   because I think the white earbuds
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.600]   that they shipped with the iPhone and the iPod before it
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.720]   degraded the musical tastes of a whole generation.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.840]   That people who grew up with crappling compressed music
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.280]   on crappy earbuds.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.600]   - Do you mean the AirPods or the--
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.440]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.400]   - Just for the original. - Why is it for the original?
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   - The original music.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.480]   - For a whole generation, men and iPod with white earbuds in.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.240]   And that is not frankly a very good quality.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.360]   And I don't want Apple to start saying how great this sounds
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.760]   because I think it's doing a disservice
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.640]   to people who could hear a lot more of the music.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.560]   You can't get a speaker that size for 350 bucks
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.240]   that's gonna be a great speaker.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.720]   You can't, it's great for its size.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.240]   And I think there are even better speakers
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.880]   for that price, frankly.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.880]   - Yeah, the Sonos Play 3 is what, 300?
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.720]   - Yeah.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.600]   - And that thing sounds a lot better.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.560]   - I think so. - As it's more base
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.120]   for one thing. - As more base.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.280]   But you know, Apple's credit,
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.520]   I think what they did really well with the HomePod
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.360]   is that you can push that thing to max volume
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.960]   and it wants to store it.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.800]   - It does handle, like-- - It does handle, huh?
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.400]   - Nothing distorts, I think partially
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.520]   because it doesn't really go as max
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.440]   as some other things, right?
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.200]   We were comparing it to the Google Max
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.320]   and that thing goes much louder
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.400]   and then you start to hear like the base starts to distort
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.160]   and some of the high notes.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.400]   So you could see that Apple's trying to balance something here
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.640]   but I think you're onto something Leo,
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.800]   like everybody who grew up with iPods
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.080]   or just in general, we got used to okay sounding music
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.480]   and most people just don't have speakers in their homes.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.640]   I think that's a bigger thing too.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.000]   - Even with Surat, maybe because people my age might
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.680]   be sitting around watching movies on your big screen.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.160]   - I have all that stuff but I know I'm way
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.920]   in like the minority here but--
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.880]   - I think more people than you think have
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.280]   home theater systems, right?
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.360]   Maybe not, I don't know.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.920]   - It's a good portion of people
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.000]   but I'm talking like mainstream consumers.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.800]   So like just listening to music in your home with speakers
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.520]   is something that kind of died off.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.680]   - I know, people bought-- - And this is good for that.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.000]   - People in my generation bought the stupid Bose Sound
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.640]   Acoustical Way. - Oh God.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.960]   - That was terrible.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.280]   - Paul Harvey-- - That was just the numbers.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.080]   - That would be good. - Yeah, I mean there's--
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.120]   - So I don't know.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.760]   - And by the way-- - Am I big?
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.720]   - My ears are shot from ears of wearing headphones
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.440]   and listening to rock and roll way too loud
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.800]   but I can tell the difference.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.840]   And so I figured that somebody younger with better ears
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.040]   owes themselves something a little bit better.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.240]   The Sonos Play 3 is 250 bucks, it's 100 bucks less.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.960]   - Oh wow. - So then for 50 bucks
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.280]   more you can get a Play 5 which really sounds good.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.200]   And even then though, I wish you would spend
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.280]   a little more and get a stereo.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.040]   - Well let's be ultimate dream.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.680]   I would wish more consumers would do that
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.080]   but what I love about these devices is that Sonos
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.880]   and everything, it made it easy for everybody
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.280]   to bring music out loud back into their homes.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.960]   The big downside with HomePod for me is that
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.040]   it's so limited, right?
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.760]   It's limited to Apple music but we're so many people
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.320]   are using Spotify now or you have your library of music
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.920]   on other devices, there's no aux jack of course.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.120]   There's none of the things you see even in
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.680]   simple Bluetooth speakers these days.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.800]   I really like what Logitech's been doing honestly.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.720]   Like they just released their new lineup
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.920]   which has Alexa built in and they're also like
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.720]   Bluetooth portable speakers that you can take
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.480]   around everywhere, you can put them in the shower
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.080]   or you can take them to the beach.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.320]   There's so much innovation happening here
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.120]   like what HomePod offers just doesn't feel
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.360]   like it's enough today.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.520]   - Well okay, I mean I think we're beating a dead horse.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.120]   But it makes me feel bad.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.000]   I think Ed, you're right.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.080]   I mean I think the future, and by the way,
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.480]   this device, the HomePod is great for podcasting
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.840]   as is the Amazon Echo and even the Invoke
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.200]   because you can buy voice in your house say let me listen
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.440]   to Twitter or let me listen to your podcast
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.880]   and slash film and that's great for podcasting.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.240]   It puts podcasting in a way ahead of radio
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.960]   in a way that I think is gonna be very good for us.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.000]   So I'm not knocking these devices and I agree with you Ed
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.560]   that that's the, but Apple's not selling that.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.000]   Apple's selling it as a great speaker
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.480]   and I think that's doing us a disservice.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.960]   If you just said here's a pretty good speaker
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.600]   that you can listen to music on in your kitchen,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.960]   that's what it is, sure, I'll give you that.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.160]   And Ed, you're right, I mean the Siri at least does that much.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.640]   It plays music, Apple music.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.240]   The fact that it doesn't do Spotify
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.000]   is that's gonna come too, right?
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.200]   - I feel like the HomePod is gonna be one of those products.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.760]   I might review again a year later.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.880]   'Cause it feels like oh by then they'll probably open it
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.480]   to Spotify, Yada Yada and all those features
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.720]   that I mentioned are probably gonna work by then
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.520]   and it'll probably be a great product.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.720]   - It reminds me of the Apple Watch
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.080]   which in the first couple of generations was not compelling.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.600]   - Yeah, they really nailed it on version three.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.120]   - Yeah, I think I'm actually wearing this now every day.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.960]   'Cause if, yeah.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.680]   - Well this was actually the original problem
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.520]   with the original iPhone as well.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.560]   You know, most people forget that the original iPhone,
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.000]   I mean, it didn't support apps.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.680]   It didn't have an app store.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.400]   It didn't support Exchange Mail.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.080]   It had a whole bunch of things that were wrong with it
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.880]   and they fixed that over the first year.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.640]   But that was also one of the things
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.400]   that had to go out into the world
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   and be used by people to improve in that fashion.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.400]   And it isn't necessary with it.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.800]   - It still blew other smartphones away at the time, didn't it?
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.920]   Like the keyboard is awesome and Safari browser
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.720]   was amazing compared to the really pared down browsers
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.800]   on old cell phones.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.600]   So even though there were all these things missing,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.400]   like it's hard to compare with the HomePod I think
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.520]   where like the iPhone at least was a working,
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.400]   functional product.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.240]   - It's a good point.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.400]   The HomePod is late to a market with a lot of competition.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.000]   - I mean, the iPhone was late to the smartphone market as well
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.440]   but it just did a better job at a lot of things.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.800]   - And you look back at the iPod,
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.320]   like that was super limited too, right?
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.840]   Didn't that only work with Max for a long time
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.680]   like ignoring the biggest PC market?
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.760]   - No, but long time, maybe a year or two, I don't remember.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.120]   But they put it out on Windows
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.200]   and that's when it became really big, the iPod.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.040]   - For sure.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.240]   - You know what's funny is we come almost full circle now
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.760]   because at Microsoft's been pushing this,
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.920]   they're probably at the build conference.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.240]   They're gonna talk a lot about progressive web apps
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.400]   which are different, but in a way they're the same
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.560]   as the web apps for the original iPhone.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.240]   The idea that you would go to a website
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.520]   and you'd save it on your home screen
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.920]   and now that's an app on your iPhone.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.800]   That's what, I'm excited about progressive web apps though.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.240]   I feel like that's a, I wish Apple would get behind that.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.640]   They're being a little slow to the party.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.800]   - I think so too, but in both of these cases,
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.560]   in the case of progressive web apps
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   and in the whole competition spotify thing,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.320]   what you're really seeing here is Apple protecting
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.000]   its sort of core services.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And in a way that's very, very Microsoft like.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.160]   They're refusing to disrupt themselves.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.960]   In fact, there was some, forget who wrote this last week,
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.600]   but somebody did a study showing that Apple Music
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.120]   subscriptions are rising faster than spotify subscriptions
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.480]   and Apple Music will probably catch up with spotify
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.760]   by maybe by the end of this year
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.520]   in terms of the install base.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.120]   And so, a cynic could look at this and say,
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.280]   well, one reason that Apple's not putting spotify on this
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.320]   and they're making it difficult for spotify
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.880]   to succeed in the Apple hardware ecosystem
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.480]   is specifically so that Apple Music
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.360]   can surpass spotify in terms of market share.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.200]   - A lot of money there.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.640]   - The proof of that is there's no Bluetooth in the home pod.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.480]   - Yeah.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.080]   - Something that would allow you to open it up
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.320]   to an Android device, for instance.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.680]   - You could still AirPlay, right?
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.880]   So you can still AirPlay from your iPhone or iPad.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.720]   - Yeah, AirPlay.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   - To with spotify or whatever.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.560]   - Apple technology.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.760]   - Yeah, it's proprietary,
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.280]   but you could still use that for spotify.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.040]   So something.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.800]   - Well, let's look at the Apple Watch for comparison, right?
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.760]   So the Apple Watch, you have to have an iPhone
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.280]   to set it up, right?
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.560]   And it's still that way,
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.000]   even though it's more independent than it was before.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.240]   But the Apple Watch so far seems pretty successful.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.800]   So, and you know, this is some inside information,
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   but I've heard that they have considered
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.000]   sharing the Apple Watch with Android phones.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.040]   But what's stopping them is that
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.960]   so many Android people are switching to the iPhone.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.800]   So why would they give people incentive to,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.960]   you know, stay of Android
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.880]   if so many people are switching to the iPhone?
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.040]   You know, so that's how these decisions are made.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.720]   But my point being that, you know,
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.400]   counter argument, the Apple Watch only works with the iPhone
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.120]   and yet people seem to love it
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.880]   and it's still pretty successful.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.480]   - If you're in the, you know what?
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.200]   I bet I would agree with this.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.360]   The advantage of an ecosystem play like that
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.640]   and siloing it like that
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.800]   is you can make it a seamless, great experience.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.080]   And Apple has done that.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.640]   So if you live in the Apple world,
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.040]   you've got continuity, you know, you've got handoff,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.560]   you've got all this great stuff,
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.720]   then your life is easy and smooth
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.920]   and it's better not to have to think about these other guys
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.520]   and what speaker's better?
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.560]   You just buy the Apple speaker
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.440]   'cause it's an Apple speaker.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.000]   That's the advantage. - And that sounds like,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.240]   that sounds like laziness, right?
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.480]   Like what Ed was saying, that is totally Microsoft.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.560]   - People are happy.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.080]   - People are happy, like, yeah, they'll drink whatever,
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.960]   you know, you give them, but this doesn't feel
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   like the same Apple that killed.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.240]   - You can't deny it's profitable.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.440]   - It certainly is, but right,
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.800]   Apple killed the iPod market with the iPhone, right?
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.280]   The iPhone had to kill the iPod.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.120]   - Right.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.280]   - Like think of like how--
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.440]   - And Apple's willing to do that.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.440]   Apple's always been willing to do that, which is--
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.280]   - Are they anymore?
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.080]   - Oh, you think they're not anymore?
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.080]   - That's, we're talking about how safety a HomePod is
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.320]   and I think that's exactly it.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.240]   - Good point. - Yeah.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   - Yeah, well when 70% of your revenue,
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.320]   as it comes from the iPhone, it does Apple's.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.880]   It's pretty hard to imagine killing the iPhone.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.720]   - Well, not the iPhone, but something,
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.280]   like killing its own services, right?
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.480]   Like Apple music, okay,
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.840]   it hasn't been super successful initially,
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.040]   but as it's growing. - But as a point out,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.440]   it's growing. - Yeah.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.480]   - Our bigger for Apple,
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.760]   a bigger portion of the revenue
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.600]   than either the Mac or the iPad.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.440]   - Yep.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.480]   - Services are $10 billion a quarter for Apple.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.200]   So you don't wanna kill those either.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.680]   In fact, you saw the Wall Street Journal
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.280]   said at the growth rate Apple music's going through,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.200]   5% a month, it's gonna eclipse Spotify soon.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.720]   - I wonder who leaked that statistic.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.560]   - Yeah.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.920]   - Journal's really good at reading those.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   - Convenient timing.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.000]   (laughing)
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.360]   - With Spotify's about 2%, they don't include, of course,
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.920]   the free tier, which Apple doesn't have,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.400]   and Spotify has hundreds of,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.320]   a hundred thousand. - Mm-hmm.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.960]   They have a three months trial or something,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.800]   or is it one month?
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.880]   - Three months, yeah.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.360]   - Yeah, they also don't count,
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.960]   and they don't count the family subscriptions either, but.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.880]   - Right, so Ed, do you think it's,
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.000]   I mean admitting that an ecosystem play is strong for Apple.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.920]   You think in the long run though,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.280]   it's gonna hurt them as it did Microsoft?
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.320]   - Well, it has to, because,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.960]   look, I think it's a justification to say,
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.160]   the seamless experience is the goal here.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.520]   That's a great rationalization,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.480]   but the reality is there's just so much money
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.280]   coming into Apple's coffers,
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   and when you sit down in a product meeting
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.280]   and somebody says, okay, I've got this great idea,
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.640]   and, but it's going to hurt this business
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.680]   that's bringing us $10 billion a quarter,
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.440]   there's somebody there who's going to say,
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.160]   nope, we don't do that, we're not gonna do that.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.200]   And that ultimately, once the numbers get that big,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   once the, the, the, the fiefdoms,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.120]   the individual fiefdoms within, you know,
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.240]   the giant spaceship there, become powerful enough,
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.080]   then they start to,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.040]   they start to block innovation,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   and they start to build moats around each of their businesses,
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.840]   and I've seen that, I've seen that play happen before.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.920]   It's what happened to Microsoft in, you know,
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.640]   it led to Windows Vista.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:53.040]   - And I have on, I have on my wall,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.160]   and I'm very happy to have it a signed copy
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.360]   of this fabulous cartoon from Bonkers World
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.240]   of the various org charts,
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.120]   and of course, Microsoft's was all the fiefdoms
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.520]   shooting at all the other fiefdoms,
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.760]   and it, yeah, it hurt Microsoft badly,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.440]   and actually, to Sachin Adele's credit,
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.200]   I think he's changed Microsoft,
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.520]   and the attitude is very different now, it's--
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.360]   - Dramatically.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.160]   - And it's made a difference in their operations,
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.320]   significantly. - For sure.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.280]   I feel like I bring this up every time I come on,
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.520]   but it does feel like Microsoft is doing a lot
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.920]   of the happily stuff, right?
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.280]   Like the surface, the innovation behind the surface laptops,
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.880]   the surface book, the surface studio
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.120]   that you're using right now, Leo,
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.200]   like these cool new devices that we're sitting here
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.800]   and watching Apple take away the ports
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.400]   people actually use on their MacBook Pros,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.360]   and give us keyboards that everybody hates.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.160]   Everybody hates that keyboard,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.040]   and I don't see we're seeing any indication
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.720]   that that's gonna be fixed eventually,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.240]   like Apple's just going with this super flat design.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.760]   A lot of things that we expect Apple to fix
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.200]   were just not seeing anymore,
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.960]   and that's where it can be, honestly.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.680]   Like I think to me, like Tim Cook
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.360]   is feeling more and more like Steve Bomber,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.040]   like he's doing a good job of really, you know,
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.680]   pushing every product line and ramping everything up,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.840]   but I don't know if we're gonna see the innovation
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.880]   that we're kind of used to expecting from Apple.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.720]   - Yeah.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.440]   Let's take a little bit of a break.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.000]   When we come back, we're gonna talk about
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.080]   the feel good story of the week.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.440]   We watched it live on Tuesday.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.680]   We interrupted Mac break weekly
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.160]   to watch the Falcon Heavy launch,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.640]   and I love, I really loved Elon Musk's marketing.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.400]   He went on one of the early morning shows that day,
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.820]   and said, "Well, the engineers tell me
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.320]   there's about a one chance and three
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.520]   it's gonna blow up."
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.720]   I think it's about one chance and two.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.960]   Why would then, now how would you not watch this launch
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.160]   if there's a chance that's gonna be the biggest explosion
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.280]   in the history of mankind?
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.400]   You have to watch, right?
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.400]   It turned out, of course, to be flawless,
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.880]   and there were some really amazing moments.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.320]   We'll talk about that.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.200]   But first, I wanna talk about our sponsor, Texture.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.160]   Texture is single-handedly, I think, saving magazines.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.720]   And I love magazines.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.440]   Some of the best writing today comes from the New Yorker
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.240]   and the Atlantic and even Rolling Stone.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.920]   But the problem is if you were to subscribe
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.600]   to all these magazines, besides your coffee table buckling,
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   your checkbook would buckle under the weight.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.120]   You can't go and buy individual magazines.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.640]   So Texture is like the best solution.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.440]   It's kind of, think of it as Netflix for magazines,
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.440]   one very low flat rate for over 200 of the nation's best
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.280]   magazines.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.440]   And you get every page of the magazine
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.960]   that's on the new "Stand Plus Past" issues,
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.240]   plus bonus features you can't get in magazines,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.080]   like video,
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:49.360]   National Geographic, I get stuff like Ad Age
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.600]   and Hollywood Reporter, which I would probably not
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.920]   subscribe to 'cause they're so darn expensive.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.800]   But I can read it, I can keep up on my industry.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.400]   I can see the Billboard Hot 100.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   Yeah, occasionally I might wanna look at People magazine.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.600]   I certainly wouldn't wanna subscribe to it.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   Vanity Fair.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.800]   And what's really nice about the images,
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.760]   I love photography.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.240]   Vanity Fair has its 24th annual Hollywood issue right now.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.120]   Here it is on my iPad.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.840]   And what's fun is, yeah, it's gonna be just like the magazine.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.320]   By the way, including the ads, but you can also zoom in.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.960]   So if you wanna see this famous third leg problem here,
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.000]   you can zoom in and say,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.280]   "Oh, they fixed it and that's funny."
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.400]   Or did they?
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.520]   What's going on?
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.360]   You can zoom in on that.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.640]   Actually, I think this is different than the cover.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.000]   I think they fixed the third leg problem.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.840]   Who is that?
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.440]   That's Reese Weatherspoon?
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.760]   She, Oprah said, I think she had,
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.800]   I think there's a Photoshop issue
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.520]   'cause her leg shouldn't be bending like that.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.320]   I guess that's true.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.920]   And they think that that was two pictures blended together.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.160]   Well, you can really do some pixel peeping if you want.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.560]   And you can read, of course, every article.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.200]   And it's easy too because the table,
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.960]   this is one example, this is Vanity Fair,
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.720]   but the table of contents goes right to the article.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.360]   So you say, "Oh, I wanna read all about Steve."
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.080]   And you can see it.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.560]   Great political writing, great news writing.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.840]   Texture even has a curated section that I love
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.360]   that shows highlights.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.360]   So you can see stories just for you,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.800]   new and noteworthy stories, long reads for the week.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.600]   Why is no profit Tesla so loved by Wall Street?
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.120]   That's it, that's a good one.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.040]   Car and driver, look at this.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.400]   There's so many great magazines
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.440]   and it's gonna be a free trial for you.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.000]   If you go to texture.com/twit, try it for free
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.200]   if you decide to buy $9.99 a month
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.360]   for unlimited access to more than 200 magazines.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.000]   Texture.com/twit.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.520]   If they automatically download on my iPad,
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.440]   so when I'm traveling, I know I've got 20 magazines
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.120]   in my briefcase, I love it.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.840]   Texture.com/twit, try it for you right now.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.040]   Brian X Chen is here from the New York Times.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.360]   He's there one and only.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.720]   It says lead, consumer technology is writer.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.240]   It's so low, consumer technology.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.840]   He's in the front, he's in the back, he's everywhere.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.200]   I kinda like the home pod.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.840]   Nice that you came up, I appreciate it.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.720]   Yeah, Apple's only speaker.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.920]   They actually did a speaker, didn't they?
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.800]   The HiFi, the iPod HiFi,
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.240]   they've flopped pretty quickly.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.800]   Although-- - We're trying to track one down.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.600]   - I remember Steve Jobs at the event
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.800]   'cause that was when I got to still go to events saying,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.160]   and Steve was an audio file.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.840]   Famous, loved his music, had two bamps and all that stuff
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.880]   and big clip chorons.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.080]   He said, he's such a good marketer.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.320]   I'm throwing away all of my audio equipment.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.120]   This iPod HiFi is so good.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.800]   (laughing)
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.240]   Anyway, yeah, right Steve.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.120]   Also, Devinda Harderwar from Engadget.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.280]   Ed Bot is also here from ZDNet.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.880]   Great to have you all. - Okay.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.120]   - Did you watch the Falcon Heavy launch?
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.240]   - Of course. - Oh yeah.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.160]   - I haven't seen it.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.600]   - What?
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.040]   Brian X-chan, you kidding me, you haven't seen it?
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.320]   - Too busy writing about the home pod.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.480]   - Okay, what? - I have a live view
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.040]   of the Falcon Heavy. - Let me turn down
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.400]   the sound a little bit.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   And we'll, you can actually go to watch this on YouTube.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.400]   The SpaceX channel.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.760]   This is, now John is our space expert.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.640]   John, I think I've been saying this wrong.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:34.640]   This is the largest rocket ever operational.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.120]   So the Saturn V, which took man to the moon, was bigger.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.160]   But this is big because in order to get a man flight to Mars,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.960]   you need to get enough velocity to get there, right?
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.120]   Not just to break out of Earth orbit.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.400]   So, should we watch just a little bit of the countdown?
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.600]   - Yeah, this is a range for launch.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.760]   - This was so exciting.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.240]   I've watched every space launch.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.240]   I'm sure you did too, Edwin, as a kid.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.640]   - Oh yeah. - They did a good job
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.280]   of programming this whole thing too.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.880]   - Yeah, this is their feet. - It was really well done.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.880]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.720]   - And they had, you'll hear crowd noise mixed in.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.520]   (crowd talking)
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.000]   And now remember, no one knows.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.640]   If, you know, if 27 engines is one's off
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.040]   by just a bit of go sideways, it could blow up.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.360]   It really is just a giant bomb on a stick.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.200]   Perfect, perfect.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.280]   - It looks like Elon Musk's middle finger to Earth.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.360]   Just like screw you guys, I'm out of here.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.960]   - I'm going, I'm going.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.120]   Let's see, booster engine cut off.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.800]   Let me jump ahead, this is my favorite part,
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.200]   the booster landing.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.160]   - Right, the landing, the twin landing was...
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.440]   - Oh my God, was that amazing, right?
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.280]   - Yeah.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.480]   - Let me see if I can find that.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.120]   Because they, you know, the challenger, they,
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   oh, look at, oh, oh, it's like,
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.600]   oh, these rockets land themselves after they're done.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   Listen to the crowd.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.120]   (crowd cheering)
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.920]   - He really didn't mix that in, didn't he?
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.080]   - He's like, oh, this is awesome.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.280]   - Wait a minute, I gotta see that again.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.040]   That's just, wait a minute, that's just...
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.880]   - Oh, I can't hear that.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.360]   - That's just too good.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.720]   So the boosters are bringing themselves in.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.440]   The third engine, the main engine did get lost at sea.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.200]   - And the landing burn has started.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.720]   - It's like a rock concert.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.240]   - The boosters looking to be on track
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:46.820]   towards the respective landing
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.320]   - This is brilliant production, right?
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.720]   - All right, one more thing though,
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.320]   we gotta talk about brilliant marketing.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.960]   So as, I didn't believe it when he said it,
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.800]   but Elon Musk said, "We're gonna put my Tesla,
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.040]   Cherry Red Tesla Roadster, my original Tesla,
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.440]   on the rocket as a test payload.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.920]   We're gonna have a dummy in their dressed as star man.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.360]   And there'll be a loop of David Bowie's space out of the
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.840]   playing.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.960]   What they, what I didn't know is that the fairings
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.880]   would come off the capsule, that there were cameras
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.280]   all around it and that they would stream thanks to NASA's
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.240]   high altitude streaming system.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:28.160]   They would stream pictures of the star man with the earth
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.320]   settling as he rotates around the earth.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.360]   It's rising and setting in the background.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.700]   Just beautiful images.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.560]   And by the way, it doesn't say Tesla in the screen,
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   it could have.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.000]   It says, "Don't panic, but we can't forget
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.480]   there's a little bit of a tea there on the steering wheel."
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:53.880]   It's about the best ad for Tesla ever, right?
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.480]   I mean, this is great marketing.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:01.800]   I want a screensaver of star man,
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.000]   just going around the earth.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.880]   So then they launched out of earth orbit for,
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.140]   they stayed there for a while, right,
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.960]   John, a few hours.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.440]   And then they launched out of earth orbit on its way to Mars.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.960]   Is it gonna slingshot around Mars and then come back?
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.280]   To the asteroid belt where it's going to end its trip
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.400]   and orbit the sun forever and ever
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.240]   or until it's pulverized by atomic dust.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.760]   Whichever comes, whichever comes.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.080]   So kind of like us.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.920]   Yes.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.960]   Yes.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.560]   Just an amazing, great marketing.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.320]   You gotta say that, but at the same time,
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.280]   it makes people feel good.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.520]   Jeff Jarvis tweeted, "This reminds me of the '60s,
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.960]   chaos below and hope above."
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   Okay.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.280]   Nothing more to say, Brian, you just, you know,
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.840]   just forget that home putt.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.040]   And yet we're having trouble making Tesla Model 3s.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.880]   Oh, can we mention $675.3 million quarterly loss?
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.960]   Slight problem.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.120]   Only $250,000 went into orbit with that roadster
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.760]   according to cat hall writing for the register.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.840]   I love the registers headlines.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.400]   They picked such a great picture of Elon there also.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.800]   Yeah, you wonder what he's, what's going through his mind.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.480]   I should say full disclaimer, I drive and purchase to Tesla
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   'cause I wanted to support what he's up to.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   I think Tesla's pretty exciting.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.720]   The Model 3 has been a troubling.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.920]   Half a million people on the waiting list.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.960]   I am one of them.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.800]   I admit I put it around some of them.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.080]   Oh, you're gonna get two Teslas.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.400]   Not yet, I'm 18 months out.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.200]   Oh, I do.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.840]   I have a little toy Tesla in the hallway,
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.560]   but I got that for free.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.400]   I didn't pay for that.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.880]   I got that 'cause somebody bought a Tesla
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.720]   and used my name.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.240]   Thank you, wherever you are.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.760]   I've seen people like posting their Twitter pics
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.960]   and Instagram pics of getting their Model 3s.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.280]   So it's happening and that that's something.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.360]   It's just not as fast as it should be.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.840]   I haven't heard problems with the people who own them,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.240]   have you?
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.880]   No, I haven't really heard any either.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.240]   I've seen the wrong music.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.080]   (laughing)
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.240]   It's playing the wrong music?
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.680]   (laughing)
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   Dashboard confessional keeps coming.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   Oh man.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.520]   Oh man.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.160]   That is something surprising that Teslas
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.440]   do not support Android Auto or CarPlay Apple's solution.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.720]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.560]   Do you?
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.400]   Yeah, I mean, personally,
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.280]   so I have a pretty old Prius.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.480]   I know that's lame,
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.520]   but I just stick in my iPhone and use Bluetooth to control,
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.040]   Spotify and whatever I want.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.120]   And I don't want any of this Apple CarPlay
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.160]   or Android, what's it called?
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.600]   Android Play, I don't know.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.240]   You already sound like an old man.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.720]   Oh, I know.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.240]   When I rent cars, I rent cars every now and then
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.080]   when I travel, right?
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.280]   And I have to use these Apple CarPlay features
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.760]   'cause I have an iPhone and it barely works, right?
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.920]   Like it has like four apps or something
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.760]   and it forces you to use Apple Maps
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.080]   and why would you wanna do that?
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.800]   Versus using Google Maps, you know?
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.880]   So I don't know.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.400]   I don't want any of this stuff.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.720]   You wanna actually have a fairly new car
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.520]   that supports both.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   What do you think?
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.840]   Do you use it?
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.080]   Yes, I use it with both
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.840]   because with both Android Auto and CarPlay
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.480]   and to Brian's point, I prefer Android Auto
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.120]   because the Google Maps experience is better,
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.640]   is much better, but either one is better
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.320]   than the built-in navigation system.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.840]   And the one I have, I have a, it's a Lincoln
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.640]   and it's a very nice, it's their sync three.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.080]   You have fourth sync in there, yes.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.760]   In fact, which is Blackberry,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.280]   which is a Blackberry base.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.800]   And it's very good software,
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.240]   but the voice control is just,
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.760]   you have to be so precise with it
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.320]   and if you say the wrong words in the wrong order,
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.560]   it won't do your navigation for you.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   Whereas both Android Auto and CarPlay just work
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.320]   when you press the little speech button
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.600]   and tell them where you wanna go,
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.400]   it takes you there and puts the map up there.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.080]   So I'm actually a big supporter of those things.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.960]   I mean, if you think about it,
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.560]   the time to update a car design and building up there
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.800]   of cars years, but these phones are iterated every year,
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.720]   the software is iterated more often than that.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.800]   You would probably prefer to have up to date
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.720]   Google Maps or Apple Maps in your car
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.280]   than whatever was put on that car when it was made.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.200]   True.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.040]   I mean, do these cars update to software that often?
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:40.880]   Like with the maps?
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.520]   You can, it's not easy.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.720]   Sometimes you have to bring it to the dealer,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.000]   sometimes you have to download something,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.880]   put it on a USB key, carry it out to the auto,
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.280]   start up the auto, press some buttons,
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.440]   maybe it'll want to--
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.800]   And then let the auto run for half an hour.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.880]   Hope it doesn't.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.600]   Hope it'll break your car.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.880]   When I updated the sync three, there was one thing,
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.720]   and it said in the instructions,
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.440]   'cause I read the instructions first,
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.120]   and it said, now when you get towards the end of this,
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.640]   it's going to tell you that it's done,
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.840]   but it's not really done.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.680]   All that-- Oh, geez.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.440]   But that step is done,
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.760]   but it looks like the entire thing is done,
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.840]   so don't pull the USB stick out yet,
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.440]   because it's not really done.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.680]   And these are the people we hope will design
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.760]   autonomous vehicles.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.600]   Oh, boy.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.120]   Their car company's not great at software.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.960]   Sync it, you know, I like the base sync,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.320]   but then they did my Ford Touch, they screwed it up.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.160]   Actually, it's interesting,
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.160]   'cause Ford says now they're going to put Amazon's Echo
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.000]   in their cars.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.040]   The next generation, I think,
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.840]   is going to have Amazon's voice services.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.760]   I mean, we've--
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.840]   Clearly, the car company just can't do it anymore
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.080]   on their own, so yeah.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.000]   That's why we don't really trust--
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.960]   I don't know if we'll see their self-driving
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.560]   being the things that take off, right?
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.960]   I like Elon Musk's response, by the way,
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.880]   in the quarterly call,
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.080]   when he was unfortunately having to talk about
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.160]   the big loss and the trouble with the Model 3,
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.360]   he said, "Well, we can send a roadster to the asteroid belt.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.160]   I think we could figure out how to make them all."
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.000]   (laughs)
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.840]   That's true.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.000]   That's not a good answer.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.840]   Not a good answer.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.680]   Not a good answer.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.760]   Not related.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.200]   If we can send a roadster to the asteroid,
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.240]   we'll probably do it all right.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.560]   Well, it is the funny thing, though, about,
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.040]   you know, this is a,
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.960]   it's both a software and a hardware problem.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.920]   But the interesting thing is that,
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   they have the, you know,
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.400]   they have the design of the car down very well.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.000]   They have the components all built and everything.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   It's getting the manufacturing at scale and speed
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.160]   that is the problem.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.400]   And that, and so that's one of those things where you have,
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.120]   you know, it's a problem that goes back to Henry Ford.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.960]   And you have to, you know, the assembly line has to be running
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.600]   at the exact same speed from start to finish.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.920]   If there's any, you know,
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.360]   if there's any slowdown along the way,
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.880]   every other part of it, it backs up at the beginning.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.520]   It doesn't have product at the end.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.000]   So there's, you know, there's like probably
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.280]   maybe only half a dozen little problems
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.920]   affecting the Model 3 manufacturing line.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.280]   And, and so, you know, one of these days,
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.200]   they'll solve the last one of those, click.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.280]   And, and then all of a sudden,
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.080]   they're, you know, maybe they really are manufacturing 5,000
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.480]   or 10,000 cars a week like they say they can.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.920]   We'll see.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.840]   That was always the knock on Teslas that when the big three,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.280]   when the automakers who have a lot of experience
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.560]   bending metal come in, they're just going to take over
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.720]   that Tesla can't possibly compete in mass production.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.280]   But I'm rooting for, I have to say I'm rooting for them.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.560]   And I don't, for instance, I don't think we would see all
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.280]   these companies doing a, would we do you think see all these
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.840]   companies doing electric vehicles if it weren't for Tesla?
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.080]   No, probably not.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:52.920]   I think they have.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.760]   That's a sad thing.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.120]   It's sad that we have to kind of rely on this crazy
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.040]   billionaire to kind of get out there and make all these things
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:00.640]   happen.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.280]   But yeah.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.880]   I think we've always relied on the crazy billionaires to get
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:04.880]   things done.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.440]   I think that's a, that's a long standing.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.880]   Like the old media barons like, yeah, same deal.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.760]   Yeah, the railroad barons, you know, it takes a certain
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:17.440]   amount of, uh, hutspa, self confidence and a lot of capital
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.040]   to move things forwards.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.400]   Otherwise, you know, you just keep making iPhones.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.840]   Speaking of which.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.320]   Speaking of which, uh, Apple's the only company that has said how
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.760]   it's going to spend its repatriated cash, the new tax law,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:39.480]   uh, pretty much, I think forced companies to pay the 15% tax
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   and get their overseas funds back.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.960]   Apple has billions of dollars.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.280]   In fact, the five largest US technology companies have half
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.480]   a trillion dollars in overseas cash.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:54.960]   Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, all of them took, uh, hits from the
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.720]   new tax bill.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.320]   Google actually had a loss in its quarter because of a $9.9
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.920]   billion tax bill.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.400]   So did Microsoft.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.560]   I mean, well, it was Microsoft's tax bill.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.360]   It was huge, right?
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:09.280]   It was like $9 billion, I think, or 15 billion or something.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.800]   15 billion dollars and a nine billion dollar law that translated
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.080]   to a nine billion dollar loss.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:18.040]   Microsoft is the second large, has the second most overseas
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.360]   money after Apple, I think.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.480]   I think it was one, one, two.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.920]   And both of those companies have done, you know, they've
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.880]   played this interesting game with, uh, Irish.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.600]   It's the subsidiary.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.320]   It's the double Irish in the Dutch sandwich.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.200]   Yep.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.160]   Sounds kind of dirty.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.040]   It doesn't say it.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.320]   No, it sounds delicious.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:42.360]   No, it's it sounds like something that you just don't want to
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:42.840]   Google.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.560]   Sounds like urban dictionary might have something to say about it.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:53.080]   Uh, but it is, in fact, the, the kind of it's completely legal,
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.720]   but somewhat, I think ethically challenged idea that you transfer in
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.080]   Apple's case, they transferred intellectual property rights for a
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:04.880]   lot of their products to an Irish subsidiary and then started
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.640]   making payments to the Irish subsidiary for the right to make the
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.560]   iPhone and the Irish subsidiary turned around and used, uh, I think
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:16.000]   the Canary Islands to, that's the Dutch sandwich to further
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.760]   launder the money paying zero or very low or zero corporate taxes on the money.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.040]   Apple ended up paying though.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:29.360]   38 billion dollars in a one time tax payment to repatriate its hundreds of
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.200]   billions of dollars.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.760]   Apple said that they're going to use that money, uh, to create jobs.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.360]   I think that this is just all aimed at President Trump.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.800]   We're going to create jobs.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:44.240]   We're going to build a beautiful new headquarters in Nevada for 30.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.280]   You know, the complicated part of this is what is that they were already planning
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.960]   on spending X amount of money this year.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.000]   And they have a payment rate, I mean, a spending rate of, I forgot how many
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.520]   million dollars or billion dollars it was for each year.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.560]   And they would have already reached that goal.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.560]   It despite the repatriation.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.960]   So like what I'm trying to say is they were going to spend that money anyway.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.440]   And they're just timing it in accordance to, you know, what's going on in
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.760]   politics to make it sound like they're doing this for the sake of.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:18.160]   Well, we all have to get you a lot of coal right now, but that happened with a
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.960]   lot of like job, like hiring from other companies too.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.280]   Right.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.640]   Microsoft's CFO might have been a little more forthcoming when she was on the
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.240]   call with the analyst, Amy Hood said, when we see an opportunity to invest,
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.960]   we haven't really waited for tax reform to do that.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:37.800]   Microsoft, which has a hundred thirty two billion dollars that it will
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:42.200]   repatriate says no change alphabet, which has sixty one billion dollars to
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   repatriate says no change.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.040]   Amazon says, Hey, we already spent a lot on our workforce.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:48.320]   We're not.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.480]   They have 61 billion Facebook, 16 and also alphabet at 61 billion.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.760]   Amazon only had 10 billion.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.960]   So it's not going to change.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.600]   In fact, according to the Wall Street Journal, Apple's the only company that had
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:04.400]   that said that they're going to take this money and do anything different with it.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.760]   But they always had the option.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.080]   And what they've done for for years now is they just borrowed money, and
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:16.840]   especially since interest rates have been, you know, essentially close to zero.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.360]   So Apple has a hundred billion dollars in borrowed money.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.600]   And they were paying, you know, and they were paying, I don't know what their
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.760]   court, I mean, they're there.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.600]   I'm sure those are triple A rated bonds.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:36.000]   So probably just a couple percent that they're paying there, which was way
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.640]   better than the difference between the, you know, with a 25 or 30 or 35 percent
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.080]   tax rate that they were going to pay on it.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.840]   You know, so it was.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:53.200]   And yeah, this is just that there's absolutely no difference in how any of these
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.640]   companies are responding to the markets.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.480]   They all have so much money available to invest.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:05.200]   If they want their, they're all investing in cloud infrastructure.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   They're, you know, capex like crazy building, you know, building manufacturing
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.640]   capacity for the, you know, for products.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:19.920]   It just, the idea that they're going to do anything different aside from pocket,
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:26.600]   the money and buy back stock and maybe issue a dividend is just nuts.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:32.800]   Uh, speaking of Apple, which we have been quite a bit, I apologize.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.960]   The source code for their, their boot code, I boot was posted publicly by a
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.200]   supposedly low level employee.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.760]   Don't know how he or she got the code on GitHub.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:50.200]   Of course, taken down an Apple file, the copyright claim and forced the company
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.360]   to remove the code, but not quickly enough that people didn't download it.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.800]   I'm sure there's copies all over the place.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:01.520]   I boot is the part of the iOS operating system that's responsible for ensuring
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.400]   a trusted boot of the operating system.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:08.640]   So it's a, I would say for jail breakers and others, this, this code is a huge deal.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.680]   Jonathan Levin, who is a, uh, a jail breaker.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.400]   He's written a number of books on iOS and Mac internals said it.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.520]   This is the biggest leak in history.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.280]   It's a huge deal, but that was right away.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:20.640]   I don't know.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.200]   Maybe if he looked at the code, Apple said this is old code.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:28.000]   In fact, you see copyright 2006, 2007 to 2014.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.720]   So it is fairly old, called may not have anything to do with how current iPhones
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.080]   boot.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:38.720]   Yeah, I think we need like a security researcher to comment on this, right?
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.280]   Is this really a big deal?
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.400]   If it's iOS, is it eight or nine?
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.640]   Um, we're on 11 now.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:51.920]   I, well, except, uh, except when you are dealing with code that's basically
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:58.040]   touching bare metal at that point, those things don't get changed with, uh, with
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:58.760]   each release.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:04.880]   Those are, I mean, that's like the Linux kernel, uh, or, or, or, you know, Microsoft's
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.160]   kernel or the mock kernel.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:11.120]   The kernel is not something that changes with every version.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.200]   It gets tweaked.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.360]   It gets improved.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:20.480]   There are security enhancements made to it, but by and large, that thing is, you
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.960]   know, that's the, that's the core.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.680]   That's the core.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:26.280]   And it doesn't over time, it doesn't change that much.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:31.120]   And, you know, because it's just so basic, you don't dare change it.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:37.760]   Every little tiny, uh, tweak that you make at that level has the potential to
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.240]   ripple up through everything else.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.960]   And so, you know, those things don't, they don't change that often.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:47.240]   I feel like if there's a flaw in it, it will be exposed.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   And this might actually benefit Apple.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.880]   Uh, if somebody comes forward and tries to get a bug bound, actually the, the, the
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.320]   bug bounties for iBud are the largest bug bounties Apple offers hundreds of
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.160]   thousands of dollars.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.840]   This might be a not a bad thing for Apple.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.120]   Also benefit the FBI.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:02.880]   If they want to hack it on.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.280]   And say he's going, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.360]   Finally we get in.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.400]   Did any, I'm a T-Mobile customer.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.440]   Uh, I think a lot of T-Mobile customers got a text message scared the hell out of
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:22.360]   me, uh, saying, uh, quickly add a pin to your account because there's an industry
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.080]   wide phone hijacking scam.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.200]   I got this.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.600]   I don't know if you did T-Mobile alert.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.800]   We've identified an industry wide phone number port out scam, which means
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.640]   somebody calls a representative and says, Hey, I want to, uh, take my phone
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.920]   number to another phone.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.800]   And of course, when they do that, that will, uh, break, you know, two-factor
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.040]   authentication using texts, which is one of the reasons that is not a good way to do
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:47.800]   two factor.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.240]   A lot of my bank still does.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.960]   A lot of, a lot of, uh, banks do.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:56.240]   Um, motherboard says, uh, that a copy of your representative said its entire post
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.080]   paid customer base was messaged.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.040]   So if you didn't get the alert, you probably will.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.920]   Um, I immediately called T-Mobile and put a pin on my account.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.800]   But I'm one, I'm wondering, uh, if this, uh, is, is all of a sudden been a big
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.400]   problem.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   Uh, I can't think of another time a company's done this, you know, said that
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   everybody turn on effectively turn on two factor on your account.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:23.040]   I mean, this is a thing that honestly we should be doing anyway.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.920]   So I don't, maybe when people create T-Mobile accounts, they should be like
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.840]   making this more mandatory or something.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.600]   Uh, but we, I think we've seen instances where somebody's, you know,
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:38.120]   information, um, you know, a hacker's able to social engineer and get control
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:38.840]   of somebody's account.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.400]   And usually it's because there's no pin.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.720]   There's no like extra authentication on their account.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.200]   Right.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:48.960]   And, uh, you know, the really, the weak spot is aptly named customer service.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:52.880]   Personnel customer service representatives, they get called and they're
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.000]   trying to serve the customer.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.840]   The problem is it's not really the customer.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.840]   It's somebody pretending to be the customer and they try to be helpful and
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.520]   they end up, um, not servicing the customer.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:07.440]   So, uh, I called and I got one very quickly, just a public service message,
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.120]   uh, probably on any, on any mobile account that you could do that with,
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.080]   you should probably do that.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.160]   Sim hijacking is very real.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:19.680]   Yeah, I had an interesting experience, uh, in, in regards to that, Leo, they,
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.640]   I have an account with a company called Ting.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.640]   I have a Ting account.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:24.960]   They're great.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.640]   You know, they're really, really great, uh, really, really great service.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:34.520]   And I was porting a number into it and something went wrong with it.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:40.600]   Um, and at any rate, long story short, in order for me to complete the port,
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.560]   I had to go through a process with their security people that basically involved,
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:52.400]   uh, it's the, the same sort of, of challenges that you would get.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:59.360]   Um, if you're, if you're applying for a mortgage and, and doing online stuff where
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:05.760]   they said, you know, you, uh, you, uh, you applied for a, an automobile loan in
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.040]   2015, what company was that with?
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.200]   And it gives you four choices.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.480]   And a lot of times all of them are wrong.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:18.960]   Um, and, and I had to answer about 10 questions like that, uh, before they would,
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.480]   uh, even allow me access to my account.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.960]   And that, you know, so that was reassuring in a way.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.640]   Yes.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.440]   A pain in the butt, but still.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:33.920]   But I'd read it, but it's not nearly as much of a pain in the butt as, as having
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:39.040]   someone, uh, have access to essentially what is the universal two F.A.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:39.520]   Right.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.600]   Device and then, you know, and then whoops, they're into your bank accounts and
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.680]   they're into your credit cards and everything.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.240]   Another fix for this is to tell your bank and everybody else should stop using
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   text messages, uh, you know, use a authenticator programs or some better
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.480]   solution than text messages.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.120]   We're just getting started, but yeah.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.160]   I mean, I feel it's so hard to get people to use two factors.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.000]   First place.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:02.440]   Right.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.720]   So I think they just are holding people's hands and saying start with the text
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.560]   messaging thing, because no one uses this anyway.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.640]   And Google's started doing something, which is really great, which, and
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.600]   Microsoft does this too.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.760]   In fact, I love it on the Microsoft account where you have to have the app,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:18.880]   the Microsoft app on authenticator app on your phone, but then instead of
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:22.960]   giving you a six digit number, it'll pop up a notification saying you're trying
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:27.200]   to log in sometimes even before you enter the password, you just give it the
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.160]   email and say you're trying to log in and you say, yes, and then it does a
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:30.800]   funny thing.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:34.560]   It says, okay, there's a two digit number on your screen, which of the four
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.800]   two digit numbers on this screen is that.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.040]   So you verify you're looking at your screen and then it logs you in without a
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:40.560]   password.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.240]   I think that's more secure.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.960]   I know duo security uses that.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:48.280]   Google is using that even more secure, probably than an authenticator program,
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.280]   because you have to have physically have the phone.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:55.520]   It's not an SMS and it's not even a secret number in an authenticator app.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.960]   It's actually direct communication.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:57.760]   It's like a key fob.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.480]   I use a UBA key for my Google account.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.680]   That's the one I don't want to lose.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:06.440]   So actually that's really a pain, but you also feel like they're going to have to
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:11.080]   steal my my UBA key to get my Google account.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.480]   Let's take a little break.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.880]   We're talking high tech, the week's tech news on Twitter.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.960]   We had a fun week on Twitter.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   Actually, can we, do we have the promo we made?
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.360]   Here's a little bit of, here's a look at what you might have missed if you
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.160]   missed anything this week.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:31.120]   Previously on Twitter, the Falcon Heavy largest rocket ever made launched
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.480]   successfully today.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.240]   And this is live footage.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:40.040]   Watch this from the Roadster floating in Earth orbit right now.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.440]   Oh, you're kidding me.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.600]   This is not making this up.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.720]   But you think I was.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.960]   You guys are having fun over there.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.240]   The new screen series.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.960]   We have the Apple HomePod.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.840]   You Apple saying, no, no, don't think it is a Siri device.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.480]   It's not a competitor to the Amazon Echo.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.680]   It's a speaker.
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.200]   I want to make sure people don't buy this thinking I'm getting the last stereo
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.960]   speaker I'll never need to buy.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.960]   Apple's almost positioning it that way.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.280]   Like these are so good with computational audio and it just isn't.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:12.160]   No, how flying FPV is.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.080]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.840]   Oh my goodness.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.360]   That would help me fly better.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:19.960]   Like Megan.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.040]   Okay, let's go get Megan.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.200]   It's because. Oh, no.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.320]   Oh, no.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   That's what all of my drone flights look like.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.040]   This week in Google.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.440]   Oh, no, John Perry Barlow has passed.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.880]   Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.680]   No, that makes me so sad.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.160]   Ben Hill for quite some time.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.320]   John Perry Barlow.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.160]   Oh, he was a grateful dead lyricist.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.200]   We're the great gentlemen of the open internet.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.800]   A classy guy, a Montana rancher who also helped founded the electronic frontier
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.880]   foundation and did so much to promote the free internet.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:59.760]   We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere,
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.640]   may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular,
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.400]   without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.680]   We'll miss you, Perry.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.040]   John Perry Barlow.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.560]   Really great guy.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.120]   Our show today brought to you by my doorbell, my ring video doorbell.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.600]   I actually turned the sound on my iPad because all morning long it was going
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:32.000]   off. Nobody has entered the house in the last few minutes, so I didn't get the ding dong.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.800]   This is so cool.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.560]   On your phone, on your tablet, no matter where you are, anywhere in the world,
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.320]   you can hear somebody at your front door.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.880]   You can hear somebody ring your doorbell and you could talk to them.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.200]   You could see them and you can talk to them.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:49.120]   And now ring has expanded their offerings to the ring floodlight and the spotlight cam.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.320]   So you can build a ring of security around your entire property, the ring video doorbell,
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.040]   the floodlight, the idea of the floodlight cam is it's basically the same as the ring video
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.320]   doorbell without the doorbell.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.960]   It is those motion activated lights you've seen, but attached to it is a high def camera
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:11.840]   and a speaker and a microphone and a big alarm, 110 decibel alarm,
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.480]   so that you can, it's pretty cool.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.960]   You can see anybody in your backyard and your side yard, wherever you put the camera,
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.000]   you can speak to them.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.600]   You can chase them off if they don't leave because you tell them to.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.640]   You play that alarm.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.120]   It'll definitely scare them off.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:27.840]   Ring really works.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.640]   All you have to do is go to twitter.com/ring and look at the videos that they post
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:38.000]   from the ring video doorbell of people for this is it's got a night camera.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.760]   This guy thinks he's breaking into the truck.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:46.160]   And so he triggered the siren watch on the floodlight cam as the guy gets in
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.560]   and run, run.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.560]   I should play the sound because it's he's.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.800]   That scared the hell.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.000]   That's it.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.560]   Got it here.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.200]   Never come back.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.680]   And get out of here.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.400]   Never come back.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.480]   He said, I love what?
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.680]   Sometimes the videos are surprising.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.640]   It looks like an Eagles fan here celebrating their super bowl victory.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.040]   Go to a ring or twitter.com/ring.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.320]   Yes, if you want to see some of these amazing videos, here's some guys who are about to rob a
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:18.560]   house.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.120]   They notice they literally notice the ring camera.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.000]   See the guy pointing to it and they say, yeah, maybe not this house.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.600]   We'll go next door.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.800]   I love my ring.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.240]   I love the floodlight cams.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.840]   And now we've got a great deal.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.560]   The ring of security kit includes a ring video doorbell.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.960]   Your choice of either one, two or three floodlight cams.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.880]   You get up to $150 off on a ring of security kit.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.360]   Ring lets you see and speak to intruders from your smartphone from anywhere.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.560]   And you can even share video clips with neighbors using the ring act.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.240]   They have this is a really kind of a neighborhood watch system that works.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.680]   That really works.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.600]   Ring.com/twit for the ring of security kit.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.200]   Save up to $150.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.200]   You got to get this ring.com/twit.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.440]   And if you already have it, get it for a family member.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.200]   This is they're going to love you forever.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.240]   Ring.com/twit.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.480]   This is one IoT device you really want.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.720]   I love looking at these videos on the Twitter feed.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.320]   Oh, crooks, they'll never learn.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.200]   They'll never learn.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.280]   I love them.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.320]   I love them.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.040]   All right.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.640]   I am a little perturbed about this, but I wanted to know what you think.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:33.200]   Google has announced that starting in July, if you are a website and you're not secure,
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:40.320]   you're not HTTPS, you're not using TLS encryption, you will be labeled in Chrome, not secure.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.320]   Now, twit.tv is of course HTTPS.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.200]   And we did that because Google even said we were going to improve your search results.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.480]   But I have other sites that are not that don't have logins.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.400]   They don't have customer accounts on there.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.480]   I see no reason for them to be secure.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.520]   And yet, I don't want to be branded insecure, even though what does security mean?
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.720]   If you go to visit the tech guy site, there's no login.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.160]   What would security mean there?
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.480]   Is Google going too far?
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.400]   This is going to start with Chrome 68.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.000]   So I thought they already do this because in my experience, when I visit sites,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.480]   Chrome gives me a warning saying that this thing is insecure.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.320]   It's not protected by HTTPS.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.920]   But what's the difference now?
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:23.120]   Are you using a more, maybe you're using a beta version of Chrome?
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.080]   No, I think so.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.360]   If it's a site that's asking for information, like has form fields and stuff,
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.120]   I think you'll get that alert if it's not secure.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:29.760]   Oh, but this, yeah.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.120]   So let me go to tech guy labs, which is our radio show site on Chrome.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.760]   This is just an HTTP site.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.880]   Yeah, you don't get any warning.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.520]   And the bar at the top doesn't say insecure site.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.560]   Yeah, it should say insecure if you're banking or buying something.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.600]   But that's the point is that Google is going to start branding sites like the radio show site.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.840]   And it's by the way, not cheap because it's not merely going out and getting a certificate.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.840]   The site is not designed to be HTTPS.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.840]   It's a couple of years old.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:07.120]   I'm going to have to go back and recode much of the site to support secure browsing,
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.960]   or I'm going to get branded, not secure, as if it matters when you're visiting a read-only site.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.440]   Right.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.120]   But I mean, yeah, here's the thing.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.240]   It doesn't matter if it's even branded because, yeah, it's not going to matter to the user.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:20.960]   But go ahead, Ed.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.800]   Well, but here's the thing.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:30.720]   What you're saying there, Leo, is that the billions of people who use the internet
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.400]   can be trusted to decide, oh, OK, this site doesn't need to be secure, but this one does need
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.280]   to be secure.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.480]   And that's the problem.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:44.560]   When you don't have HTTP, and I used to feel the way that you did,
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.360]   I used to feel this was a burden on people like me.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.440]   I had to go back and redo a couple of websites also.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:07:01.360]   But if you have a system that's bifurcated like that, then you've put an onus on people to make
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.440]   decisions that they're not capable of making.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:10.800]   And so what Google has done, and I agree with them, and I think Microsoft is doing the same thing
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:18.160]   with versions of Edge that are coming out, is to basically say, look, HTTPS everywhere,
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.720]   because that way you don't have to think, oh, does this site need to be HTTPS?
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.600]   You just say, make it everywhere.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.720]   And then you don't have to make a trust decision.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.040]   And every time you can eliminate the need for people to make a trust decision,
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:39.680]   you eliminate the possibility that someone will make the wrong trust decision.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.760]   For sure. Leo, you have enough experience like helping people with the tech guy
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:46.640]   should run everything.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.000]   I just don't want to do it.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.480]   That's the thing you're thinking.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:56.240]   There is an argument that if your site is not secure, you could do a man in the middle.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.680]   So somebody could do a man in the middle on tech guy labs and ask for credentials.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:08.000]   People would think they're on tech guy labs, and then thinking it's Leo, I can trust him,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.080]   give them something that they shouldn't be. So I do understand that.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.040]   I just feel like it's a bit of a burden.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.320]   Doesn't it kind of remind you when Steve Jobs said the iPhone is not going to support Flash?
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:20.800]   Yes.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.200]   And said, screw Flash, it's got to die, it's got to go.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.120]   It's very much like force everybody to stop using Flash.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:28.000]   So I guess it's kind of doing a similar thing of HTTPS.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.840]   It helped that everybody hated Flash, though.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.160]   It would be nice to have a...
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.200]   I once interviewed Vince Serf, the father of the net, and I said,
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.800]   if you were to redesign TCP/IP, knowing what you know now is there's something you'd do differently,
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.960]   he said, yes, I would make it secure, I would build an encryption.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:50.720]   So, yeah, the world would be a better place if it's HTTPS everywhere.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.400]   My WordPress blog, I don't have the problem, it's just a checkbox on WordPress.com.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.520]   So I have that there.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.760]   And a lot of the sites I use, there's really only this one site, this old tech guy site.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.400]   But I fear it's going to cost me tens of thousands of dollars to go back,
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.600]   get that site recoded.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.280]   Just sell one of your five Teslas.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.280]   I bought those things, they're expensive.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.160]   By the way, very little resale money value on Teslas.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:16.560]   They go...
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:16.960]   Oh, man.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.080]   They depreciate really quick.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.080]   I don't know why.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.200]   Where's that used Tesla market?
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:21.760]   I need that.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:22.960]   I think the opposite.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.760]   Maybe not, I don't know, I was just assuming that.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.760]   Because I don't want to sell it.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.800]   I do know, this does not make sense.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.480]   I pay more for insurance on the Tesla.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.080]   My deductible is $5,000.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.560]   Because the insurance company said, are you going to ever use autopilot?
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.080]   And I said, well, yeah.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.480]   And in my opinion...
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.760]   Got a lie, man.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.240]   What do you do?
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.840]   Well, but in my opinion, that's better.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.560]   I'm less likely to have a crash using auto...
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.760]   I mean, I'm not going to snooze while I'm using autopilot.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.280]   I'm not going to drive home drunk.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:58.240]   So insurance companies are paid to have opinions
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.000]   that are more accurate than yours.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:00.480]   Am I?
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.040]   That's...
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:01.520]   I know.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.720]   I have heard otherwise, though, that some insurance companies will give you a discount
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.920]   if you use autopilot.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.000]   And ultimately, won't self-driving cars be better for insurance?
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.040]   I thought, maybe not.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.480]   Maybe not.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.440]   You'd think so.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.920]   But yeah, we're still trying to figure out who's to blame,
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.160]   if there's an accident or anything.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.720]   I do wonder if insurance companies will be smart enough to tell.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.680]   Like, if your car has all these sensors and can, you know,
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.760]   keep you in the lane, things like that.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.720]   Do you get a detector or do you get like a lower rate?
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.360]   I should.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.840]   I've stayed out of an accident because it sees a car that...
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.720]   I mean, I haven't re-rendered people that I might have,
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.080]   because the car says, "Wait a minute.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.160]   You're closing on that car too fast.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.560]   It beeps, it pretenses, the seatbelts,
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.440]   starts braking.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.000]   It does all sorts of stuff that prevent me from hitting that guy.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.320]   I feel like that should give me a discount, but no.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.600]   No.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.280]   But if somebody slams into you and takes out the front of your car,
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.720]   replacing all of that...
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.600]   That's expensive.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.040]   Electronics is expensive.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.560]   So, and you know, that's...
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.640]   Maybe that's why it's an expensive car up here.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.680]   It's an expensive car.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:02.560]   That's the...
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.160]   That's you.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.280]   All right, enough ranting.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.200]   I'm ranting about a world is...
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:07.840]   I'm mad.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:08.320]   I'm mad.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.040]   I tell you.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.920]   So Microsoft's going to do the same thing with Edge and Internet Explorer.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.840]   They're going to start a warning.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.440]   I think they said this a year ago,
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.360]   and they've given us some warning about this.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.840]   Does anyone use Safari anymore on the desktops?
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.280]   I think Mac users, you're sitting there with the hot,
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.960]   shut new Mac book.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:27.840]   Don't you use Safari?
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.800]   It's better battery life.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.400]   Sometimes I use Safari when I'm forced to.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.040]   Like there's a certain website that only works with Safari,
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.120]   but like the Apple earnings.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:35.680]   I'm using it.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.080]   Believe it or not, Edge, you'll be proud of me.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:38.960]   Yeah, the Apple earnings.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.040]   It won't stream anything if you're not using Safari.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:41.840]   Edge, you'll be proud of me.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.800]   I'm using Edge right now.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.600]   It's a very good browser.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.960]   And one reason that...
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.680]   You know, there's an interesting story this week,
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.680]   this week or last week,
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.480]   Slack, right?
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.720]   Which said they're only supporting Chrome.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.520]   What?
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.480]   In the browser.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.520]   You didn't hear about that?
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.200]   I should have put it in show notes.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.360]   The, yeah, Slack officially only supports Chrome.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:09.600]   And this is one of the reasons I have a MacBook Pro next to me here.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.360]   I use Safari on it.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.560]   I have several Windows 10 machines here.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.880]   I use Edge on them because that's the browser
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.320]   that was designed for use with the operating system.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.200]   And both of those have a usage share of about 25%,
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:32.160]   20 to 25% in their respective segments.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.840]   But there's something really important about that 20 or 25%
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.200]   is that it keeps us from having yet another monoculture.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.720]   You know?
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.200]   Yes.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.520]   And the people who screamed and yelled about correctly,
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.440]   as it turns out, about the Windows monoculture
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:57.440]   are distressingly silent about the Google Chrome monoculture.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.000]   And I run into so many sites that say,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.920]   you know, this site best viewed in Chrome,
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.440]   basically is what they're saying.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.280]   And that's exactly what Slack did.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.280]   And it drives me nuts.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.200]   It's crazy.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.840]   Like Chrome is a crazy piece of software now too.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.320]   Like you just go look at your resource manager or whatever.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:19.280]   For some reason, Chrome will be using gigabytes of, you know, RAM for no reason.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.920]   Like it is pretty crazy.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.800]   I've been using the new Firefox and they rebuilt that engine.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.240]   It's actually pretty great and really not too memory intensive either.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.160]   So Slack is a little bit of a different story because it has apps.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.040]   So you don't have to use the browser.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.720]   Is this, do they have an app for the desktop?
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.400]   Yeah, they have an app for desktop.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.880]   So they do give you an option to use the Slack app.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.800]   This is only if you're just going to use a browser.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:52.320]   But the point is if you're going to deliver a service that is designed to run in a browser,
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.880]   then make it run in any browser.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.400]   Make it run in any browser.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:02.000]   Make it run in any browser in any modern standards compliant browser.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:11.920]   Microsoft with Edge, Mozilla with Firefox, Google with Chrome, and even Opera with Vivaldi.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.760]   Is that what they're calling it now?
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:24.720]   The all of those organizations have spent many, many tens of thousands of developer years
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.880]   making their product standards compliant.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:36.000]   And it's laziness and it's bad for the makers of services to say,
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.920]   "Sorry, we're only going to support one browser.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.560]   We're not going to do the work of ensuring that we're supporting the standards."
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.360]   What you wind up with is in fact that Chrome introduces a new feature and everyone says,
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.680]   "Oh, Chrome has a new feature. That's a standard."
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.520]   It's not. It's a Chrome feature.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.920]   Well, Internet Explorer was for years, right?
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.840]   The standard that people wrote to.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:04.160]   I tell you, people who web front ends hate that they want a mono culture.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.840]   They hate it. They have to develop for every browser a unique stop.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.720]   But that's not true anymore.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.960]   It used to be true with Internet Explorer.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.800]   And now there are good, solid, recognized standards around you can do.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.400]   It's a very, very simple feature detection.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.520]   That's all you have to do.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.600]   Does this browser support this feature?
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.040]   No, then change your path.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:38.080]   You don't have to do entire branches of code to support a different browser because it's different.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:45.040]   Like I said, they all did the work to support the W3C standards.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:51.200]   And yet what's happening is that Chrome is becoming the new Internet Explorer.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.480]   Yeah, dominant, totally dominant.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.320]   I'm completely with you, Ed.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.280]   A mono culture is bad for bananas and it's bad for browsers.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.080]   And by the way, banana crisis.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.480]   Banana crisis coming soon.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.160]   Do you like bananas? You better enjoy all the bananas you can right now.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.920]   There's a banana bite.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.360]   Well, the amazing story is there was one.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.320]   And the problem is it gets in the ground.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.200]   Where did I read this?
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:21.920]   Do you read it too?
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.720]   It gets in the ground and initially banana growers,
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.560]   because there was only one strain everybody used.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.920]   They would move their plantation.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.480]   But eventually everywhere in the world had this bug.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.680]   But then some guy found one new banana strain that was immune.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.560]   So they planted that everywhere and now it's getting bit by the bug.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.720]   That's all I ever eat for breakfast is bananas.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.560]   I knew that about you, Brian.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:46.960]   God.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.160]   Now, did you know this?
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.440]   What a shock.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.360]   We've all been talking about the Pixel 2 XL and how it had a secret hidden chip in the Pixel 2
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.920]   that was a visual core that Google didn't even turn on initially.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.880]   And then they turned it on with Android 8.1.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.360]   Suddenly your HDR pictures were better than ever, except
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:14.400]   Rana Madio said, "Google sent along a note saying the Pixel visual core is actually not used by the camera."
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.760]   What?
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:18.480]   But she nerds.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.280]   You're all wrong.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.800]   What?
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.920]   Did you know that, Brian?
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.760]   No, I actually didn't know any of this stuff.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.680]   This is like a big deal.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.760]   I kept saying, "Oh, this camera is so good.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:32.400]   You know why? It has a dedicated DSP and they hit it in the phone and nothing used."
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.440]   Well, it turns out the first apps that are going to use it are not Google,
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.600]   but Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.440]   In the developer preview of Android 8.1 and Ron, like me, like everybody else,
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.400]   we thought, "Oh, that visual core that's being used right by Google's app."
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.280]   It's to run ads.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.640]   That's like the battery so much.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.520]   Geek folklore.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.280]   But why?
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.480]   Why didn't they use the real thing?
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.360]   What's going on?
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.960]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.920]   Come on, Google.
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.800]   I feel like every tech company, I look at what they're doing,
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.680]   and I'm just shaking my head.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.280]   Like, it's some dumb thing, basically.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.960]   They know something that we don't.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.920]   Is that it, Devindra?
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.160]   Like, if we had perfect information, we'd do exactly the same dumb thing they're doing.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:12.000]   I mean, I don't know why they'd build something and not use it,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.720]   because it costs money to put that thing in the phones.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.000]   Bull--
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.440]   Look at Google's Messenger strategy for Amazon.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:19.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.240]   Explain that to me, Google.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:22.720]   Is there one?
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.760]   I think they're very bad at products.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:28.080]   Well, there may be, because now they--
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:28.720]   I think it was--
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:33.280]   One of the Android blogs looked at the source code
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.200]   of the upcoming Google Messages app,
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.520]   and it's going to have a desktop--
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.600]   may have a desktop component, finally,
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.800]   which would finally--
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.480]   I mean, the reason I keep using Hangouts
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.680]   is because I can use Hangouts on the desktop and on my phone.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.800]   And if I have Hangouts enabled, I have multiple phones.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:56.160]   This is an unusual use case, but I think all of us share this problem.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.040]   Hangouts will mean I can get that message everywhere.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.560]   Google's Messages doesn't work that way.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:03.520]   And then--
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.000]   But it supports RCS, which is a new standard that Google would love the carriers to adopt.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.760]   The carriers say, screw you, Google.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.440]   And so they have that, then there's Aloe.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.200]   Nobody uses it.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.600]   Nobody uses it, because it doesn't support SMS.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.440]   And then--
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.400]   I mean, it's--
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.320]   But I feel like it might be because they don't want to piss off the carriers.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.320]   Google's done this before, right, with Android.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.160]   They could have made better hardware, but they were afraid
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.080]   that the Android--
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:38.400]   that people like Samsung LG would pull out of the Android ecosystem.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.080]   Now they're fighting harder on that.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.520]   Now they say, we want to win great profile of Rick Osterlo,
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.880]   who is now kind of even more important at Google.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.280]   He's in charge of Google hardware.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.560]   And Rick is-- he's the senior vice president of hardware.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.640]   And now he will be running the Nest Group as well,
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.960]   which has been moved out of Alphabet and into adult supervision.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.960]   I think needs some help, Nest.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.520]   They haven't really done anything interesting in, like, say, three years or something.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:08.640]   This has--
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.680]   It's been a while.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.000]   This is Wired magazine's profile.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.120]   Boy, that's a big picture.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:13.520]   I've met Rick.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.160]   He's a nice guy.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:14.640]   Oh, crap.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.880]   I'm running up against Wired's new paywall.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.160]   No.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.600]   You got to pay $5 for a year.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.400]   Is that all it is?
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.840]   Is that what it is?
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.640]   Yeah, it's something like that.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.160]   See, it's funny, because I didn't even look.
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.240]   I just, on principle, I don't want to pay for that.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.920]   It's only $5.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.560]   That's not bad.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.240]   I seem to already subscribing, Leo.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:32.880]   So--
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.960]   To Wired in general.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.120]   Oh, if you subscribe to the magazine, you don't have to pay for it.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:39.840]   OK.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.240]   Yeah, I really--
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:42.880]   That's true.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.480]   Because that hasn't been true for me.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.160]   I've been a subscriber to the magazine.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.920]   There for the longest time, they didn't give me access to the website.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.280]   I guess I need to go look at it again.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.640]   Maybe figure out how to sign in.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.000]   But I found it--
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.760]   The thing that I found annoying was that--
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.160]   20 was--
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:58.640]   20 was a month.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:20:59.760]   Paying them.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.560]   20 years.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.040]   20 a year.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:01.520]   20 a year.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.000]   My bad.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:02.320]   Sorry.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.280]   It's still--
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:04.800]   $5.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.280]   A quarter.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:11.120]   But yeah, you know, I pay for a subscription to the magazine.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:16.000]   But the website, at least for a while, it was on a different system.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.520]   Maybe I'll go back and look at it again.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.240]   It looks like it is.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.000]   There's the digital-only subscription,
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.920]   which gives you unlimited access to Wired.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.160]   Add free browsing of print subscription as well,
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   which I don't want.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:26.960]   Because I've got--
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:27.520]   You know, I'm good.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.240]   I have texture.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:28.880]   I don't need it.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.320]   Is this going to work for them, you think?
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.640]   I mean, the New Yorker has a paywall.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.120]   Right?
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.360]   Yeah, but I subscribed to New Yorkers, so I don't care.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:35.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.000]   But you're right.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.840]   I think this is a bad idea in general.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.040]   But I have to say, Wired Online has really beefed up
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.120]   their content.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.640]   And they've branched out a little bit.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.440]   They're doing a lot of coverage of other stuff,
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:50.240]   besides pure tech stuff.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.920]   I mean, as a person who used to work there,
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.480]   I feel like they used to do a lot of aggregation
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.280]   and not so much original content.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.680]   But I think there's more of a focus on the original stuff now, right?
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.440]   But here's an article why it's almost impossible to do a quintuple jump in skating.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.920]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.680]   So I think they're aggregating much at all anymore.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.360]   I think they've got a lot of original content.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.640]   It's probably very expensive.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.760]   They only want 20 bucks, so you're right, I'm going to pay for it now.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.640]   I mean, I pay for a lot.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.480]   I pay for Paul Therat.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.600]   I mean, I should pay for this.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:28.320]   Well, and this is another problem that you talk about,
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.560]   the conversation that you had with Vince Serf.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:37.440]   I think if we could all go back to the beginning of the web
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:43.120]   and redesign it, we would redesign it so that it could be monetized
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:49.600]   in some way other than really crappy banner ads and popovers
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:55.440]   and auto play videos and things like that.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:00.720]   We have become so accustomed to everything being free
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:07.760]   that the knee jerk reaction is, I'm not paying for anything.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:12.800]   Now, the good news is that sites like the New York Times and the Washington Post
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.160]   seem to be doing very well.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:18.320]   Boy, the New York Times, congratulations.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.040]   What do they say? Almost a billion dollars in subscription fees?
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.480]   Yeah, yeah, that sounds about right.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.280]   That's exciting.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.280]   I mean, that means people value good journalism.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:34.160]   I'm not sure the Post is doing equally well under the able helming of Jeff Bezos.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.040]   Yeah, then you get discount with your prime too.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.360]   It's definitely good news when we're more supported by subscriptions and advertisements.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.920]   Although, I forget how much is advertising for revenue, but a billion is significant.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.280]   Yeah, yeah, not with those not.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:53.280]   And then there's sites like TalkingPointsMemo.com, Josh Marshall's site,
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:01.440]   where they have sort of a hybrid model there and you can read anything you want for free.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:08.880]   But if you subscribe, I think for 50 bucks a year, you get a site that is considerably less
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:17.600]   annoying. It doesn't have those ads. You still get a few ads, but most of the ads are pretty clean.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.760]   And the site is much easier to navigate.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:28.480]   And ultimately, I've come down to, I now pay 10 or 15 different
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:36.960]   applications precisely because I want to encourage that kind of business model.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:43.760]   And I actively stay away from sites that don't have any kind of option like that.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:49.520]   CNN has autoplay videos on every single page.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:54.720]   And so if I see a CNN link, I think twice.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:01.520]   It's a dangerous thing. There are some tech sites that I think go really, really overboard with
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.480]   the autoplay video and the sound. That's the thing.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.400]   First up, you've got to be sound.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.920]   I want to say.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.240]   Oh, man. It's tough. But I honestly don't know.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:19.040]   Do you think there was something notable about the idea of having this free platform for information?
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:23.760]   And I wonder if we started monetizing it earlier in a very efficient way, would that have
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.640]   slowed any of the innovation down or anything?
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.160]   Do you think micro payments, some sort of micro-pandence, was what we needed?
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.040]   Is that the solution that should have been implemented?
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.480]   I mean, it's all moot now because we didn't do it.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.960]   But clearly, there's a problem.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.400]   I mean, I don't know what the percentage of people using ad blockers is now.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.920]   I would say the percentage of people using ad blockers who listen to this show is very high.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.280]   Very high.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.920]   I mean, it's sad that that's become a general recommendation that we have to use an ad blocker
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:56.720]   now because otherwise your battery gets sucked by these ad trackers and everything.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.480]   Malware.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.760]   We're serving up malware in ads on YouTube.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.320]   Which is not their intention, but that's just how advertising networks work.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.280]   Because they're automatic.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.640]   We're all kind of in a bad situation where you just have to block ads.
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:15.600]   And yet, I as much or maybe more than anybody believe that you need to monetize
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.600]   great content and needs to be paid for.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:21.600]   It's I believe I know how much we have a payroll in excess of a million dollars a year.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.880]   That's not coming.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.920]   I can't pay that.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.120]   I can't come out of my pocket.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.600]   So let me do an ad.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.960]   By fewer Teslas, Lee.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.040]   That's you know, people say that all the time.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:41.200]   Leo, if you took time off, if you didn't buy stuff, you could have more shows.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.040]   It's like, I'm not going to give up my life so that doesn't make sense.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.680]   True.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.440]   Please say yes.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.560]   You know what I say?
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.280]   I say, no, then I'll come.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.880]   I make a lot of money on the radio show.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.760]   This has come out of Twit.
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.360]   It comes out of the radio show.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.040]   I don't know.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.200]   It's not okay.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.440]   Yes, I could make less money.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.840]   Oh, look, my doorbell is finally ringing.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.800]   I left that on hoping it would.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.640]   But we've already done the ring end.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.200]   But I think it's not unreasonable no matter what the business is.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.560]   Yes, I know.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.760]   Now the doorbell is really going to turn us on.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.160]   It's not unreasonable no matter what the business to say.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.000]   Look, it's fair for a business to have to pay its bills.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.160]   I don't care if it's Google or Facebook, you know, you've got to pay the bills.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:38.080]   Now, I may not agree with how Facebook monetizes or, but I understand it needs to monetize.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.960]   And I see people all the time who want to use these services for free.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.320]   And I say that I think you're free riding on something.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.760]   You use it's a service across money.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.720]   You're free riding.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.080]   You I think that's unethical.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.200]   So anyway, I just paid for wired 20 bucks.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:51.920]   It was worth it.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.560]   There you go.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.400]   You're down your credit card number when you're typing it.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:54.720]   Did you?
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.800]   So you know it's happened.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.680]   Find me a Tesla.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.720]   I okay.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:27:59.120]   Go ahead.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:27:59.760]   Good luck.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.360]   I don't think that that the limit on that.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.320]   There's your episode title.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.480]   Thanks for buying me to Tesla.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.640]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:18.000]   Actually, I used fresh books when they first started out in the mid 2000s to do invoices.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.200]   I hated doing invoicing.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.120]   If you're, you know, if you have a, what do they call it?
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.560]   A side gig.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.960]   If you have, if you have a side hustle, a passion project, if you're a freelancer,
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.440]   you know that you're doing something you love.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.040]   I love doing what I was doing.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.160]   I was going up to Canada and doing a call for help up there.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:41.040]   But the thing I hated was the bookkeeping, the paperwork at the end of the month.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:44.480]   I'd have to send out bills and, but you find out if you don't do that part,
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.200]   you don't get paid.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.320]   And that is kind of important.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.600]   So fresh books saved my life in that respect.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.280]   I was able to create professional looking invoices quickly.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.320]   Fresh books invoices have a very nice feature, a pay me button on there.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.240]   It turns out your clients will pay you faster if you make it easier for them.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.560]   You can all of a sudden just by using fresh books,
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.440]   except credit card payments directly from the invoice.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.000]   So you don't have to get checks mailed to you and wait in line in the bank to deposit them.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.920]   You don't have to chase clients for payments.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.760]   In fact, it turns out because of this, because you can accept credit cards,
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.680]   there's a pay me button, you'll get paid on average twice as fast.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.000]   Plus fresh books by virtue of doing the invoices,
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.640]   the accounts receivable, you track expenses.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.520]   They're actually doing your books for you.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.440]   You can go to the Fresh Books dashboard.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.600]   This new redesigned aspect is great.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.120]   And no, at any moment as a freelancer, whether you're making money, are you making a profit?
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.560]   And when tax season comes around, it's just a month off.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.240]   Now you'll be ready.
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:50.000]   You'll have all the reports you need to do your taxes effectively and quickly and easily.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.920]   You can create proposals now in Fresh Books.
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:53.360]   They always are adding new features.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.200]   This is something they never had when I was using it with rich text content, images,
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.040]   customizable sections.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:02.400]   They make it easy to build for time by client, by project.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:05.120]   You can even have different costs for different projects.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.320]   They automatically connect to your bank account and update expenses from the bank account daily.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.520]   So it's a dashboard to your entire financial life.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.120]   Take a picture of a receipt, upload it.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.120]   Fresh books will do the rest, put it right in there.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.280]   From payment reminders to late fees, you can automate as much as you want or as little as you want.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.200]   Get back to doing what you love.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.960]   Make that side hustle a full-time gig with Fresh Books.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.800]   Make this year your most productive year yet.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.880]   You'll be ready when tax time comes along and you'll be set up for success
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:33.920]   when you use Fresh Books.

[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.600]   FreshBooks.com/Twit.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.840]   Enter this week in tech if you would when they ask you,
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:40.880]   "How did you hear about us?"
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.400]   That great support team in Canada.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.080]   Really nice people.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:48.400]   FreshBooks.com/Twit.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.520]   You know who's not making money anymore on ads?
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.320]   Logan Paul.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:59.520]   Google has pulled his ad revenue because even after the suicide video,
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:05.360]   this is a YouTube star who appalled everybody by showing a dead body from the Japanese,
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.720]   you know, that suicide forest.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.880]   Then apparently he's been doing more bad stuff.
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.640]   To dead bodies of animals.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:13.680]   No, really?
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.280]   Yeah, he's teasing a dead hamster or something.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.360]   Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.200]   Is it a dead rat or a dead hamster?
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.000]   Yeah, one of those.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.440]   Firing a rifle at dead rats or something.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.600]   I mean, just throw this guy into a volcano.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.320]   And livestream it.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.000]   That is the ultimate conclusion.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.680]   Yeah, I love streaming.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:40.560]   He was he the guy who encouraged his followers to eat tidepods?
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.520]   That's where that started.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.560]   There is that too.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.080]   That's horrible.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.080]   So his audience is like, "How old are they?"
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.760]   They're impressionable 14 year olds, right?
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.400]   That's sad.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:48.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:49.600]   How old is he?
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.440]   I don't know.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.920]   I think he's like 18 years old.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.160]   I mean, his brother and his, I think it's his younger brother,
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.680]   has like a really young following.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.160]   He's really, really weird.
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.120]   I don't know.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:05.280]   Social Blade, which does predict how much people make on YouTube,
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.200]   estimates he earns more than a million a month in ad revenue.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.440]   So this is a big, now it's a temporary ban,
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.760]   but nevertheless, you take away a million,
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.760]   1.2 million a month from somebody.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.280]   They're going to sit up and take notice.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.800]   At the same time, I feel like YouTube is completely complicit in this.
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.600]   Oh yeah.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.880]   This is how you succeed on YouTube by getting increasingly outrageous, right?
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.960]   I mean, it's like their hands have been caught in the cookie jars,
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.800]   so we have to act on it now, right?
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.520]   They've been supporting Logan Paul for this long.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:38.400]   Suddenly, there's a PR nightmare and they have to do something with school D.S.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:42.720]   So it's PR and it's temporary because YouTube gets a big cut of that.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.880]   We don't know how much, but if Logan's making a million,
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.000]   they're probably making two or three.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.600]   And it's strange that it's a temporary suspension.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.320]   So when do you decide to bring him back if he's teasing dead rats
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.320]   and showing dead bodies on the internet?
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:02.960]   Don't really get how you come back from that, but advertising.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.280]   There was something very similar that happened a few months ago,
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:16.880]   where there was a group of YouTube, not stars, but content producers,
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:24.240]   let's call them, who were doing it, and mostly parents doing funny things with their kids.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:34.080]   Making them edgier and edgier and it turned down that they were rewarding engagement from an audience
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.400]   of pedophiles, basically.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:43.920]   So then all of a sudden, what happened was that Google just automatically shut off
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:49.280]   the ad revenue spigot for all of these content creators with no warning.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:55.520]   So they had been making $100,000 or more a month each.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:01.360]   And then all of a sudden, with no warning, Google says, "Sorry, your channel's dead.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.840]   You're going to zero."
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:10.800]   And we're back to this is a theme that has come up again and again.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.200]   This was completely predictable.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:22.960]   Anybody who sat down and thought about the impact of algorithms on human behavior
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:32.640]   and rewarded by big money could have just drawn the little trend line there and said,
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.920]   "Here's where it ends."
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:40.400]   And then if you think about that at the beginning, these problems, you're prepared to deal with these
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.200]   problems. But instead, we just seem to be going over and over again to the,
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:52.480]   "Oh, gee, no idea how that happened. We'll shut him down until we figure it out."
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:58.640]   And the fact that it just keeps happening is disturbing.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:06.400]   This is what happens in TV too though, right? Sensationalism breeds sensationalism because
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:12.560]   what was once sensational is no longer driving traffic, so you have to ramp it up, amp it up.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:18.720]   The only difference is, I think it's actually advertisers that keep the lid on that and broadcast
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:25.200]   anyway, because only so far you can go. Although over time, we certainly have gotten more and more
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.040]   sensationalistic. I remember more.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:30.560]   There is the FCC and there's a lot of standard groups and things like that.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.800]   YouTube is just the wild west.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.720]   Nobody's putting any pressure on YouTube at all, really.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.680]   Recently, I was thinking to myself, "So people are eating tide pods. This guy's shooting
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:46.800]   scissors at rats. And some lady just flushed her hamster down the toilet."
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.600]   That's the saddest story I ever saw in my life.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:53.600]   The airplane. And I thought, "Is the world just ending right now?"
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.600]   Yeah, this is the end of the year.
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.800]   The end times.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:02.080]   All led to this. It's the year 2018 and all this is happening at the same time.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.840]   I just was really bleak.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.720]   So this is nature's response. I can't blame it too.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.040]   So.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.840]   I was not in the darkest timeline.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.600]   We're in the darkest timeline.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:16.320]   Something happened. Somehow we got sucked into the wrong timeline.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:16.800]   Can I go back?
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.560]   I blamed the large Hadron Collider.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.120]   That's it.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:19.360]   I will.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:19.920]   That's it.
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.120]   The Higgs boson.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.680]   It's we should never have sought the Higgs.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:28.960]   So I think this still feels like a bogus story.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.200]   Yeah, it sounds like a fake news story, right?
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.480]   It doesn't sound possible.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:39.200]   Spirit airlines, among other airlines, have been cracking down on companion animals.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:45.200]   That a lot of people bringing animals of all kinds on because they're nervous fliers or whatever.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.320]   A college kid brought her hamster on.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.960]   Apparently a flight attendant had been having a bad day,
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.920]   told her to flush her emotional support hamster down the toilet.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.920]   And the girl, for some reason, did it.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.320]   No loyalty today.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.800]   It feels like this is a fake news story.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.440]   First of all, I'm sorry.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.240]   I can't believe that this is true in any aspect.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.280]   I don't believe for a second that an employee told her to flush the hamster down the toilet.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.640]   She's trying to sue now.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:17.680]   I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:20.160]   For one thing that would probably clog the toilet.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.920]   So from a most practical point of view,
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.280]   no one's ever going to tell someone to do that on a plane, right?
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.840]   But she obviously flushed her hamster down the toilet
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.240]   and she wants to blame somebody else and get some money out of it.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:32.240]   That's, I mean, if she even had it.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.480]   If she asked her twice whether she could bring pebbles on the plane,
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.960]   pebbles is the hamster.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:37.360]   Right.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.120]   Just in case you're clear.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:39.520]   Just a few reviews.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.000]   And the spirits had twice.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:42.960]   She checked with the airline.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:46.560]   She brought along paperwork that said this is an emotional support animal.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.800]   But another employee said you can't bring it on board.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.320]   She got on the plane.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:56.720]   She told the Miami Herald she was hours from friends who could help,
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.760]   wasn't able to rent a car.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:00.000]   Taking a Graham bus would take days.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.640]   So the spirit animal suggested that she let pebbles go outside or flush her down the toilet.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:10.080]   I guess they hadn't taken off yet.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.200]   So she thought it'd be inhumane to let the animal outside.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.040]   That's inhumane.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:17.200]   So she drowned in a toilet.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:21.840]   This has got to be fake news.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.480]   By the way, good news.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.000]   She's got a replacement rodent.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:33.360]   It has nothing to do with tech, but you brought it up and I got to mention it because it can't be real.
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.080]   Maybe you tell the replacement.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:36.640]   It's your timeline.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.760]   I just don't understand it.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.440]   Then there's the story.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.960]   And by the way, tell Nellie Bowles.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:41.520]   I love her.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.720]   She's good.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:43.760]   She's great.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.000]   In fact, if you could just tell her how nice it is up here.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:46.560]   Well, deal.
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.760]   She could come up sometime.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.440]   Maybe you could come up together.
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.000]   Sure.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.920]   She's in the San Francisco office right at the New York time.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.880]   Yeah, she could hit you right.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:53.920]   She just hit you right with you.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.600]   Great story about, and this is another weird one.
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:04.240]   Early Facebook and Google employees have formed a coalition to fight the ill effect of
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:12.480]   Facebook and Google, the Center for Humane Technology, plans an anti-tech addiction lobbying
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.840]   effort. These guys apparently felt guilty.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:24.800]   They funded a campaign called The Truth About Tech with $7 million, plus $50 million
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.880]   in donated media and airtime from who?
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:28.080]   Comcast, of course.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.240]   The Truth About Tech.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.360]   Watch more TV.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.560]   Don't use your computer and direct TV.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.840]   Former in-house ethicist at Google Tristan Harris said,
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.400]   "We were on the inside.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.240]   We know what the companies measure.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.680]   We know how they talk.
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.840]   We know how the engineering works.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:49.440]   They're bad, bad people.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.400]   No, I added that part."
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.640]   Is this weird?
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.160]   So to back up, this whole conversation about addiction started out with an Apple investor,
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:03.120]   or two Apple investors who are $1 billion or something investors,
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.800]   saying that there's an addiction issue with smartphones and-
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.760]   I should look into this.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:08.720]   I do see that.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:09.280]   I do see that.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.040]   Apple agreed.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:17.760]   Yeah, but sure, these are some rich investors, but why are we talking about this now?
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.440]   Hasn't this been an issue for a while? Or also, is there a reason that this is more prominent,
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.600]   or more of a serious issue now than before?
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:26.720]   That's kind of my question.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:32.080]   It seems like addiction should have been something that we should have been talking about for the past decade.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.840]   Chama Palahapatiya, who was an early employee at Facebook and is now a venture capitalist.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.320]   Yeah, I wonder where the money came from.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.560]   Said that Facebook is ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.760]   Now that I got mine, it's just-
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:52.480]   It's not just addiction though.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.120]   It didn't just start with the Apple shareholders, even before then.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.800]   Who was it? Was it Sean Fanning who said, "I see what Facebook's doing to children,
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:04.640]   and it's just terrible." I mean, this has been going on for a year now.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:04.960]   Okay.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.080]   Yeah, the elections, I'm not surprised.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.520]   Now's the time where we're seeing the reckoning of Big Tech on society.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.120]   So yeah, this is a response.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:17.120]   No one's really offering a great solution among the tech companies, right?
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:21.760]   So parental controls on both Apple and Android are still not that great, right?
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:26.400]   They don't really control very many features of the phone to regulate a kid's usage of the phones.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.440]   I don't really feel like there's-
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.080]   I mean, there's a conversation, but there's a great solution coming out of this.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.120]   Sean Fanning.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.520]   Sean Parker said, "God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.160]   God only knows. God doesn't know."
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:43.200]   Tim Cook said he wouldn't let his nephew on social media.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:47.040]   Steve Jobs famously wouldn't let his kids have iPads.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:47.360]   Right.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:51.280]   But yeah, this is what we're talking about with YouTube and the algorithms, right?
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:53.120]   Like they weren't thinking about this.
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.720]   They just wanted to build the biggest video platform in the world and not think about the
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:01.680]   consequences. So I think there's definitely room for a group that maybe does some of that,
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:07.280]   or at least raises questions that having covered startups for a long time,
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.400]   the tech companies do not ask some of these questions.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.360]   They just want the numbers. They want the users and they want the stats.
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.360]   They don't care how it's being used.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:18.880]   And for a long time, I poo-pooed the notion of internet addiction.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:22.000]   I thought that was just techno panic and so forth.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.800]   But I think it's pretty clear. You see people walking around,
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.360]   walking into traffic, looking at their phone all the time.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.840]   You see families at a restaurant, go to a restaurant sometime and see,
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.880]   nobody's talking to each other. They're all looking at their phone the whole time.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:39.600]   So clearly, there is something going on. And it's also clear that these companies are willing
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:45.760]   to, in effect, weaponize their engagement strategies, Facebook, of course, and others,
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:53.200]   where they get the data. They know what makes people spend more time on the news feed.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.920]   Well, whatever that is, let's up that. Let's turn that knob up.
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.400]   And as a result, you get something that actually really is literally addictive.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:04.000]   Well, and you just nailed it. You just nailed it right there.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:13.200]   You know, there is money to be made by amplifying the bad behavior.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:20.640]   There is nothing but cost in regulating the bad behavior.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:28.400]   You have a double whammy for any large tech company that tries to build the proper kind of
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:36.000]   parental controls and social controls into their software. Number one, it takes resources away,
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.960]   development resources away from the features that are making them all the money.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:48.560]   So, you know, and developers are a scarce resource. And then number two, it reduces engagement.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:54.800]   It reduces the monetization opportunities. And so I think you're going to hear a lot of big tech
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:00.000]   companies paying lip service to all these things. I think Facebook has been particularly good about
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:08.080]   talking about all the wonderful things it's going to do. But from a pure economic standpoint,
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:15.120]   it's like, you know, it's like all the tax money that's coming back or the repatriated profits that
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:21.760]   are coming back here. It's the underlying behavior can't change because the economic incentives
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:27.840]   are not changing. Why would companies do change that? They're not going to change that. Government's
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:31.760]   not going to regulate it. This isn't going to change. It takes something big to happen,
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.800]   like the election, right? Like Mark Zuckerberg's big awakening happened after he realized that
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:43.280]   maybe a foreign power used his own, you know, social network to trick the American public using
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:48.240]   the algorithms and technology that they spent so long building. And what was his solution,
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:53.920]   right? Is that he's going to do his job and pay attention as CEO. And also, I guess, make the
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:59.520]   timeline less influential too, which is really strange. So less news in the timeline because
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:04.800]   they don't know how to manage the accuracy of news in the timeline. Have you guys seen the
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.760]   Android parental controls that came out pretty recently? Like maybe a year ago, I think it was called
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:15.680]   Google Family Link or something. It's actually quite good because you can have very, very detailed
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.760]   controls of a kid's usage of the smartphone. You can turn it off at certain times, turn off the
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:25.360]   Wi-Fi, turn off the cellular, et cetera. But here's the caveat. The kid can turn off the parental
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:33.280]   controls once he turns 13. And that's the age when you don't want them to have unregulated access.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:39.200]   And I asked Google about it and they said, well, legally, people can start signing up for a Google
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.680]   account at the age 13. So at that point, we just graduate them from the parental controls program.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:50.560]   And so they no longer need parental controls. But I'm thinking like once a kid turns 13 is one,
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:53.280]   you want to turn on parental control. So it's totally backwards.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.680]   And you've got to stop them from the tight part.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:00.000]   You probably remember, this is, we've seen this all before, remember everybody was
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.800]   recommending, it was with the internet. And parents were buying filtering software to block
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:12.320]   the internet. And that was the big conversation. 10, 15 years ago, how do I keep my teenager from
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:18.160]   seeing porn on the internet? And there was a teenager, his name was Bennett, I can't remember his last
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:23.440]   name, who created a site called PeaceFire. And I just went to see and still there, peacefire.org,
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.960]   they call it the world's largest distribution network for proxy sites to circumvent internet
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.640]   censorship. But it was really created to circumvent blockers.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.320]   And has not been updated since 1996.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.320]   No, it looks like it, right? In fact, they still have a blocking software FAQ.
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.360]   Wow.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:47.360]   Yeah, how to get around cyber sitter, cyber patrol. And I used to tell parents, dude,
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:51.040]   this information is shared among every kid in high school.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:54.080]   Of course. Don't think you're blocking anything.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:47:00.720]   I imagine it's the same today. Yeah, isn't this funny? It's still here.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:07.600]   I imagine the same thing is going on with these Bennett Hazleton, that's his name.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.320]   And these same things are going on with these parental controls on the Android phones.
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.840]   And I think I read that it's really easy to find porn on YouTube too, right?
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.560]   Really? Yeah. Can you tell me how?
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.120]   YouTube for kids, I think there was a story recently.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.760]   So the kids section where parents were complaining that porn was getting uploaded
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:29.040]   to YouTube for kids. So, a lot of problems.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:36.160]   I mean, Tumblr, which is where a lot of kids and teens are too, like that is a haven for porn.
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:38.800]   It's all crazy. Twitter too, right? Twitter doesn't add.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:42.240]   Twitter's free speech policy extends to adult content, Reddit.
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.880]   Instagram and Facebook have been very aggressive about preventing that.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:53.040]   Twitter shows its first profit ever this quarter after 11 years and seven months in operation.
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:58.960]   And lots of losses. I love the register. I just always show the register headlines
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:01.040]   because they're so fun. And this photo.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:05.680]   In black, 12 years on, Twitter finally makes a profit from its fire hose of memes
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.840]   and misery. Most of that they made a profit because they cut costs.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.320]   The costs at Twitter was so outrageous.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.400]   So they're not growing the business. They're just cutting the business to cut costs.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.080]   You think their stock was going up? Do you think they're trying to sell it?
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:26.720]   Well, in fact, in fact, their stock was the only one that went up on a day when
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:34.080]   everything was collapsing. Their stock was one of the lesser declines this week.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.320]   But still, everything was down like two and a half, 3%. And Twitter was up 12%.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:44.000]   You can only imagine they probably would have been up 20% if it hadn't been a completely
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:51.520]   down day for the market. But the real question to me with that is, were they cutting
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:49:01.840]   inefficiencies from the business? Or were they simply just slashing and burning with the hope of
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:09.760]   getting a quarter or two to goose the stock price? Because there's a big difference between those
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:15.920]   two things. Twitter told investors in its quarterly report that's reduced expenses by 28%
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:21.120]   year over year. That's got to be a slash in burn. You can't cut costs that much.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.280]   They lay off 28% of the staff or something.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:25.360]   Yeah, but you got to. That's a lot of stuff.
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:31.840]   $91 million profit. First time to have a net income for Twitter.
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:35.760]   I mean, Vine probably costs a lot. When did that happen? When did they kill that?
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:42.320]   Yeah. And Periscope is dying on the vine, speaking of mine, another Twitter acquisition that hasn't
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.320]   been released. Yeah, they have been.
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:49.440]   And that was also a gap profit. Also, they were actually, they didn't make it with the accounting
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:55.920]   generally accepted accounting practices. Yeah, so like real money.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:59.920]   Wow. Take it to the bank.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:06.080]   Wow. Let's talk about security in Adobe Flash Zero Day. It's like the old good old days back in
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:11.920]   the wild. Adobe plans, I think I has Adobe patched it. I think they patched it.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.040]   Yes.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:19.360]   By now. Let's see. Oh, there's so many exciting hacks.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:27.520]   Grammarly had a flawed Chrome extension that exposed user tokens to anybody interested.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.560]   Samsung and Roku's smart TVs vulnerable to hacking. This one comes from an unusual source.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:36.320]   Consumer reports didn't know they were doing pen testing.
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:42.720]   It's kind of a troubling story because when you think about all the smart home stuff,
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:46.800]   we're having right now, like internet connected light bulbs, etc, etc.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:51.840]   You got to think like, do they have security teams making sure that these things have robust
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:55.600]   security or are they just making cool lights that turn on and off with Alexa or whatever?
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:59.680]   And then you look at the TVs and you would think that no one's going to hack a TV,
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.880]   but they could probably turn it into a botnet that takes something down.
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:06.880]   You know, so it's something to think about, right? For smart home stuff in general,
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:11.360]   that they're making cool products, but they probably don't have great security teams.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.560]   Yeah. I mean, it's particularly disturbing like after CES because they're all announcing
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:21.840]   these whole home smart solutions too, right? LG has a whole new smart home thing.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:26.480]   Samsung wants Bixby everywhere. And I'm talking to these companies trying to ask them about security.
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:31.360]   And they don't really know. Like they say, oh, yeah, we always care about security,
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.920]   but there isn't like extra attention being paid to this stuff.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:39.440]   So they tested five different proprietary. Let's see, they did the Samsung,
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:48.560]   Tizen, the LG WebOS TV. They had a TCL TV, which uses Roku, Sony, which uses Android TV.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:55.600]   And they have a new standard for privacy on these devices. And actually, I think maybe this isn't
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:59.840]   vulnerable to hacking is one issue, but they also looked at the fact that many of these devices
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:06.800]   phone home, that they keep track of what you watch. They're sending data back.
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:11.840]   And I think there's a lot of incentive in these manufacturers to collect data about viewing habits.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:17.440]   There's some good money in that. Because their profit margins on the hardware itself are
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:23.600]   vomiting razor thin. And they're just like the PC makers were 10 or 12 years ago,
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:30.240]   they're making nothing on the hardware. And so they would shovel software onto the device and then
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:36.880]   push people to buy it. And because that was where they, that's where they make the money.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:45.280]   But here we are again, with a technology that's being, that's rushing at us at the speed of an
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:55.600]   oncoming train. And it's the adoption curve is, is, you know, as a hockey stick. And nobody's thinking
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:02.800]   about it. So the stuff that we're talking about with YouTube and Facebook and the social media now,
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:08.320]   let's come back in a year or two. And we're going to be having, let's put a pin in it right here.
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:13.680]   We're going to be having this talk about, wow, how come nobody was thinking about the impact of
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:18.880]   all these Internet of Things things, you know, that are all the disaster that's happening
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:26.480]   with the Internet of Things devices out there. It's going to happen. And it's completely foreseeable.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:32.880]   And yet, well, and collecting all this information is a security issue as well as a privacy issue,
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.040]   because in many cases, they're transmitting the information securely. So somebody can
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:42.240]   intercept what you're watching on TV. Yeah, it's not encrypted, usually. Yeah. They also
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:47.280]   found flaws and sets from TCL and Samsung that allowed researchers to turn the volume up. I mean,
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:53.200]   that's not the end of the world. Rapidly cycle through channels open disturbing YouTube content.
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:54:00.160]   Oh, here comes Gozi on your TV or kick the TV off the Wi-Fi network.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:06.240]   So, yeah, so consumer reports is actually doing a good job on this. And I guess
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:10.400]   they carry a lot of weight with consumers. And I think this might have some
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:14.320]   some merit at least getting these TV companies to pay attention.
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:18.320]   But you know, there's an interesting thing here that it, we're going to harken back to
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:26.240]   something we talked about an hour ago, which was about cars and the entertainment systems and cars
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:34.400]   and how a car is going to last, assuming that you don't total it. It's going to last 10, 15,
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:41.840]   20 years. And yet the embedded entertainment system in it is going to be the thing that was
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:47.840]   was shipped with it. The same thing is true with TVs. TVs, you know, they might not last as long
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:53.680]   as they used to, but they still, you know, there's no reason why a TV shouldn't last for seven,
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:55:00.960]   eight, 10 years. And, you know, I had, I got rid of a TV last year that was, that was about nine,
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:10.240]   nine years old. And it had like an Android 2.0 smart TV system in it. And, you know, that thing
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:16.240]   probably wasn't all that hackable because, you know, Android was so terrible back then.
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:22.080]   But the ones that are going out there now, the, you know, the, the, the stuff is not going to be
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:30.080]   updated. The, these man, these TV manufacturers have zero incentive to update the software on
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:36.400]   their devices and to make them more secure. And so what you're doing is you're dumping a bunch of
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:42.560]   stuff out there that's just going to be hideously insecure. And whoops, there it is.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:48.960]   Oh, is that your smart toothbrush?
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:54.960]   This shows me on so long, I feel like it's time to get up and brush right here. No, I'm a
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:02.960]   sponsor. This is, um, this is a quip. Quip makes a toothbrush subscription. This cleans like a
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:09.120]   premium electric brush, like 25 bucks. It's the greatest thing because it does not every,
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.840]   there's not charge rechargeable. It just holds a AAA battery in there. It has a little strip on
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:19.040]   here. You could put it right on the mirror. They send you a new brush heads automatically. So you
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.840]   don't every three months for $5, including free shipping worldwide. So you don't have to remember
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:30.320]   that. No charger, no wires, compact light. It's affordable. And it does a great job of brushing
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:34.640]   your teeth. It's got little rubber bristles around the edge. It's got softer nylon bristles in the
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:40.800]   middle. Does that whole thing or reminding you to, you know, two minutes and you move the quadrant
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:45.360]   every 30 seconds. This is time magazine is one of time magazine's best inventions of the year.
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:51.520]   It's quick. I love this thing. Mm. Brush is $25 starts at $25 comes in four great colors.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:59.840]   I love this patent pending. So in short, it is time to get a fabulous electric toothbrush. You
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.400]   don't need to spend $100 or more. Have you reviewed this yet at the New York Times?
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:09.200]   You should. I'm going to get you. Does it send information about what you ate back to the
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:14.720]   advertisers? There is no internet connection at all. All right. I'll consider it safe.
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:21.280]   I really like it. It's the new electric toothbrush with just the right amount of
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:27.120]   vibration and slimmer design. It's easy to use a fraction of the cost. It's 30 second pulses,
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.960]   guide you to you brush right. They even have a guide that I learned from. I think this is actually
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:38.080]   pretty cool on how to brush your teeth in here. Did you? Okay. First of all, most toothbrush
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:43.200]   companies, you know, in the ads, they show the toothpaste. They show a big thing in the little
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:47.840]   curl at the end of the use. They quips not trying to get you to use more toothpaste. They just
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:53.280]   put a little dabble. Do you just a little pea sized draw dollop on there, which is actually correct.
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.360]   They also say, and I did not know this after you brush your teeth, don't rinse your mouth.
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:03.760]   What? Yes. My whole life. I've been rinsing my mouth. You know why it's got fluoride and you
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.120]   want the fluoride to sink it in your teeth. Are you are you rinsing after brushing?
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:10.640]   Yeah, I'm always rinsing my mouth. Stop, Brian. Look, it says right here in the
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:17.920]   gut and the healthy guide brush twice a day, AM and PM floss. You got a floss, pea sized paste,
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:23.360]   brush gently. A lot of these toothbrushes, these expensive ones are too aggressive. In fact,
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:28.640]   I was using one of my dentist that said, stop. You're going to the enamel is disappearing on your
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:34.960]   teeth. This is perfect. It short strokes every surface, all corners scrub your tongue, wash,
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:39.680]   not rinse. See, it says they're right there. But to get the full effect of your toothpaste,
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:44.000]   do not rinse your mouth, at least not for a little bit. Quip starts at just $25.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:51.120]   But if you go to getquip.com/twit right now, you get your first refill pack free

[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:13.680]   All right. I put my quip away. This don't let anybody else use this. Leo has used this now.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:20.000]   I love how it comes in this thing. This is so great. You get the toothpaste by me.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.880]   A very nice toothpaste. Very affordable. You can polish the chrome on your Tesla.
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:29.920]   Shut up on that. You're giving me such a hard time. You're just jealous and you're
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:35.600]   Prius. You're just jealous. I am. I actually love my Tesla. I really do love my Tesla. It's a
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:41.440]   great car. I secretly love Elon as well. I wish him well. I want him to succeed.
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:47.840]   If he would look for people to go to Mars and not come back, I'm your guy, Elon.
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:55.360]   I'll be your first Martian. What are they saying in the chat room right now? I really...
[01:59:55.360 --> 02:00:02.880]   Spitt and swallow. Fluoride is delicious. It's good for your teeth. Don't drink it.
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:07.040]   Sugar. Send Leo to Mars.
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:15.120]   Patreon is doing a Snapchat-like feed for its artists, a photo and video feed. They say it's
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:20.000]   not going to replace Instagram or Snapchat, but something extra that artists can do. It's an interesting
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:27.120]   branching out for the crowd-sourcing crowd-funding network. I like Patreon. They've had some struggles.
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:33.200]   ESPN is going to do a new subscription app, $5 a month. It will have none of the sports you want.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:41.360]   Can we read Wired Magazine on it? No. No, you can't do it. It's curling. Actually, I watched curling
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:47.360]   the other night and I enjoyed it. It's quite dramatic. Curling is great. I take it all back.
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:53.600]   ESPN pays lots of money for rights to the NFL and the NBA and college football. They're not going to
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:01:00.080]   put that on their new service. ESPN Plus will have, quote, "incremental thousands of hours of live
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:07.440]   programming," but nothing you can see on any other ESPN channel, which means not even curling.
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:15.360]   Not nothing. What kind of weird stuff Zimbabwe and soccer matches? I don't know what it's going to be.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:21.520]   Badminton. You know, don't knock badminton. Waymo.
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:25.920]   I can't watch it on ESPN, so thank goodness for this.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:32.640]   Curling, I'm telling you, curling in 4K you've never seen anything. It's so beautiful. It's a
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:42.960]   beautiful, beautiful sport. Waymo is settling with Uber. Remember, of course, that the lawsuit
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:52.960]   from Google's Autonomous Vehicle Division, Waymo, claimed that Uber employee, whoa,
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:02:01.360]   autoplay video. Stop it. I don't like you. What was his name? Levandowski, right?
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:09.440]   Left Uber and took with him a bunch, I'm sorry, left Google and took with him a bunch of proprietary
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:15.040]   secrets, which he then handed over to Waymo. They've been going back and forth one day of trial.
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:21.040]   One day, this is actually not that unusual, apparently. They just wanted to see if they had the
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:29.520]   guts to take it to the brink. Uber said, "All right, all right." Waymo was asking for half a billion in
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:36.240]   stock. They got 430, I think, something like that. 234, I think.
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:41.840]   Oh, is that all? I thought they got more than that. No, no, no. In fact, it was an end.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:47.280]   Oh, you know what? It depends on its Uber's stocks. It depends on what the--
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:53.840]   On its valuation. So it could range from 153 million to 245 million on how you value Uber.
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:03:00.560]   Right. But the interesting thing is that I think a lot of the employees who came over
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:08.240]   as part of the settlement are going to have their options wiped out because of the settlement.
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:15.760]   And so, Uber's going to wind up making money on the deal. Oh, my God.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:22.480]   Yeah, at the expense of the-- The employees. The acquisition. Yeah. The people, the
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:29.520]   aqua hires. The liberalism. What are you going to do? It's a win-win. It's like Equifax, making
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:35.920]   money on its breach, which they did. And by the way, now that the Consumer Protection Board has
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:42.480]   been dismantled, that's it. No punishment. Nothing going on. Equifax just moves on,
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:48.720]   makes money, and moves on. I love this. In Bloomberg technology, they're talking about the
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:54.160]   Waymo settlement. They interviewed two jurors who sounded disappointed. The trial ended so quickly.
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:57.920]   They were looking forward to hearing from Anthony. It's not going to work. Yeah, right.
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:04.480]   So they wanted to hear from Anthony Lewandowski. So what that tells me is they had jurors who knew
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:10.320]   what was going on, and that's probably Waymo's settled. Oh, crap. These people know who Lewandowski
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:16.160]   is. We're in deep trouble. Hard to get a jury in Silicon Valley that doesn't know what's going on.
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:23.120]   Also, I think it's the new CEO at Uber, Dara Koswashahi, trying to settle old scores and move on.
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:30.160]   Well, he's the new guy. I mean, that's basically you bring him in. He doesn't have to take any--
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:35.520]   I mean this in a good way. He doesn't have to take any personal responsibility for the acts that
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:40.560]   caused this thing to happen. He can be the magnanimous one who says, in fact, that was the big statement
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:46.160]   that they wrote is, we're going to do the right thing here. We're going to make sure that our
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:53.840]   companies can continue to work together. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and close the books on
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:05:00.240]   this unsavory chapter. Let's look ahead. Do you think he's going to turn around, Uber,
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:05.360]   that he's going to put all this stuff behind him and the company? I don't see how.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:17.280]   I honestly don't see how. I'm not talking about the horrible culture that they had there,
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:25.200]   but really just from a pure economic point of view, Uber, from my reading of the financials that
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:35.760]   I've seen, Uber has been losing money because they've been charging far less than they need to
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:41.920]   charge to make a profit, but that was the way to cripple the taxi companies.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:50.400]   The argument that you always got from people was, well, once self-driving cars come along,
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:55.280]   costs will drop in automatically. We'll make it up in every ride, but we'll make it up in volume.
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:06:03.840]   I think we already see from the pace of the technology that it is not proceeding. It's not
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:13.120]   coming fast enough, and there's going to be a crunch at some point, a big financial crunch there,
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:16.880]   and the question will it be before or after they go public?
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:24.320]   Do you guys still use Uber? Any of you? No. It's very rarely. I use Lyft instead.
[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:30.480]   Yeah. I use Lyft, and I think from a consumer point of view, it's just a better app than Uber.
[02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:33.920]   Yeah, interesting. I think consumers just think they're interchangeable, don't they?
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:39.680]   I mean, it's a better interface. It's if like, find where you are and that kind of thing, and adding
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:44.880]   tip is easier. I just use Uber out of, I really shouldn't. I know I'm not supposed to, and I feel
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:50.160]   bad, but it's inertia. I just have Uber set up, and it's got a credit card. I'll set up Lyft.
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:54.320]   I really shouldn't. Yeah, just delete the Uber app. It's easy, but honestly, even Lyft and all these
[02:06:54.320 --> 02:07:01.200]   taxis have the same problem, right? It's the same thing. They're undercutting pricing. I was in LA
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:06.720]   last year. It's crazy how cheap Lyft is compared to a normal cab, and who knows how long this
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:10.640]   means it's subsidized. And you're not, as to your point of view, they have to compete with
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:16.640]   their pricing to compete with Uber, and Uber is pricing to undercut taxis. And so,
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:21.920]   it's this big giant shell game, and when you pick up the shell, there's nothing underneath it,
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:29.200]   which is, I guess it's great. There's that theme again. We're back to it. I mean, it's like
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:34.240]   the original sin of the internet, right? Which is, all this content is free. All these rides are
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:38.480]   dirt cheap, but at some point, there's going to come a reckoning for this.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:43.680]   We've seen this over and over again. This is how companies establish a foothold
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:47.920]   in the market. Investors don't demand that they be profitable right away. That's kind of the
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:54.080]   Silicon Valley way. And then, investors are really investing in this dream of the future,
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:58.880]   whether it's autonomous vehicles or one of the profit centers Uber could come up with also
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:03.760]   is deliveries. They've got people driving around all the time. They could deliver as they do food.
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:07.200]   They could deliver packages for Amazon. They could do all sorts of things. Although,
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:12.960]   we talked last week about Amazon Health this week. Amazon, according to the Wall Street Journal,
[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:18.000]   says they're going to launch a delivery service to compete with FedEx. I was just waiting for this
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:25.520]   to happen. And UPS, this is going to be a business to business initially, just as Amazon Health is
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:31.200]   going to be for employees only initially. But you have to think Bezos, one of the big costs
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:36.480]   for Amazon, especially with Amazon Prime, is delivery. They've been squeezing UPS and FedEx.
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.000]   But at some point, they're just going to deal them out.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:51.200]   Every time you eliminate a middleman, if FedEx and UPS need to make a profit in there,
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:58.400]   Amazon doesn't necessarily need to make a profit on shipping. If it becomes just a
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:07.120]   component of the purchase process instead of a cost center, they drive a lot of cost out of
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:12.160]   there. But unfortunately, they drive a lot of UPS and FedEx drivers out of business as well.
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.400]   The Journal says Amazon plans to undercut UPS and FedEx on pricing.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:23.280]   Amazon can lose money on this for five years while those companies bleed and eventually
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:26.480]   go out of business. And then, which is what Amazon has done all along with everybody.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:34.240]   The test project launches in the next few weeks in Los Angeles with third party merchants
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:39.520]   that sell goods on the Amazon website. But then they plan to expand the service to more cities
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:45.120]   and more people and eventually start delivering, picking up packages from businesses and shipping
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:49.680]   them to consumers. And I think it's just a matter of time before they say, "We don't really need
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:54.640]   UPS at FedEx. We've got our own fleet of planes now. They now have ocean freight."
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:10:00.560]   You know, pretty soon, Amazon's just going to own everything.
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:05.280]   Have you guys tried that thing where you can let them into your house at Amazon?
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:08.000]   I think it's called Key? Yeah, no, I wouldn't dare do that.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.400]   Yeah, it sounds creepy to me. I don't like that idea.
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:15.040]   Especially because it's the Amazon's logistics drivers. And that's that new thing Amazon's doing
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.440]   where they basically pick up somebody on the street and say, "Would you bring this package to Leo?"
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:22.640]   No, it's not that bad. But it's roughly the same model as Uber.
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:29.040]   So people, strange people with unmarked vehicles, you know, some guy, some guy pulls up in a
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.640]   2010 Chevy Impala and says, "Here's your package. It's a little scary, and that's the people who
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:40.000]   will have access to your house." You know, it kind of reminds me so recently, did you see this story
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.560]   about WAG, you know, that dog walking app? So this happened to a friend of mine, it made it to the
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:51.760]   news. She hired a dog walker and she wasn't home and they have a lockbox to let the dog walkers in
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:57.360]   and grab the dog. After the dog walker walked the dog, she came home and she found the guy's,
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:02.800]   the walkers, who's a guy, his wallet in her bed. Oh, that's not good. Under her sheets.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:08.880]   And it just made her wonder, like, "What the hell is this guy doing in my bedroom on my bed? And
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:12.960]   why is his wallet here, you know?" Under the sheets. Yeah, under the sheets, no less. You must
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:18.640]   take the nap. Yeah, super creepy. You know, so you got to think like, you let people into your home
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:23.600]   like that. Well, they had all these technological things like there's a camera and blah, blah,
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:27.920]   although somebody immediately showed that you could hack it so that you'd go in, you drop off the
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:32.640]   package, the camera would get that, you would disable the camera, you'd go back out, and then 30
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:37.040]   seconds later, the camera goes offline, you go back in, you rob the house and you leave. And
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.080]   there's no proof because the camera got you bringing the package and leaving. Right. Yeah, nice hack.
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:45.360]   And someone in the chat just... Could have been a tape over the lock. Yeah. Someone in the
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:49.440]   chat just asked me if the dog was in the bedroom. No, the dog was in the front in the crate. The
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.560]   dog in the living room. At least most dogs don't have wallets. So, yeah, I think that's probably a
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:58.960]   safe bet. Yeah, this is one of those things we were talking about. Like, you could see this
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:04.640]   problem coming from a mile away. Or are we that dumb or I don't know, it was Amazon that will fully
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.040]   blind over this tech like not saying where it could go wrong. You don't get to be the richest
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:14.320]   man in the world without breaking some eggs. Taking some risks. Yeah. Oh, yeah, taking risks.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:17.600]   I don't know what the eggs were supposed to be. Friends, we've come to the end of this show. We
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:21.600]   have many more stories we could talk about, but I know that you want to see us dancing Devindra
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.760]   and I don't want to keep you from your Olympics. So, we'll wrap this up. Devindra Harder-R
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:32.160]   Senior Editor at Engadget at Devindra on the Twitter. Thank you so much. Yes, yes. And
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:37.520]   movie podcasts at Slash Film. Don't forget Slash Film. Absolutely. Slash Film is... What are you
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:44.160]   talking about in the most recent episode? Coming up, there's this crazy Korean action movie.
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:49.440]   Forcing my cohosts to see it's called The Villainous. It's like half of a really good movie and half,
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:53.440]   not so good, but it's a lot of fun. And then, of course, we're going to be talking about Black
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:13:00.000]   Panther soon. Yeah. And Oscars. Oh, yeah. And Oscars. Yeah. I just saw last night, I saw the
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:05.520]   Winston Churchill, the darkest hour. That was, I was surprised. I've seen four Churchill movies
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:10.240]   this year. I don't know what it is, but this was the best one. This was good. Very good. Although,
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:15.120]   it's Gary Oldman. You can kind of tell it's Gary Oldman, but okay, he did a good job. And Gary
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:20.400]   Oldman doing the Gary Oldman, like shouting and really, really acting. Yeah, really acting. Yeah.
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:26.400]   Anyway, Slash Film. And it's a great blog too, if you want to, if you read the Slash Film blog,
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:31.200]   because there's a lot of news there and so forth. So, film cast, Slash Film Cast is the podcast.
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:34.560]   Yeah, we're right up there. Yep. The Cloverfield Paradox, what do you think?
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:39.920]   It is... It's not a good movie, but I had a lot of fun with it. It is really dumb.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:46.720]   It's so bad. It's so bad. And I'm so pissed off because the way they advertised it in a Super Bowl
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:52.240]   ad saying coming soon, and then they said another ad right after the Super Bowl, you had to watch it.
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:57.120]   Yeah. It's a baller move. Yeah. Baller. That's the right way to save the bad movie, basically.
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:01.680]   Yeah. Before the word gets out, watch it. Yeah. Because the live reviewers see it.
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:05.600]   Yeah. And I'll let the reviewers see it, whatever you do. That's Ed Bot from Santa Fe,
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:09.360]   New Mexico. It's always a pleasure to talk to you. Ed Bot report on ZDNet.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:14.320]   Anything else you want to plug? You got a book coming out? I know actually one of your books is
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:22.400]   free right now on Amazon. Well, I've got it. Really? Wow. Your Windows 10 book is somebody
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:27.600]   said in the chatroom is free on Amazon right now. Well... That doesn't mean you get no money.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:36.800]   Actually, don't get it. I have a series of eBooks that I did for Microsoft Press.
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:43.840]   So it's probably one of those. They've always been free, but they're now available through
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:48.080]   the Amazon store. But they're all really good books. So you can go ahead and get them. And then
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:55.760]   there's also Windows 10 Inside Out, which is in the second edition. Yes. This one's free. Windows 10
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:59.520]   for IT professional. That one's free. And that one I need to update as well.
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:06.080]   So I got... Yes. I'm just doing updates these days, just like Microsoft. All I do is updates
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:10.960]   anymore. Yeah. It's... I pull through all the wrong things. It's like they keep changing what's
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:16.000]   in Windows. It's... Yeah. So that one that one that you were just on there with the inside out.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:24.000]   It has a current book service, which means that with each new feature update to Windows 10,
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.480]   we do a new... We update the book and push it out there so that if you buy the print book or the
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:36.160]   e-book, you get these updates and you'll get three updates over a year and a half or two years.
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:39.760]   So you're always up to date on that. That's the only way to do it. You have to do that now.
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:44.400]   That's the only way to do it now. Yeah. Thank you. And always a pleasure. You're always so
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:48.480]   insightful. I really appreciate it. And Brian, XGen, thank you for coming all. Now, why do they
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:55.600]   make you use the X? It's a shirt for Xavier. Are you really a mutant? No. Do I need to out myself?
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:01.520]   It's fake. There's nothing that means nothing. It's the singing shoe from Brian, the other Brian.
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:08.720]   So the story goes that in college, I was writing for my college paper and there is another Brian
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:14.240]   Chen on campus. He was claiming that he was writing the articles. So I don't have an
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:18.480]   initial initial at all. So I had to make one up and the newsroom voted on X.
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:25.520]   And so I love that. It's been around forever. I love that. The newsroom voted on X.
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:29.760]   You know what though? It's memorable. You don't forget Brian XGen. Look for his
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:33.120]   byline in the New York Times where he covers consumer tech. And look out for the new crypto
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:40.320]   currency I'm starting called BXC. Here you go. Bingo. Boom. The X stands for nothing.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:44.960]   I'd love it to be here. Thanks for having me. Always a pleasure. Thanks for coming. I appreciate
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:49.040]   it. We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific. I hope you'll come and watch live.
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:56.800]   6 p.m. Eastern time. 2300 UTC. You can stream it live at twit.tv/live. If you do that, do what Brian
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:00.320]   did. Join us in the chat room. Did you enjoy the chat room? Yeah, it's fun. They're nice guys.
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.280]   I steal all the best lines. I've mined smart. X makes everything cooler, says Jello.
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:11.680]   I-R-C.Twit.tv. You can also be in our studio. We had great studio audience today. Thank you
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:16.480]   guys for coming. It really is nice to have a live audience because I pay attention to your
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:21.120]   reactions. And if you seem bored, like when you fell asleep, I just moved to the next subject.
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:28.640]   If you want to be in studio, just email tickets at twit.tv. Of course, you can get every show we
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:33.440]   do on demand. That's how most people watch. Nowadays, ask your Amazon Echo or your
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:39.280]   Google Assistant, Google Home, or even your Invoke. If you're one of the five people having a
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:46.720]   Harmon Carmen Invoke, like me and Ed, you can just, in most cases, ask, let me hear Twit.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.640]   Listen to the Twit podcast, something like that. Sometimes you have to say, "Listen to this week
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:55.360]   in tech." And you'll get the most recent episode. You can also listen to the live stream. Listen
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:59.760]   to Twit Live. Sometimes you have to say Twit Live on TuneIn depends on the device, but play around
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:03.360]   with it till you find out. And then that way, I think it's the best thing ever happened to podcasts.
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:08.880]   Makes it very easy. Works with HomePod too, if you have a HomePod. If you want to do it on
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:13.600]   your own schedule, understand that as well. That's easy. All you have to do is go to twit.tv and
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:18.560]   download an episode, or better yet, subscribe. We have audio and video. The subscriptions
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:25.200]   work with any podcast client, including Apple's podcast client overcast, PocketCasts, one of my
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:29.680]   favorites. If you subscribe, you'll always get the latest episode. The minute comes out.
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:34.400]   Thank you, everybody. Is tomorrow president's day? I think it's a holiday, right?
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:40.320]   Next week. Next week. I'm a shoot. Well, have a good work day. And we'll see you next week.
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:43.360]   On Twit. Another Twit is in the camera.
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:44.880]   - And we're fuzzy.
