[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:05.560]   It's time for Tuit this week at tech. The show that covers the latest technology news
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.800]   and one of the best panels we have ever assembled is here with us today to welcome me back from
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.080]   Norvay. They're not at this table apparently. No, apparently not. We tried anyway. No,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.200]   John C. Dvorak with his beach boy shirt. Is this now your Twit shirt? Do you like having
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.800]   it hanging on a hook? Because I get more negative comments from the chat room about
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.840]   this shirt. They hate that shirt. Harry Fuller hated this shirt when I was, this is a tech
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.040]   TV throwback call lecture. And every time I wore it, I'm going to find somewhere that
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.640]   makes and sells these. And I'm going to remind me, I'll need to buy John.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.680]   Different colors. It's like eight different colors. And we'll just have them here. But
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.280]   the thing is it's got to be real thick stripes. Yeah, no, no, we'll find that shirt. Yeah,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.360]   okay. John looks like he escaped from banana prison. See? I love this shirt. No, I love
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.920]   it. No, I love it. John C. Dvorak's here. Great to have you.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.880]   Welcome. No agenda show.com. This is a new thing. John Dvorak.com. You mean, channeled.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.080]   I say John channeled. I meant, what was it again? Channeled the four act. And we're
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.440]   going to ask him about his pills and just a moment. That's what the C means. John channeled
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.200]   the voice. John channeled. I like that. Yeah. Used to mean, that's Mike Elgin of Google
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.760]   Plus. I always say this because I don't know what else to say of. Well, now I could say
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.240]   of not only computer world, but you're writing for is it a bunch of bunch of stuff writing
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.800]   for IDG. I'm writing for a day to make sure you got a real job. I'm writing for a new
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.760]   site called house H.O.U. ZZ, which is like a really nice home design thing. And I'm like
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.720]   the tech guy now. Because you know, that is an issue when you design a home. You want
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   to be tech, you know, do a nice job of the tech homes, homes are becoming very, you know,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.040]   they're becoming computers. They're going to be built into the house that are smart,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.760]   smart homes. Yeah. So it's a great site. This is a nice time. I would love these some
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.920]   of these. This is like Pinterest, except they own all the stuff on there. It's not I was
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.000]   just going to say this feels like Pinterest. Yeah. What's the new layout for houses? I
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.040]   know it is the new thing, isn't it? It's the kind of the magazine style layout. Yeah,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.000]   lots of pictures. Yeah. That's the new tech guy says going to look like that. And also
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.240]   here from NSFW and scam school, formerly of game on Mr. Brian Rushwood, Discovery Networks.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.680]   Now a employee of Discovery. What is it? Is that didn't close though? Yeah, right? No,
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.560]   but I mean, it's announced, I guess. It's announced revision three acquired by Discovery.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.000]   I mean, I'm in the weird spot where it's like, you know, I'm not actually employed by revision
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.760]   three and don't, you know, didn't know anything going into this. So you basically got screwed
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.720]   into deal. You know what? I got exactly what I signed up for. Yeah, it's true. Nothing,
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.280]   which is true. Yeah, exactly. But it's interesting because scam school actually was the opening
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.000]   of the door to Discovery because you've been on the Discovery website. And that's all the
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.400]   thanks you get. That's right. Okay. I don't like where this is headed. Yeah. No, scam school
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.080]   was the first of the revision three properties to show up on Discovery.com in the life section.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.600]   You were the icebreaker. You in effect popped the Discovery cherry. I would like to think
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.160]   that. I don't know. I think it's true. No, it's a credit. Totally get nice shafted.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.800]   I believe they were independent of each other, but it was isn't very flattering. And I'll
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.000]   tell you what, like, you know, we pitched scam school as a Discovery show for the main
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.080]   Discovery channel. And in fact, I had me really John Ford, I believe his name. He was president
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.640]   of this is pre-driven three. No, no, no, this is this is like second year in once
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.000]   scam school was clearly a hit. We partnered up with Indigo Films. We did a series of pitches.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.200]   We did like eight pitches. And I full on like, we went to Discovery and they loved me. They
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.480]   loved the show, but they said, we think this would be a great companion to cash cab, but
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.960]   we're only putting money into prime time, not late afternoon. So thanks, but no thanks.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.120]   They say to kill the discoveries, a big company that is much more than the Discovery channels.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.440]   They have how many channels eight channels, nine channels, but they also have Discovery
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.240]   dot com. They're they're owned by somebody. Are they no, I don't think so. I keep talking.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.880]   I'll look at it. Find out who discoveries are. Book of knowledge. You know that they already
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.920]   acquired. In fact, as soon as I heard about it, I called my friend Jonathan Strickland
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.200]   over at How Stuff Works, who does the text off. They bought him because I was him specifically
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.320]   his experience in that in that thing. He said it was extremely positive. They they allow
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.580]   them total autonomy. They say, you know, they're able to in fact you could still go to How
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.280]   Stuff Works dot com. And it's not obviously in any way a Discovery site. Yeah. No,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.000]   absolutely. And and everything. So that's the hope is that that's what would vision three
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.640]   will experience as well that they'll be maintained as a kind of separate unit. I don't think that's
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.560]   and I should clarify that I know absolutely nothing. I'm an idiot who eats fire and sticks
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.280]   nails in his eyes for a living. But everything I've heard was that the experience seems to
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   have gone well for How Stuff Works. And I'm certain there'll be opportunities for cross
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.440]   promotion. And you know, I'm like, I'm how stuff works. If you listen to stuff, you should
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.280]   know what they've done though. The web technology that they're using is very high quality.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.760]   Yeah, so the security is incredible. Incredible. Yeah, you can try to go there and they say,
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.640]   no, because you we don't like. I don't know what that is. Discovery TLC is its own or
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.920]   discovery is its own operation. Yeah, I think so. Discovery communication. It owns the
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.840]   history channel and owns the learning channel. It loans animal planet owns all these channels.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.840]   And you learn nothing on any of these learning channels, by the way. Well, TLC like officially
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.320]   dropped learning from their natural TLC. TLC. What's the number one show on the history
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.760]   channel? Pawn stars. Yeah, of course. Well, and that's that's what that's the weird
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.160]   part is think about how many brands their number one show is completely outside of their
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   brand. Number one show for a long time, a national geographic was the dog whisper. It's
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.240]   like that a Bravo. It's desperate. New Jersey people think about Annie. It was something
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.080]   I believe that's the name of it. Well, you're the interesting housewives of New Jersey.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.480]   The desperate housewives of New Jersey. Yeah, that's right. Go on, Lee. That's ABC.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.520]   The ABC is desperate. They're desperate. Real housewives of New Jersey, not desperate
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.640]   because they're not. They're real. Fake ones on the other network. The fake ones on the
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.720]   other. So I read the interview with the Discovery executive who said, you know, we spend $700,
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.000]   $500, $750,000 an hour to make programming. So we're very excited to acquire a company
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.680]   that does it for a tenth the cost. And I thought, really, they spend $75,000 an hour for programming
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.640]   on revision three. Oh, not even that. Maybe maybe maybe for like a hundredth of that amount.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.440]   I mean, I don't know. That's what I think. Yeah, exactly. Like, look, look, I'll make programming
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.880]   for you for a talk. So who got rich? Who got rich? Who made they said $30 million for
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.360]   revision three, which is kind of a do you think that's mind boggling, John? You did you
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.880]   ever do a show on a vision three? No, no. I think it's I thought the number was lower.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.600]   But it was low. Well, no, somebody said it was 20 when I first said you said 20 to 40.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.480]   And the New York Times has said 30. So I think 30 is the number. Well, I think they only
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.520]   had about 30. I think they had about 30 put in. So I don't know if they had 10 put in total
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.520]   because I heard they had second some other rounds that came in. They did have two rounds.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.320]   And I think 10 was total. Well, I know the first round, my understanding was eight. Right.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.760]   So the second one have to be at least eight. You know, okay, you want to talk gossip, the
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.520]   gossip I heard was that they couldn't get a second round. So that the original funder,
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.880]   Graylock said, all right, all right, we're going to keep because you needed at this point
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.600]   they were desperate for cash. Right. Graylock said, all right, we'll give you a few more
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.960]   million, but that's going to be it. And at that point, I think revision three did a
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.760]   good thing. They pivoted a little bit. They became kind of an ad agency for for the most
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:22.000]   part in that. Not so much a creative content creator with scam school, but more an ad
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.520]   agency for YouTube stars like Philip Franco and Epic Mealtime. And I think that was an
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.440]   extremely important thing for them to do at that time. So you know, keep everything
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.920]   going alive. Yeah, I know for a while, scam school was like the last for a long while
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.520]   of stuff that was produced in house, but they do app judgment. They do scam school.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.920]   They do tech Zilla. Well, and I'll tell you, this is what's really exciting to me is I've
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.320]   been developing, you know, after we pitched scam school and it didn't go anywhere, I came
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.040]   up with four or five ideas of stuff that I could thought could be the next Brian Brushwood
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.960]   television property. And television is such a messed up business. I mean, you know, it's
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.920]   like it's you'll get 90% of the way there and somebody will have a bad Tuesday and justify
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.040]   their position, which is why I no longer have conversations with mainstream media because
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.120]   that's happened to me too many times. We get almost there. And then they go, yeah, never
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.800]   mind. Well, and you find these bizarre moments where you have an idea that you think is really
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   good and a fit for America. And they'll say, yeah, can you figure out a way to spend 10
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.720]   times as much on it? Because when you big television's got to be big, right? And so
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.480]   many of these ideas that I'm hoping I could do. How can you spend more money on this show?
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.560]   Yeah, no, absolutely. Because they want they want that bigger than life specter. They want
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.800]   to be glossy. So when I'm when I'm mostly excited, that's because you're a magician.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.360]   And that's what they do with magic. Sure. Sure. I mean, they don't do if it's
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.840]   desperate, Housewives of Virginia, they're not going to do how can we spend more money?
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.560]   Oh, no. Yeah, they do because there's like what celebrities can you even know what, you
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.800]   know, what crossovers can we do? But the main thing that changes for me is the number
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.560]   of opportunities. A lot of projects that I previously would have thought to pitch outside
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.320]   of revision three, suddenly with them having a rich uncle, it becomes way more important
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.480]   for me to pitch them in turn, right? Which again, that's good for a revision three.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.120]   They only got 30. That was only be a dub of well, the said maybe a triple or for all
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.480]   that those years. I don't know if that was what they wanted. I got more gossip. I'll
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.400]   give you more gossip. Okay. And just I'm just throwing this out. Picked it up in Norway.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.680]   And Norway was the talk of the fjords. Norwegians won't shut up. Boy, that's the truth.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   They're actually very tassy. And the region market. No, they're very tacit. Tasset. Most
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:26.320]   of the Nordic. They're like Germans with a sense of humor. Did gossip? Thank you, John.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:33.120]   John's always protecting me is that it wasn't a big payout for the founders, but it was a
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.640]   fairly successful payout for existing managers, which tells me that the reason discovery was
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.440]   interested in revision three is they liked the management team and they want to make
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.240]   sure that they were stay in place. This is always the issue when you acquire a company
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.560]   is that talent really bails. Yeah. So what they will do and I think they do in this case
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.120]   is make contracts with the people, the key people and those were fairly lucrative. But
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.800]   I was told, let's find out what what brush would what'd you get for your contract to
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.120]   be kept around employee of revision three. So I got I got to actually, if somebody guaranteed
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.200]   you'd stick around for working for work, did they any point say to you, even in the last
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.280]   few weeks, hey, you know, we want to make sure you kind of stick around or you're happy.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.360]   Did they do anything? I got to feel like I'm such a small piece of that pie that it wouldn't
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.200]   have answered is more no. That's actually surprising. I would have I would have actually
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.800]   just you seem to me a key employee. I would have done the same with Patrick Veronica.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.920]   Certainly Prager. Yeah, but you got to realize like, I mean, I may be one of the oldest hands
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.600]   of the revision three team, but I'm certainly not one of the most important when you compare
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.520]   to like, you know, Philip DeFranco coming in with, you know, he could find out a million
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.160]   views. You got to believe Philip DeFranco epic, the epic mealtime guys. Sure, sure. Those
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.240]   guys were absolutely. Yeah. Well, because those are established properties that would
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.680]   continue to do super well all on their own. Whereas like for me, it would be significantly
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.760]   difficult. I could stop scam school and next week come up with a completely different show
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.360]   called con class. Right. But but again, it's like, I don't want to do that. I love the
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.440]   scam school brand. I love what what we've been able to grow. But again, compared to like
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.280]   a pill to Franco, it's like, it's I don't see how I would even factor into revision three
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.440]   is thought process anybody's going to disappear. It's going to be a magician. I'd be worried.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.760]   I'd be really worried about that. After the ventriloquist, they don't have a ventriloquist.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.560]   So I know this isn't a really a big news story in general, but it's a story for us because
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.600]   these are mostly our friends. It's Kevin Rose, it's David Prager, it's Patrick Norton.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.400]   It's all the people I've worked with the tech TV was, you know, of the two companies that
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.960]   kind of came out of tech. You know, the funny thing was most of these guys came out of
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.520]   De Leel, the Port School of Broadcasting at some point or other. And so what did you get?
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.720]   You're going to get a finders fee or some sort of a thank you, a gold pen, maybe a watch,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.680]   I'll take it. Some sort of a gift. You know, the interesting thing is when we started
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:48.280]   Twitch, John, and you were there in episode five on, it was Kevin. Three on was Kevin.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.600]   It was you, Kevin Patrick. I had approached Kevin and Patrick said, let's do a partnership
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.840]   to make Twit. Kevin shortly thereafter went and founded revision three with money that
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.800]   he got from Jay Adelson. He gave him the opportunity to leave G4. He was a G4 still when we started
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.640]   doing Twit, and he started Ignatian, which was a kind of Twit-like show. So he was
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.560]   smart. He actually started revision three and he said, I hope he's done that.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.960]   Hold on, on the flip side, you've never had to take outside money, right? No. You've never
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.880]   had had any investors. That too, or we had gone to the opportunity to have had to.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.960]   But he's never done it. No, I haven't. But I mean, the point is, is by the way that
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.040]   makes me less attractive, I'm sure, John, you could probably speak to this to somebody
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   like Discovery that I haven't, that it's a sole proprietorship. Wouldn't that, doesn't
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.920]   that make me seem less serious? Less real? Well, if they came and saw your studio, they
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.320]   would think otherwise. But I think what happens is they figure, uh, it can't be real
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:46.120]   deal. No, I think there's a fear that it's like they always know the head guys walk,
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.440]   walk, right? Yeah. Well, you're so rooted in everything to the point that you can't.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.680]   Well, you're probably worth something. It's the Leo, that you, that you stayed on for
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.760]   five years and trained two other Leo's. One of the reasons that we bring in other people,
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.480]   we try to, we're doing TNT with Tom and Sire and I as we do lots of shows with other people
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.800]   because we're trying to be more than just me so that someday somebody will come along
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.960]   and offer me. I would not talk to Discovery. Sorry. I don't think that you're, uh, it's
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.040]   not what I think you not like to scurry. You like doing this. You like chatting and talking
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.840]   and talking and talking and everything. That was the irony. Jim Laderbeck for years said
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.640]   we're going to kill cable. We're going to kill cable until they came with a checkbook
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.120]   and he said, I love cable. There's nothing wrong with cable. Cable's a good thing. I
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:31.640]   killed in that meeting. Jim, Jim Laderbeck, huh? Did that amazing? Who would have thunk
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:38.120]   it? Yahoo CEO on the other hand is not a computer science major. He has no degree. How, why
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.280]   does anyone do this? Why would you lie on your resume and not not especially a CEO. You're
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.880]   already making a public corporation. You're already making it. You don't have to lie.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.200]   You're the CEO at Yahoo. You don't have to lie. All right. Now keep. All right. When
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.600]   you say resume, what is this resume that he submitted this piece of paper? Like from
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.640]   what I heard it was like a bio written up on him that he failed to dispute or something
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.640]   like that. But there's a history. There's a history of it. Yeah. They're you know, he
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.280]   claimed it even. I mean, he gave this. Tara Swisher had a great article on this. He had
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:11.120]   there was an interview with him in 2009 when he's still with PayPal. eBay PayPal. And he
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.720]   was a CEO at PayPal. Yeah. And the interviewer said, well, I can I know that you have a degree
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.960]   in both computer science and accounting. That's perfect for PayPal. And he said, well, yeah,
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.400]   you know, that's not what he said. Well, he said, he said, yes. Then what she said.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.480]   All right. Here it is. Moira John Moira got on tech nation. Your old buddy Moira.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.440]   My old buddy Moira. Yeah. Asked him about his college degrees, noting that they were
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.800]   in accounting and computer science. He said, quote, and then the question was he said,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.080]   what are the most important things you learned said Moira? Yeah, says Thompson failing to
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.400]   correct her. See, again, but look, you guys know you do interviews. What kind of douchebag
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.160]   would you be for somebody asking that question? And rather than answer the question, well,
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.560]   Moira actually, well, technically, I was a stone hill. I've done it a number of times.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.920]   I have a really a bunch of really old bios floating around. Somebody who introduced me
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.360]   at some, some conference or something right at the beginning with his long winded introduction.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:10.160]   They'll say I did something and I will correct the record before I give my speech. I he also
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.080]   said always do that because you also correct the grammar of other people.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.560]   Introducing the point. He also said in response, and that's really the background that I have.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.400]   And it started back in my college days. And I think that's really the wonderful part of
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:28.320]   being an engineer is that you think this way. Yeah, this is this. Here's here's here's why it
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.400]   matters. I would wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on a second, Mike. What bullshit are you
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.040]   trying to cover up here with this argument? What is your hope to answer? Do you have a test?
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.800]   It's cool. It's cool in a credit accredited university. Why are these scams cool? I mean,
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.000]   maybe this is you know, I come from showbiz where everything is, everything is bullshit.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Yeah, exactly. Totally. And so, and so at some point it's like you're not going to ruin someone
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.720]   else's show to correct every little thing. And plus it's like, look, for example, let's
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.840]   there was no computer science degree program available at his university. But he has a narrative
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.960]   that is authentic that he's, you know, he took computer science classes there. Right. And so,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.280]   and so if if the story other people are reporting, because here's the problem, you cannot get in the
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.120]   business of going around correcting the media on all the things they get wrong about you. The media
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.680]   sucks balls at getting things right. It was the year who went up. There's not been a single article,
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.400]   even interviews with me where they were they even quoted me correctly and if I made a job
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.360]   going around saying, oh, no, it wasn't a nail in my ear. It was a nail in my eye. Yeah. But if it was
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.960]   a nail in your eye or ear or whatever, it was not supposed to be on your own website with arrows
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.200]   pointing to it. I think you were the year. Now, was it his website or was like he physically made it
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.160]   by himself or somebody else made it and he didn't get around like the Yahoo corporate. Wasn't it?
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.480]   Yeah, somebody's buy it on the corporate side. The point is all of this. The only one thing
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.720]   matters. Can he do the job or can't? No, that's not what matters. Here's why. Here's why.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:56.160]   Wrong. The reason he should be fired is if a low-level person at Yahoo did this, he would be fired.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.560]   True. And so we can either say, well, we have a double standard for a millionaire, CEOs, they get
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.800]   to go to work with stuff the residents don't. But if any of us had real work instead of being
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.280]   journalists and media people, if we had real jobs and we worked at companies and we, our resume,
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.800]   said we had a degree we didn't have, we would be fired. So if Yahoo wants to have a policy where,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.120]   if we catch you fudging your resume, you won't be fired, then I think that he also should be
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.440]   part of that policy. But I don't like this double standard.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.080]   I would hate to break it to you, but there exists a double standard between millionaires,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:32.480]   CEOs, but we shouldn't agree with it. But again, this guy did not write up a piece of paper with lies
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.360]   he wrote about himself. This is something that happened around and to. Okay, well, no, you're
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.960]   right. That's a good point. If he did, then certainly, if he intentionally lied, then that
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.280]   is definitely a problem. But this, this massive focus on, on a bio that was written about him
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.040]   that he failed to correct in this quote out of context from an interview from not a minor
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.760]   aspect of the bio. It's not like he, you know, had was born on April 6th and it says April 5th.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.920]   All right. Well, how about this? Like I've got a degree in computer science and I'm in a computer
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.120]   company. But is that does that matter to if the CEO has a degree in computer science?
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.800]   No, not at all. In fact, most CEOs don't have degrees in computer science is there usually
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.520]   a man or something else. It doesn't speak to his ability to the job. It speaks merely to his honesty.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.920]   And then the question becomes, well, how much did he know or was this somebody else writing the
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.920]   bio and didn't notice it? Or did he say, hey, I know they didn't have it. You know,
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.000]   somebody might write of me say that he graduated from Yale. That's not true. I dropped out.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.440]   But I might not make a big deal about it as you point out if somebody says actually I would. But
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.360]   Boy, you would have been hired and that was in a bio notice. But I might not notice if it was
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.360]   in a bio that I didn't write. Yeah, what this is going on for why I, here's what I have. Here's
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.280]   the real problem I have with this sort of thing because I've known a bunch of people that I would
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:48.000]   just call pathological liars. And they start when they make up anything, I always have to assume
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.120]   maybe a lot of it is bull crap. And you know, maybe a lot of their skills are bull crap.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.960]   When you start seeing bull crap, you have to maybe once in a while, it's a one shot bull
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.120]   crap. The guy was accidentally full of it. But generally speaking, when a guy is full of it
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.640]   and any level, he is full of it on a lot of levels. And I get real skeptical when I run into one of
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.320]   these guys because they try to trick you into believing stuff that's not true.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:19.120]   It speaks to his integrity. Yes. Yeah. I don't know. It's I don't know enough about this specific
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.800]   situation. And certainly if someone's a pathological liar, I'm not going to defend that practice.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.200]   But I do know like I look at my own life, like I'll tell somebody that I went to University of
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.400]   Texas at Austin where I studied the Plan 2 honors program in history. And the fact is I had enough
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.160]   history credits that if I was one planet to plan, it's a special honors programs at UT where it's
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:43.840]   like they only take 150 students each year. And you go to a planet plan to plan to it's its own
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.800]   it's its own liberal arts major, right? And so you didn't finish after? No, I did. But but after I
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.520]   graduated, I discovered that if I had taken just one more history class, I would have had a double
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.560]   major. But I didn't was your major was your major in plan to plan to is the name of the major
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:06.240]   of a living. Anyway, anyway, the point is part of agenda 21. If somebody misreported or misinterpreted
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.320]   my statement to mean that I said that I had two degrees, correct them? Well, it depends on the
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.520]   situation. You wouldn't really know. In the middle of a in the middle of an interview, I probably would.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:19.120]   But if it was in your official bio? So yeah, I mean, I would I would it's amazing to me how times
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.720]   an amorphous statement like I studied blank and blank could be interpreted immediately. So this
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:31.360]   is all really about you. Oh, you're concerned about not having any real degree, but bogus plan
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:38.960]   to think for some some correspondence. I don't know. By the way, what is agenda 21?
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:45.280]   Gena 21 is this you should go to the UN site and download don't download never mind
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:53.520]   to just like 700 pages of of a entire scheme to take over the governments of all the world
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.160]   to to create a better planet. It's basically a one world government scheme that has very specific
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.320]   things that everybody has to do who signs on to this. Getting a degree and the university.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.600]   I'm the university. I'm sorry. The United States of America's environment. Oh, yeah, sure. It's about
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.120]   the reading it is to protect the earth. Yeah, that's what they that's the cover to resolve
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.200]   widening inequalities and income. There you go. There's another one to solve that. So in other
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.800]   words, we're supposed to give our money to poor African countries. It's all really aimed at
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.160]   soak in the US. It says it's about sustainable development. Yeah.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:33.200]   It's a good one. All right, we're going to move by the way, Scott Thompson's response to this is the
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.160]   tech world is out for blood. You should just focus on your job and pay less attention. We don't even
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.320]   know the guy. One thing we can agree on. That's what I'd like to ask you guys. Why are you off
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.960]   for blood? We're not even know this guy. We're not out for one thing you can agree on.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.680]   Just one more reason that Yahoo is just going straight down the table. Anything wrong?
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.360]   It's so you got to feel for them. This is this is the comedy of errors.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.400]   The guy. I don't know. He doesn't even look. He looks kind of shifty.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:06.240]   See this is I think he does too. What can I agree with Leo?
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:14.000]   I think I think I saw him in a post office once. All right. We're buying stamps.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.680]   Actually, if he was using stamps.com, he would never have a bag.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.640]   Yeah, have it. Unfortunately, they're not an average. They will be going forward. But
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   so just remember stamps.com. Actually, I want to talk about it. Squarespace.com quickly. And
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.800]   then we're going to get to the galaxy. S three space. I want to know, did I make a horrible,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:39.760]   horrible mistake by not covering the live announcement of yet another Android phone?
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:46.800]   Some people think I did. We'll talk about it. But first, squarespace.com, everything you need to build
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:53.040]   an amazing website. It's hosting. I got to say this. I think people don't understand when I talk
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.800]   about it. They think, Oh, this is blogging software. Oh, no, so much more. It is web hosting.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.640]   The best web hosting you can get plus on top of it. Really great software for any kind of website,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:11.280]   whether it's a photo gallery, e-commerce, a blog. Yeah, it'll do a blog. You've got to check it out.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.720]   Now, the nice thing about squarespace is they are so confident that you will love them that they
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.960]   actually just say, come on, try it. You don't need to give us a credit card or anything. Yeah,
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   it's almost like it's like a street fight. Try it. It's like, come on. First one's free.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:31.920]   Suck. Come on. Bring it. Try it. Or it's like when they when in the karate movies, they go.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.240]   With your hand, you know, they go, come on. Everything you need to create a
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:45.200]   placing website, click the try it free button. No credit card needed. All you need is a mouse
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:52.320]   to click the button, I guess. You can do with your finger if you're on the iPad. You get everything.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.640]   You get the domains. You get the hosting. You get analytics. You get 24/7 support. They even,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.800]   they're so committed to having your site look great and work great that they have. Let me go to
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.880]   workshops. I think it's workshops.squarespace.com. Oh, this is the stuff where they teach you.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:14.400]   All the free webinars. Yeah. So it's a really great way to get started. They're free for everybody
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:19.280]   and all levels of experience. So if you're like a CSS wizard, you can take a workshop there. They
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   have, by the way, a CSS pop out editor that's incredible with color coding and code. That's what
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:29.520]   they did for my website. When we brought them on sponsors for scam school, they redid my schwood.com
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:36.560]   website, SHW OOD, total CSS. This is stuff that is way over my head. But even though I'm an idiot
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.280]   and don't know anything, this is the new site. Yeah. It's been up for a couple of years now.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.800]   But it's like, look at that. It's everything super simple. It's nice. And if you scroll down,
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.160]   it's got Twitter widgets in there. So I'm able to update it from the road.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.840]   Yeah. There you go. Do you use the iPhone or the iPad app? I use the iPhone app not only for
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.120]   updates, but to get rid of spam because I never think to log in and clear out the spam out of
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.520]   the comments. But I do think because it's so easy just on the phone while you're sitting at the
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.400]   airport or whatever, clear out all the fake comments on there. They have something new that is really
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.560]   cool. Then it's just during the month of May, but they're going to. So a lot of times people,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.640]   you have like schwood.com. And now it's kind of complicated to make schwood.com be square space.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.080]   So what I notice when I go and you got to take advantage of this because when you go to schwood.com,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.680]   you get schwood.squarespace.com. That's, you know, there's a better way.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.880]   See, I'm old school. Cause that like original, I'm like, well, it'll promote square space,
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.720]   whatever. They were nice enough. That was nice. Yeah. But tell me about the other thing. What can
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.800]   I do? So now that you could, this month only when you use this, I'll tell you how to do it,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.640]   use a special code, square space is offering free domain registration when you sign up for an
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.840]   annual plan that's integrated with the sign up process. So as you sign up, you say, I want schwood.com.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.880]   They'll do all the wires in the background. You get the, you get hassle free setup. You get a free
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.520]   domain. It's about 15 bucks worth of it. And they, and, and it's all done for you. So it's really great.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.240]   If you say, you know, I want to have fancy pants.com or whatever, it's all done for this is,
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.400]   they have made it very, very easy to create a new website. If, even if it's your first,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.640]   and if it's not your first, you're going to see why so many people love square space and the pricing
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.880]   now simplified and a lot lower $8 a month for the standard plan. If you want unlimited,
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.560]   I don't know anybody who does this unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:26.880]   Wait, no, you can't have unlimited storage for $60. $16 a month. Is that for real? Yeah.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.920]   All right. That's if you buy the annual feels like you get four audiences, which is nice.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   So you can have storage. Yeah. So I could use this instead of one of those,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   actually, that's an interesting idea. Yeah. Just to store all your files.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.760]   Google Drive. It'd be great for a podcast unlimited bandwidth. You know, you don't have to worry
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.440]   about it. And they never go down because they have a very sophisticated. And we tested it recently.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.080]   You can't break it. Seems so. Were you able to break it?
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:55.680]   No. With your vast no agenda audience? All 50 of them. They were pounded. They were
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:01.280]   pounded in the site and it was just sticking. Anyway, try it free for 14 days. And if you decide
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.000]   you want to sign up, 10% off your first purchase. That's why you want to do the one-year purchase
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.440]   and the free registration. But the offer code is, "Twit 5" for the month of May, "Twit" and the number
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.880]   five, when you sign up. I'm just thinking you're going to love this. The secret behind some of the
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:26.320]   best websites in the world, Squarespace.com. Galaxy S3, are we excited?
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.240]   Sure I am, Leo. No, you're not. They're getting bigger and bigger. It's 4.8 inches,
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.600]   which is getting to the size of the clone. But you carry when you have it. Where's it?
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.360]   It's in the other room. Are you throwing your entire notes? Here's the problem with it.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.000]   Here's what I'm making. This note thing is getting on my nerves.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.680]   Would you get my, is John here or somebody? Would you get my note?
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.200]   I just wrote a column and market, market watch about this. I got it on the tether.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.240]   There's obviously a, some sort of a weird trend going on. It's bigger and bigger.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:02.560]   Yeah. You know what's funny? For a while, the idea was you'd have a bigger watch,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.720]   but a smaller cell phone. Yeah. Right. Remember that real little bitty? That's going to be a
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.160]   star tactic, the one that they brought, the dinky one with this big. Yeah. Remember David Borman,
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.920]   who's a big fat guy? He had this little, he was talking like this. It's extremely small.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.600]   It's so stupid. By the way, David's last weight, he looks good and the phone still looks stupid.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.720]   What it's all about, I think, the big screens. It's yet, it's one of the many ways in which
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.960]   companies, Android handset makers, are trying to not be Apple iPhones. They're trying to get out of
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:36.480]   the way of the iPhone. So A, they don't have patent headaches in the courts. And they're
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.720]   also trying to just differentiate because, I mean, there's, there's a certain number of people like
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.960]   Leo who want the gigantic screen. The majority probably want an iPhone size screen or, you know,
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.720]   a smaller screen. But, you know, they're trying to be not iPhones. There was a article on Android
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.080]   Police calling the Galaxy S3, the first smartphone designed entirely by lawyers. That's actually a
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.920]   good article. Yeah, it is actually. It breaks it down showing how all the design choices are.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:05.360]   And by the way, I'd like to know why type fonts cannot, typefaces cannot be copyrighted.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.640]   Or patented. Or they can't. No, they can't. Only the names. They can actually copyrighted.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:18.320]   Or patented fashion. If, if Gwen Kordi, when you go to seek one of the big fashion designer shows
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:24.640]   in Milan or wherever, those designs cannot be patented or copyrighted. So why is Apple getting
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.400]   away with getting this patented when it's obviously a design and designs cannot be patented or copyrighted?
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.280]   It's trade dress. And I'll tell you why. Because of confusion in the marketplace,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:41.120]   people, Apple's contention is that Samsung intentionally made it look like an iPhone so that when you
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.120]   got to the phone store, that's what the fashion people do with their knockoffs. They make it
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.760]   intentional. They look like the exact same thing. And that's what when you run into a typeface like
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:55.600]   hell, instead of Helvetica. And hell, by the way, was used by HP and in their original
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.880]   laser printer, they had their little cartridge. Remember that? And hell was in there. It was a
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.560]   complete ripoff of Helvetica, but it was called hell or Geneva.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:12.560]   The note, it's hard to tell because it's in the new Papillon case. But I think, no, I brought my
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:18.960]   dog instead of I couldn't find my phone. That big clunkery could find. I lost it. In fact,
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.760]   there's I'm surprised the phone doesn't bark at you like the dog. So tell me which side of this
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.640]   are you on, John, that you feel like we need legal protection for fashion or that we need?
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.360]   No, I think we need no legal protection. Exactly. That's where I'm at.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.960]   Including the phone design. Now, if you call the phone in Aussie rings, he ate it.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:42.880]   Okay, he's got a million of them. So here's the so here's so I'm doing the Noah Janice show with
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.200]   curry. Yeah, he says, I, you know, I'm gonna get it. I love this Andrew, but I'm getting a new phone.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Get the note. And he says, I'm getting a note. He's gonna love it. I said, what are you getting a
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.320]   note Leo has? No, and then he says, well, that's interesting because I think this is the way to go.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:02.560]   It is. It's, you know, it's selling like hotcakes. And so then two nights ago at dinner, my son's here,
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:09.200]   he says, you know, I'm getting rid of my he's getting a note. Yes. I said, you got to be crazy.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   No, it's a great one. And Adam wants one. What does this note think? What's actually a huge success?
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.160]   It's a huge success. And I'm surprised because I, you know what, I thought this is nuts. Nobody's
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.400]   gonna want this. I like it, but nobody's gonna really want this because it's just five point
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.120]   three inches. What's this big? Didn't they, didn't they call that a tablet when it was a
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.120]   Dell streak was like the same size? It's a little smaller than the streak, but it's, you're right.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.280]   It's almost a tablet. And that's what no, it's Samsung's pitch on this is it's a compromise between
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   a tablet and a phone, but it's small enough because they make them so thin and small enough to still
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.080]   slides in your pocket. But that's what's interesting is now this, there it is. That makes it look
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:53.360]   bigger than it is. It is big. It's not that big. They got a person with small hands.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.120]   Serious size of that. It's not that big. Now it's interesting because that has the S Pen and doesn't
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:08.000]   the new Galaxy S3 have a pen. It's called the P Pen? No, the C Pen. C Pen. I don't know why it's
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.840]   good. Well, I think he's stumbled onto our actual trend. So I wrote a column in his last Friday's
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.280]   market watch describing the trend. Yeah. And with this, my same shocked, shocked and dismayed,
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:23.600]   but I'm now subscribing to what you stumbled onto, which is a bigger is better that that size. And I
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.400]   think is maybe a magical size. Sweet spot. Yeah. It's a sweet spot size. And I think they're, you
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.840]   know, they're, they're, I, my idea in the column was that Samsung above all the other companies
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:40.240]   doing more experimentation with size and shape. And so they went from 4.3 to 4.8 to get a 5.3.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.000]   They're testing, testing, testing. And then they're going to find and say, look,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.400]   and Apple's going to be behind the eight. They didn't go anywhere. They simultaneously have
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.480]   all shapes. Have you ever looked at all of Samsung's phones? They even have amazing.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.280]   The Samsung player. They're really experimental. Which is a Galaxy S2 kind of device that has no
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:03.600]   phone. It's an iPod touch. Yeah. So I think that they, we gain from that, don't we? Because,
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.840]   yeah, we get to see what people really like instead of trust. You're going to like this. I'm
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:13.520]   Apple. You must, did you use one phone? Did you talk about this article in the Android police?
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   Yes. I brought it up. That's how we got into that conversation. Yeah. Talking about how the
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.320]   design clearly screams like, look, very much not Apple. It's ugly. Please don't sue us.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:27.920]   It's not ugly. Everything's ugly. I agree. I don't think it's ugly. It's just, it's not beautiful.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:34.720]   It looks very generic. It's inspiring. I mean, it's fun, lighter for having seen it.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:40.560]   This is, this is, this is the funny thing is that Apple said, well, you can make a phone or a tablet,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:47.520]   as long as it's not anything like our stuff, which means it doesn't have rounded corners.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.680]   So, okay, we're going to make it square corners. It can't be the aspect ratio of a phone. So you
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.840]   have to make it kind of like wide or short. I want to see an uneven phone. You can't have like a
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:05.440]   Samsung trapezoid, whereas it's wide of the top. What was it? The dandier-mifflin triangle.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.960]   I tried a killer. There you go. You got it in your mifflin. You can't have a display of colorful
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:16.640]   square icons in a grid with rounded corners. Have you already talked about, and I could totally see
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.760]   the phone getting so big that you increasingly rarely pull it out of your pocket and instead start
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.360]   to rely on-- That's kind of the way it is, right? Ancillary devices, like the Pebble. I think the
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   Pebble is going to be phenomenal when you get me into it. I ordered one of those. That's the watch.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.200]   The watch is the most successful Kickstarter in history. It was 8 million plus.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.960]   And I think Apple's going to come out with a watch. You think so? Yeah, within the next year or two.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.600]   Absolutely. Really? I'm going to use a mod Pebble. But then--
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.920]   Did you order it? Did you get on the--? Yeah, well, I haven't yet, mainly because it's like,
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.160]   it's clear it's going to get made. So I'm just going to wait. 8.7 million dollars. They wanted to
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:54.480]   make-- They wanted to raise $100,000. And they haven't even come to the end. They raised over,
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.600]   I think, 5 million in a week. So let me ask you this. This has been a phenomenal--
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.840]   There's a phenomenal euphoria for Kickstarter projects right now. And I think on balance is good.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.720]   We've seen some amazing success stories, Double Fine Productions raising $2 million when they
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.800]   just wanted $1.25 million, right? The guy who created Wasteland wants to make Wasteland 2,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.080]   and that's been super funded. But the question is, what we haven't seen is any of the backlash
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.240]   when after these products come out and they're not what we hoped they would be.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.640]   That's going to happen, but it hasn't happened yet. Exactly. But the weird thing is there's going
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.760]   to be a strong lag time. You still have like six months to promise the moon to everyone,
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.080]   collect a bunch of Kickstarter money. And I wonder how they're going to enforce accountability on
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:41.440]   this kind of thing. Or if you'll have a reputation, or if there's some kind of commenting dig style up
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:46.640]   and down vote. Isn't this what the Jobs Bill also accomplished? The Jobs Bill changed the threshold
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.520]   for buying into stuff. Right now, you're not investing in this company. You're just saying,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.040]   I'm going to give you so much buy the product. But it feels like you're investing. It's kind of
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:00.560]   like a cheap way to be so ready. Because the Jobs Bill, which is now the law, I don't know when
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.360]   it goes into effect, allows you to go to people and say, "Hey Mike, you want to invest in my company?"
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.520]   In the past, you had to have a certain-- there was a means test. You had to have a certain amount of money.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.320]   Yeah. Not anymore. You could do this. They've completely eliminated those restrictions.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:20.240]   And I have a feeling that the next Kickstarter is not going to be, "Hey, get a t-shirt or get the watch."
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.200]   I'm showing you that. It's going to be like micro loans, but on the other way.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.880]   I kind of like to do that with Twi-- Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.160]   Yeah. No. Breaking news, Leo Lapour, now offering shares in Twi.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:38.560]   It's legal. You could sell bricks. No, but see the bricks, all you got was a brick. You didn't get any
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.280]  -- you didn't get any investment. Yeah, you want to do this. Do you think I should? Oh, yeah.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.720]   Yeah, I'd hate to suggest it, but there's going to be a lot of graft.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.280]   Well, that's the thing. He wants to get in on it. He wants to get in on it.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.400]   Essentially, this eliminates what was it.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.640]   Intended as protection for consumers. But you know what I love about Kickstarter as an idea.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.480]   Look at this picture. So what do you think of these watches?
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.720]   The Starks are great. The Flip Stark. They're exactly the same. I know.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.000]   That's what these things are exactly the same. I know. So look at these guys. You know who that is?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.240]   Who? The CEO and founder of Groupon. They're laughing about how much money they've made.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.520]   And you know what? Their stock is now in the single digit. It's plummeted.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.520]   Yeah, they're there. There's 50 cents in. Yeah. Well, it might be. You'll be sorry.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.840]   Give it time. And this is one of those tough free market questions that we always end up
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:29.200]   bringing up when I seem to be here. But it's one of those things where just as the efficiency of
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:35.360]   digital distribution has made available what was it? Michael Robertson, mp3.com, is that the guy?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.520]   He called the middle class rock star. Now we now have the middle class
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:45.040]   benefactor, the middle class investor, the middle class venture. So when did they ever benefit?
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.080]   Well, that's the whole thing with the middle class and all these
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:54.480]   citizen investors, they get real in like suckers and then they're whole to shore and then they're
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.200]   broke. I mean, the whole scam is to bring the public into these deals, which is what
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   Dobama's inviting here with this deal. But you have been anti-Sarbanes Oxley all along.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.120]   One of the effects of this is to overturn some of the features of Sarbanes.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.840]   Absolutely. That the whole thing is a disaster. You should be happy about that.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.520]   Now, though, on the other hand- Many of these compliance requirements started with Socks.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.720]   Now, on the other hand- On the other hand, I would just get a little bit on the other
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:25.360]   side of the argument, which is once in a while, you might get lucky as an idiot investor
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.320]   and pick some winner and then rock it out. I mean, you could have bought Microsoft at 16 bucks.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.840]   And when it first came out and it doubled and doubled and split and doubled and split,
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.680]   you would have made for every save you put a thousand in, you would have come out of there,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.720]   nearly a millionaire.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:48.240]   Like when I'm saying middle class benefactor, these are largely artistic ventures on Kickstarter
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.720]   to where like you are going to give $50 to somebody who wants to create his first comic book ever.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.040]   Like our friend Brett Rounselville, his life dream was to write the provider a comic book.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.280]   And it's like everybody felt great about making his artistic dream come true.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.400]   Nobody cared about whether or not it was an investment, you're going to make money back or
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.280]   anything like that. But when this kind of thing comes to pass and you do have people
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.520]   playing the market of Kickstarter for very different reasons, I think you are going to run into
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.960]   some very ugly consequences. Well, that's what the AARP was against.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.560]   The AARP was against the jobs bill because they were worried that older people would be duped by
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.240]   solicitors who would call and say, I have an investor. People are easily duped apparently.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.720]   Steve Case, the guy who was promoting this, the founder of AOL said, well, look, we don't
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:35.280]   protect gamblers against casinos either. What about people buy lottery tickets? Incredibly poor
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.840]   people spend fortune mostly on lottery tickets. And it's a total scam. And not only is the government
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.440]   not protecting them, they're the ones running. They're doing it. They're providing the lottery.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.920]   So why not let people invest in companies rather than. So the government's ripping everybody off
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.600]   and then everybody's ripped. Might as well let everyone rip everyone off of the hell with it.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:57.360]   I want to say, when we come back, I do want to talk about something that seems to be going on
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.840]   with the group on, which really clearly now as the stock price continues to tumble was a bubble
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:10.400]   event. Yes. Oh, yeah. Facebook IPO is coming up. We're talking about OMG pop. Zinga bought a bubble
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:18.480]   or $200 million on the day it was them at this close to the peak as you can get. It's lost 5 million,
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:25.440]   5 million users in the last 30 days. Zinga completely screwed by this. So let's our topic next irrational
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:30.560]   exuberance. Are we in another bubble? We will continue. John C. DeBorack is here from channel.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   dorack.com. He likes the short stocks here. He's a grumpy stock shorter.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:44.160]   Scamschool. Brian. Schwood.com is here for me to set up my own grift. Mr. Libertarian. He says,
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.680]   no regulation. I want to be able to rip off anybody I so choose. That's what the whole point of
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:54.240]   scam school is, frankly. Yeah. This guy's got a show about it. You know, if I was a beer guy to
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:00.000]   con how to win bar bets. Yeah. Yeah. Which is basically taking drunks for whatever's in their
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.280]   pocket. Yeah, but then you like give them a hug afterwards. It's different. And of course, Mike
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.760]   Elgin. So did the courts who has nothing to sell. Nothing to sell. No hugs for anyone.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.520]   You know what I'm excited about? And I wish I had one. And I'm kind of sad that I don't.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.960]   I thought I was going to be on this list. The Ford Focus Electric is here.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.000]   I was trying to get on the list again. I was trying to. Scott Monty said, well,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.720]   we have a friends and family list. No, you're going to buy one. Well, I was going to borrow one.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:33.360]   I was. Oh, I didn't. I just want to test one. I tested all these electric cars and I
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.800]   can't seem to get this one. Okay, get ready. Okay. So they've got two. They've got the 2012
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.920]   Ford Focus Electric and then soon the Ford Fusion Energy, which is a plug-in hybrid.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   I actually kind of like the plug-in hybrid idea. Yes, because you can get that white sticker
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.600]   and go across the bridges free. You can get that with an electric, can't you?
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.120]   Yes. That's what I said. No, but I like the plug-in hybrid because you've got a gas engine.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.280]   Yes, I know. But you still get the sticker. It has a.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.880]   It's got a sticker. You got to plug it in. You power it. But then if you need to go farther
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.640]   than the limit of the battery, it's a it's a it seems to be more practical. Anyway,
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.720]   both are available for for bopping around 10. I mean, the Ford Focus Electric. I don't know what
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.840]   the range is actually. I wonder if they say that. Yeah, it's probably the same as all of them.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:19.440]   You want the motor 100% electric range of get ready. Oh, wow. They're ready. 76 miles.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:25.280]   All electric all electric. That's better than any electric. I would like to see a mileage. I
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.720]   want to see one with my with the range of 500 miles. Yeah. So what I mean, you know how many
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.400]   batteries you'd have to have a pickup truck. No, I need to carry the new technology. Yeah, we need
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.800]   new battery technology. Yeah, well, that's not. 76 miles. It also has the best in class,
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:43.760]   240 volt charge time. You got to get that 240 volt charger in the garage and that's easy.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.960]   And then it's fastest to charge the most fuel efficient five passenger vehicle in America.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.800]   They are using the state of the art and the batteries. I mean, that's how they're getting 76
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.360]   miles per gallon. I mean, right driving range. They claim and I don't know why they say this 110
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:03.600]   miles per gallon. But it's called. It's this new thing. MPGE. I have done this calculation
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.960]   because I test drove a couple of these cars. How do you do that? I mean, isn't it? You base it.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:14.000]   No, you base it on the amount of money you spend per mile and then you extrapolate the amount of
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.920]   gasoline that will how much gasoline could you buy for that? That's what the E means in MPGE.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.120]   It's equivalent. That's new that they put that on there. But it's a calculation based on it.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.280]   That makes sense. So 110 miles per gallon equivalent. That's actually pretty cool.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.840]   That's what they pretty much all are. No, most of them. I've seen 100 110. Okay.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.960]   76 miles. That's a better range. Most of these guys are 40 miles, 50 by 76 miles.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.600]   I can get to San Francisco and back. That's all I care about. Well, it depends how many bars you
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:47.040]   stop at. It is available purchase now at a EV certified dealer's the 2013 Ford Fusion Energy
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:53.520]   Plug-in Hybrid is coming in 2013. It will have 100 MP over 100 MPGE. Here's another thing people
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.160]   should think about. So I go into the Oakland airport to take a flight out and I'm walking out of the
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.800]   line. I know what you're going to say. The plug's right there. There's a bunch of plugs for electric cars.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:08.000]   The best part of best spots. Front row parking. Yeah. And by the way, so it's always vacant.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.400]   Well, no, there was one car parked in some douche bag that was an electric parked in one of the other.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.080]   Not allowed. No, no, you're going to have a plug.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.440]   That is the best thing. And there's never anybody in that electric car slot.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.520]   Yet. Yet. So there will be a good time to have an electric car.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:28.640]   I love how they've done the driver information systems, both on board and off. You can manage
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:34.800]   the recharging process on your phone. Yeah. Determine the most eco-friendly driving route.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.040]   That's new. So you've always had fastest, shortest. Go friendly. Now the least energy use.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:44.160]   Remotely control vehicle charge and preconditioning settings. Minor control vehicles.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:50.400]   Monitor battery, state of charge, maximize energy efficient. Of course, sync and the My Ford Touch will be
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:58.720]   especially adapted for electrified driving with fuel level, battery power level, average and
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.520]   instantaneous miles per gallon. Regenerative braking. Of course, we know about that. That
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:09.360]   captures about 90% of the energy lost in braking. There she is. That's her. Who is that? I don't know.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:15.680]   The system's. I'm going to do that sometimes. Like, hey, there he is. That guy. That's the woman.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:23.600]   Let's see. What else? Oh, you can actually monitor the regeneration and maximize your range with the
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:29.200]   My Ford Touch EV features. This is all cool. This is the website, Ford.com/technology.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:36.160]   And there's also this value charging feature that's in the Ford Sync. It's actually Mark Microsoft
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:41.120]   came up with this, where it lets you set, depending on your utility, off peak hours for charging. So
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.480]   it doesn't charge. Yeah. Plug it in. Until three o'clock in the morning. But then it charges when it's
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.800]   cheapest. Yeah. It's cool. I just think this is so, I'm so excited. You're going to get one.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.400]   Yeah. As soon as they left me. When you do your Mustang, would you like it?
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:59.200]   I'd love to have that Mustang is a nice car. I know. It's got a gasoline V8. It's like going,
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.600]   it's going from the worst to the best. Yeah. It has a feature that says, what's the least
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:09.760]   ecological route to this? We're going to gun it. Just step on it. Exactly. It's kind of hard.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.720]   You know, my son was 17 really wants to drive the Mustang. I'm not going to let him.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.040]   Oh, why not? Because he'll be wrapped around a tree. No, won't. Do you don't think so?
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:25.520]   Nah. Would you let JC drive a Mustang? Sure. V8. 350 horsepower. Yeah. He let him drive yours.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.160]   Yeah. That's why he wants it.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:34.400]   Kids are pretty good. As long as you, you know, it's not, you know, it's not, you don't have a
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.600]   stick shift though, right? Yeah. It's stick. It's the way it's done. A light drove it. I just don't
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.880]   remember. Oh, the stick is great. Well, you can drive a stick. Still make stuff.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.360]   Obviously I drove your car around. Well, you know, of course it's true. And I know automotive
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.640]   enthusiasts. Stig is going to get mad at me. But the modern automatic transmissions are much
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:55.120]   better than 10 times better. You can't worry has proven this with their race cars. You cannot
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:00.560]   drive as well, but it's sure more fun. You feel it. You feel like you're doing better. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:05.840]   And I think it's safer because I have to spend more alert. I'm aware I'm driving instead of just
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.800]   kind of going. I find it very difficult because you know, you have a coffee in one hand, you have
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.120]   your phone in the other hand. Yes, exactly. It's like, you can't difficult. All right. And so,
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.720]   this goes a mess. Oh, no, I'm real good now. I pull, I pull the handbrake. Oh, yeah, that's the
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.840]   trick. Yeah, pull a handbrake. I, I, I popped the clutch. It's great. I know how to do a hill. You
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:31.680]   could put me on a 90 degree hill and I could do it. What are you laughing at? 90 degree. All right,
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:39.360]   90 driving to heaven 70. And down shifting is fun. You're right. That's it. I know it's bad for
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   this. It's not bad for the car. It's bad for the clutch. It totally burns the clutch. I've gone
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.080]   through eight clutches. What? No, I haven't. Does I never go to sound shifting doesn't hurt. Not
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.440]   down shifting the popping the clutch when you're going up the hill of the pool pulling the. Oh,
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.880]   and riding it. Riding it. Yeah. Love that. That's not good. Love it though.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:02.880]   Um, irrational exuberance are thesis for this segment. Yeah. Yeah. This whole episode is about
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.280]   yeah. National exuberance. So I thought it was interesting. The Wall Street Journal ran an
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.880]   article. They've really been trying to tank the Facebook IPO from day one. They just hate Facebook.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:17.840]   I think buddy does. Consumer reports comes out with this news flash that people don't use proper
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.680]   privacy settings is like, well, that's obvious. Yeah, it's like, wait, there's eight thousand of
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.600]   them. When they review a phone, they're, they're like, people are talking irresponsibly about their
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:31.360]   affairs. And I was surprised by hello. The number was something like 13 percent or something. I never
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:36.240]   even thought that these guys, but it's it's just because these are competitors. That's that's to me.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.520]   Now when we've talked to Cara Swisher and others, she said, no, no, the editorial integrity, Wall
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:47.120]   Street Journal is unimpeachable. These reporters. Oh, yeah. Are not being told what to say by Rupert
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.360]   Murdoch. No, they're not. I agree with that. Murdoch's not going to be calling reporters up.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:57.600]   Hey, you know that Facebook. It's a bad idea. He's, he is Australia. Australia. Australia.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:06.080]   So he was German. What would he say? Oh, boom. That was my snare. Facebook is bad idea.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:11.040]   So the big doubt, look at the headline on the Wall Street freaking journal, the big doubt over
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:15.120]   Facebook. Well, look, I mean, as journalists, you have, you always have a little bit of showman
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:19.360]   in you and it's like, the obvious thing is everyone's really excited about the IPO. So if I'm writing
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.720]   a headline and I want to grab eyeballs, I'm going to make sure to say there a big doubt. Well, here's
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.040]   another fact. By the way, the big doubt they're talking about is that Facebook advertising doesn't
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.760]   probably doesn't work. Well, that's not true. Here's another thing. No, it's bogus. You should buy
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.640]   an ad in the Wall Street Journal. It's so much better. Go ahead. I believe also that there's a lot,
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.040]   there's a subtle hatred of the writers with Facebook because they don't get any access.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:49.280]   That's true. Not many people interviewed Zuckerberg. Scoble. Scoble. Scoble. Another reason you
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   can't write the journal. The journal said, who is this guy? Why does he get to talk to Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.760]   Who is this guy? Oh, look at all these photos he took. Actually, to be honest,
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.720]   Cara and Walt got a lot of FaceTime with Zuckerberg. Remember, they made him sweat and then and then
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.800]   Cara got it. Wasn't that on? Wasn't that on? It's all things to you, but that's not the same as
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.840]   getting the guy at his office. It's still a it's it's still a thing. And the other thing is there's
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:19.200]   something about exclusive. When you're a reporter, you want to get the guy in his office by yourself
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.920]   so whatever he says, you have exclusively, if you're doing on a big stage, these guys can run out
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.360]   and file the story before you even get off the stage. But in addition to the pettiness of the press,
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:35.600]   there's also some really interesting facts behind this skepticism, including one analyst pointed out
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:41.440]   that in order to justify its devaluation they're shooting for, they would actually have to grow
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:47.200]   41% per year over the next several years. Now, I don't know if I could accept all of his data,
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:50.560]   but anyway, that's the point compared to other I feel.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:55.200]   But that's based on their current revenue model, though, which there's so many.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.800]   You mean the numbers of users would have to grow? No, the amount of advertising revenue would have
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.880]   to grow. I don't think it's unreasonable just because I think they're sitting on a tremendous
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:12.160]   number of ways to monetize. Exactly. The reason we gradually scratch the surface of my room.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.520]   Taste of owns all of your secrets and the fact that they've only shaved them off the
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.480]   month of the month. They have done a ton of the blast mailing that they can do in the future.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.880]   There's lots of money in that. But see, there's another side to that. When you start screwing
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.600]   people for like to have that kind of 41% year over year growth, it's going to be, you know,
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.120]   it's going to change people off. Exactly. And now they're alternatives. Now that Google+
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.280]   exists. Now there's used to be they had no alternative. So it's not. I'll tell you,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.560]   stop. Absolutely. It's an all you know, you don't argue with the Empire, man.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:43.200]   You go to the Empire. You're talking to the Google+ man. That's right. Google+ is not an
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.520]   alternative to anything. Google+ is the Borg. They take a step forward and then the buzz that
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.280]   like you shoot off their arm and buzz. Seriously. Seriously. Mike, are you still as bullish
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:57.680]   as a little buzz? I'm bullish on it for my own personal selfish reasons, which is that it's the
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.880]   only social there that does everything that a blog does. It does what email does. It does what
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.520]   everything does all in one place. And I don't have time to chase social networks all over the planet
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.040]   and to post a little here and a little there. I don't know how you do it, Leo. I just post on
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.280]   Facebook. Well, it's because he doesn't do email. Anyway, but the point is that the point is that
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:19.600]   we'll talk about that in a second. In order to really squeeze every nickel out of all those
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.960]   900 million users, Facebook would have to become, you know, actually really push the envelope in
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:30.000]   terms of aggressive advertising and marketing toward their to toward their folks. And there's
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.400]   actually, you know, American pundits are always really down on Google+, Google+ is absolutely
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.800]   on fire in almost every country outside the US. Oh, that's true. It probably results.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.560]   Yeah. No, that's really interesting. They got to take that down.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.960]   Will you get that on the web? I get, I get, you know, another, I get tons of new followers every
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:55.040]   day, thousands of new followers every day. And 92 to 95% of them are outside the US.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:59.440]   And people are really using it. Well, and you see how that's totally global.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.360]   It actually shapes the narrative and the way you interact with Google+, because so many people
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.440]   are international. You'll notice that it's a very visual communication medium.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.840]   Rather than typing out your message, it's almost always better to take a photo of something to
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:17.760]   tell a story. Mike knows that. Look at this. I mean, photo, video, photo, photo.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.120]   Hey, it's your building. This is the last 20 minutes of your life.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.720]   Photo. What's my beer?
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.320]   Apparently posting during these entire show. Yeah. Who knew?
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.440]   Scoble.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.160]   Photo photo. Photo.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.960]   Photo. Photo. Scoble. What's that? That's kind of cool.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.880]   That's see visual medium. That's right. It's the arrest.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.160]   It just got you right in, didn't it? Yeah. I just feel like that.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.800]   That's a Pinterest. But I use it as a blog. It's a blog. As far as I'm concerned, plus,
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.760]   it's also social network to a lesser. How many followers do you have now?
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.600]   I have 1.1 million. Wow. I have less than 300,000.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:55.520]   I got like 40. Why do I have so few? Because you're not doing what he does.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.680]   You're not pushing it. I don't think it has anything to do with that.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.360]   Yeah. Well, I think I mean, it has to do with something called a suggested user list.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.600]   But the reason I do. Is there a suggested user list?
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.240]   But the reason I haven't heard about that? It's a scam.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.360]   One of the reasons I'm on it though, I think, is that I post, you know,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.120]   I tend to 15 items a day. I don't know why they took me off of it.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.480]   Anyway, it's not why I don't like it.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.240]   Because you sit on the show and bitch in Moan.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.120]   It's not why I like it. I just don't. I think Facebook is the place to be,
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.960]   and I'm not on their suggested user list either.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.920]   But the bigger issue is that it is an alternative, I think, for users,
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.400]   and it's going to be an alternative for advertisers.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.040]   They're going to roll out advertising, and it's going to be connected with
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.400]   Search and Yahoo and all that.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.760]   I mean, I was like, "It's clear that Google is going to use its muscle to make it work."
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.760]   Absolutely. But here's the way that regardless of whether or not-
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.600]   Work cut. Regardless of whether or not Google Plus is the alternative to Facebook.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:46.640]   The fact is, we have already seen a bubble emerge in social media and get utterly destroyed with
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:52.080]   Myspace only to be taken up with Facebook. You already have the concern about the fact that
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.440]   something's valued at a billion dollars with no physical product whatsoever.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:59.120]   And then you have the concern about the fact that we already watched a very fickle market,
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:03.280]   abandoned one platform virtually overnight to run to another one.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.320]   Myspace. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.800]   So that's the uncertainty. That's the uncertainty.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:12.880]   Facebook's S1 confirms they're going to ask for five to six point three billion dollars.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.560]   Four billion of that will go to Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.680]   That's nice. It must feel good.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.000]   One thing overlooked in this is Mark Zuckerberg himself.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.560]   Who was the guy that was the Myspace guy?
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:32.400]   Tom. Tom Anderson. He's also a person on with Trey Radcliffe now.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.200]   He is.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.800]   In fact, if you look at all his photos, they look like Trey Radcliffe photos.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.960]   He's stolen Trey Radcliffe's mojo.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:46.720]   I just want to point out that my profile on Facebook features a large picture of me with Tom Anderson.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.680]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.240]   Just a little inside joke there.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:54.160]   And it looks even better too because you look annoyed that he's hanging on to you.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.320]   I know. I don't want you guys holding hands.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:56.960]   I'm basically so...
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.880]   They're like Mr. Ligland's go away.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.160]   Go away. I got an idea for you.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.640]   Facebook over. It's all about...
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.080]   No, anyway, so this is the Facebook.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.840]   They did a road show. You know, when you do the IPO,
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:13.120]   you go around to the investors, the big institutions,
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.240]   and you make the case for why they should buy Facebook stock.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.200]   Yeah, it's called the road show.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.600]   The road show. They are not doing a traditional road show.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.200]   They're doing a net road show.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:23.920]   Oh, that's smart.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.760]   And here's the disclaimer that you have to either reject or accept.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.160]   How many people have read this?
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:30.880]   Nobody.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.560]   You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.320]   That's the bottom line right there.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.960]   US to go. Good. Look at this.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.880]   The US Securities and Exchange Commission urges you to read the preliminary perspectives
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.320]   before making an investment decision.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.680]   All right. All right. I just want to see Mark Zuckerberg in a t-shirt.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.520]   By the way, what you're doing right now is a very strong case for why there shouldn't even be
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.560]   these regulations. You're clearly not reading them. You're just like words, words,
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.360]   something where I give my mark.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.800]   Look at this. And now I have to see a crawl.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.600]   Six Star Wars.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.880]   Of the Star Wars crawl.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.960]   Of the same thing that I just agreed to.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.400]   All of this is required by the SEC.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.760]   I don't know if jobs will change this or not.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.360]   Not Steve Jobs with the Jobs bill.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:14.160]   But the point being Mark Zuckerberg does actually do a road show
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.440]   in a t-shirt on the web.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.320]   It's a flops and a...
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:22.240]   And in a way, this is an argument for the success of Facebook, the fact that they could even,
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.560]   this is the modern way of doing it, right?
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.880]   I think that in so many ways,
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.080]   Jesus is a long flop.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.960]   We are seeing the virtualization of our entire lives.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.200]   We are seeing virtual analogs to just about every aspect of real life, right?
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:41.120]   Down to, in fact, from a magic perspective, I'm trying to figure out how I can create something
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:46.720]   that would simulate local magic clubs, something with like a...
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.720]   Is this your... are you pitching me now?
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.600]   Yeah, let's go on.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.640]   Maybe I should, actually.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.720]   Like a Google Hangout type thing.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.560]   Can I read the perspectives before investing in the news?
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.240]   It's like, if you want to make money on the internet,
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.880]   all you have to do is look out and see what real life activities have not yet been virtualized.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.200]   Well, well, actually, to refine that idea,
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.280]   to look at what would be the experience would be improved or made cheaper
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.240]   for digitization.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.800]   Absolutely, because there are some things that will never be replaced.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.520]   It's improved by the fact that I don't even have to get my car to do it.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.960]   And that's all the improvement I need.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.160]   Does he look normal?
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.280]   No, his eyes have large...
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   He has this makeup thing around his eyes that's like white.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.040]   I did a post on this.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.680]   He doesn't look normal.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.960]   There's something weird going on.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.480]   There's a guy pointed at him.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.000]   The thing that seemed like a...
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.760]   Look at his face and tell him, imagine there's like three pistols themed at him,
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.680]   and he's like, I think Mark Zuckerberg's eyes are abnormally large.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.000]   I think his heart is that big, only large.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.040]   I think there was this spacing.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.880]   They're widely spaced.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.080]   He hasn't blinked yet, if you know that.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.600]   He also has a very low far head, which usually indicates...
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.560]   He has that one, now there is one.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.440]   Poor intelligence.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.120]   He does have nice biceps, however.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.360]   He's got a horse face, actually.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.000]   This is brutal.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Well, I'm just saying, I don't say it's a bad thing.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.400]   He doesn't eat anything that he doesn't kill himself.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.760]   Are we still right?
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.320]   Is that a fact?
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.600]   What?
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.200]   That's his thing.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.320]   He killed a buffalo, and now he's got a freezer full of buffalo meat.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.520]   He killed his chickens.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.440]   He killed his dog once, and now he's a dog meat.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.080]   No.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.280]   You guys are just putting me on.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:15.600]   No, no, no.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.240]   This is a real thing.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.600]   This is a news thing, Waga.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.160]   He's going to be...
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.440]   He's going to go to a whole food and buy a dead fish.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.720]   No, not unless he can kill it.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.080]   Maybe that's live.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.720]   So they go to Chinatown, though, where they keep the fish and the thing,
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.680]   and he has...
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.520]   Does he take the bat, you know, in the Chinese?
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.040]   They beat the fish in the store.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:31.840]   You ever seen that?
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.240]   I like it.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.520]   Evil IRC says, he killed privacy as we know it.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:35.840]   Now.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.920]   He's going to eat in his eating privacy.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.000]   [laughter]
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:40.320]   Nice.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.560]   I have no idea about that.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.120]   That's kind of...
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.080]   That's very interesting.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.560]   I respect that, man.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.200]   I think that's...
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.320]   I actually do respect that.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.680]   Yeah, until he starts hunting you.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.520]   Is that...?
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.320]   Catch me first.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.200]   Is that...
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:51.600]   What is that?
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.360]   The most deadly game?
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.320]   Yeah, the deadly skin.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.280]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.800]   Never knows.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.360]   Ever know.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.640]   Interesting story here.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.160]   Now, how much is ever know worse?
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.840]   I love Ever Know, and I've recommended.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.320]   In fact, once Phil Wibb and the CEO of Ever Know told me that
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:09.200]   4.7% of all the Ever Know downloads were because of me.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.000]   You?
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.400]   Really?
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.320]   Okay, now, how high piece of the action?
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:12.800]   No!
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.320]   Did you get a pen or a watch?
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:14.880]   That's insane.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.160]   Or a gift, a small box.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.680]   He said we source...
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.280]   You know, where did you hear about Ever Know?
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.920]   4.7% Leo Leport.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.480]   You should make Ever Know pay for all the new Devoract shirts.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.640]   I buy into the whole bunch of shirts.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.520]   Can I confess something?
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.360]   I have no idea what to do with Ever Know.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.320]   I've never used it.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.280]   I downloaded it.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:31.520]   What is it?
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.320]   I've never used it.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.120]   What is it?
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:33.680]   I've never used it.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.040]   Okay, so here's what it is.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.240]   It's a place where you...
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.800]   Think of it as cloud storage without files.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.520]   So you basically...
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.320]   You just click a button when you're on a website.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.560]   It takes that page and just stores it for you.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.440]   The coolest thing that Ever Know does is you take a picture of something.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.560]   I love this part.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.520]   You upload it and it actually OCRs the photograph.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.400]   So you can take the picture of...
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.520]   This is if you pay for a pro account.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.040]   Yeah, you can take a picture of a menu and then later search for hamburger
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.000]   and it brings up the menu.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.600]   So it's...
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.880]   Now, that would be kind of interesting.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.360]   Really cool.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.640]   So you use it.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.840]   I use it on a page user.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.160]   You have the pro account.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.280]   I have the pro account, yes.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.400]   So how much is the pro account?
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:06.960]   It's not much.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.520]   Oh, I don't remember.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.320]   So it's like...
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:08.960]   Yeah, it's like...
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.480]   The analog would be like this is a bionic memory.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.640]   Yeah, it's supposed to be a prosthetic memory.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.200]   Everything.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.000]   It's on your phone.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.800]   It's on your tablet.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.600]   It's on your desktop.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.640]   It's on your laptop.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.160]   And it automatically syncs everywhere.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.200]   So even...
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.280]   I use it in kind of weirdly trivial ways.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.520]   For instance, I wanted the API key for Bitly on my phone,
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.320]   but I didn't have...
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.520]   I couldn't get there.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.200]   So I surfed to it on the web,
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.720]   copied it, pasted it, and never note.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.640]   Seconds later it synced and I handed it on my phone
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.760]   and I copied it from the phone.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.640]   It's just weird that way.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.520]   You have all this information.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.800]   All the things that I'm doing right now
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.600]   just by emailing photos of crap or notes to myself.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.560]   Stored never note.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.040]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.000]   And there's plugins everywhere for every browser.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.760]   It's 4.7 numbers going up.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.000]   But here's why it's a great bit.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.200]   We're talking about the valuation.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.600]   Here's why it's a great value as a company.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.000]   Once they've got you, you're not going anywhere.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.400]   Right.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.000]   I mean, I've been just in several years.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.360]   It's like making my life in there.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.280]   And it's like I couldn't possibly stop using it.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.080]   You're screwed.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:02.880]   I'm screwed.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.000]   Well, that sucks.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.200]   Well, it's unless you're an investor because there's...
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.880]   No, man. So I can't get this data out.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.840]   I'm stuck with it.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.960]   No, no. You can get it out.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.680]   It's like a cloud. No, no. It's all RTFs.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.520]   It's always on every platform.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.880]   So I have everything here.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.160]   I can export it as an RTF.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:18.720]   But you won't.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.760]   You won't export it.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.960]   But you could. You could.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.080]   But then you lose the power of the smart database.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.200]   But you could put it in some other database.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.200]   The point is that they get you using it
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.120]   and it becomes really important to you
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.240]   and you can't really...
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.160]   Here's a recording that I put on Evernote.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.440]   So this is the other thing you can do
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.560]   is you can record audio.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.120]   Audio.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.920]   Yeah. So it's really...
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.120]   It's kind of a handy...
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.400]   You don't record enough audio?
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.400]   Well, no. I wanted to remember this.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.120]   Well, I'll tell you...
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.000]   I'm not hearing anything.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.560]   Is there any self-organization that it does?
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.200]   Any easy way to separate different thoughts and categories?
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.240]   It's got pretty good stories.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.080]   Well, you need to have a game and stuff like that.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:50.800]   It's a flat file.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.600]   Giant flat file.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.720]   You don't need to sort anything.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.080]   You just say, I want everything about...
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:54.720]   It does have...
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   It does have folders, but it's got it very faster.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.160]   And has tags, which I don't use because I'm lazy, but you can search.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.680]   I stored...
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.560]   I arrive at the parking lot going in Norway.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.160]   Took a picture of where I was.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.600]   It's Evernote when I get back.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.800]   You can't remember where you're parked?
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.360]   No.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.000]   Can you?
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.200]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:11.920]   Duh.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.280]   I get to a hotel.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.240]   I check in.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.200]   The room is there.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.160]   It's a room number.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.120]   I know I'm going to forget it.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.000]   I take a picture of it.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.440]   Smart.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.400]   I do that too.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.760]   You can't remember the room.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:21.920]   No.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.720]   Maybe we're a size...
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.520]   You get older.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.640]   You too.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.520]   You will discover.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.600]   Wow, you didn't... I just dropped a dude and you didn't jump on me for it.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.680]   I didn't hear it.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:31.920]   Is that...
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.240]   Is that...
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:32.320]   Is that...
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:32.400]   Is that...
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:32.480]   Is that...
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:32.560]   Is that...
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.440]   I heard it, I would have said something.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.040]   Is that a phrase the kid's cut?
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.840]   You're not gonna say every time I accidentally say, "Dude, he interrupts me."
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.720]   He goes, "Dude!"
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.440]   Dude.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.840]   That's because it's something you shouldn't be saying.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.520]   Why? Was it dirty word?
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.640]   No, it's just dumb.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.160]   I dropped a dude, man.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.520]   Is that something like a...
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.960]   Dude, is that something like a...
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.680]   Dump turn.
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.040]   Sounds like a bathroom reference.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:53.040]   Argue.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.240]   I'm gonna turn it over to the room now.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.360]   I gotta go drop a dude.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.240]   Drop the dude.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:56.960]   Dude, it's all bro.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.560]   Whatever, bro.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.120]   Broham.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.600]   You gotta relax, JCD.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.320]   Bro.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.840]   Relax, JCD.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.480]   Broham.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:12.800]   Ever know valued at a billion dollars based on their new funding.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.760]   Here's the thing is...
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.280]   Is this...
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:15.760]   Wow.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.240]   Wow.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.120]   Smarter or less smart than Instagram being a billion dollars.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.640]   It's worth more than Instagram, don't you think?
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.200]   I mean, my gut tells me that, but I don't know nothing.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.160]   Instagram has about a billion users.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.120]   Here's the thing.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.240]   They have some actual proprietary technology
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.560]   that's actually valuable and interesting.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.800]   The other thing is that they're about to go into China.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.720]   And if you look at Apple's recent report,
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.080]   it's all about China.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.360]   The manufacturing in China is...
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:39.760]   Yes.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.360]   ...beneficial for Apple on market.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:41.520]   Huge market.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.720]   And they haven't even cracked the big carrier in China.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.360]   So China is really making Apple what it is,
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.240]   the runaway success.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.760]   And it's gonna do the same thing forever, note.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.720]   The thing that freaks me out about it is the CEO
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.520]   of...
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.480]   Phil Lyman is fantastic.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.760]   Phil Lyman, they asked him,
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.000]   "Well, what about the Chinese government hackers
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.680]   getting in and getting everybody's data?"
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.840]   And he basically said, "Well, you can't really stop them,
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.880]   so we're not worrying about it."
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.200]   That's right, by the way.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.080]   He's right, but...
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.440]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.800]   It's not a good place to start.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.440]   It's not a good place to start.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.640]   It's something you don't have to worry about.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.120]   It's like finding a new thing in the haystack
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.000]   if you're looking for anything.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.640]   It's interesting because they raise the money,
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.760]   even though they don't need it.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.080]   Phil Lyman says, "We didn't raise the money because we have..."
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.920]   No, that's actually the money.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.520]   That's old school thinking.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.960]   Yeah, you raise money when you don't need it.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.160]   If you try to raise it when you need it...
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:26.800]   Yeah, you're screwed.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.360]   They screw you.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.360]   They take too much of the company.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.880]   Yeah, if you don't need it, they...
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.080]   So I should raise money now.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.760]   Maritec Capital, CBC Capital,
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.840]   putting in another $70 million,
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.400]   they'd already raised $96 million.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.800]   They got $156 million.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.000]   In the bank.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.520]   I'm sorry, $166 in the bank.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.000]   They should scan it and put it into Evernote.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.480]   Yeah, because they could access it whatever they wanted it.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.520]   So getting back to our original premise...
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.240]   This is a joke in their song.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.360]   Irrational exuberance?
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.360]   Hold on, you just blew my mind about scanning money and putting it in...
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.760]   Why can we not do that with currency right now?
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.200]   We do that with checks.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.600]   Why can't you print out your own money?
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.160]   Because you have to listen to our triangulation show from Wednesday.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.680]   We interviewed with his name Bill Harris.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.640]   I think it was Bill Harris.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.200]   Yeah, Bill Harris.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.080]   Of personal capital.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.320]   This is an interesting guy because he decided about 15 years ago
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.680]   that the next big transition was going to be in finance.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.480]   And he's former CEO at PayPal.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.920]   He was big at...
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   What was his second company?
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.640]   I can't remember.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.120]   Well, into it in PayPal?
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:33.680]   Into it.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.480]   And he started this personal capital.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.960]   But what he says is exactly what you say.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.840]   He said, "What's happening is physical media is going to disappear in finance.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.840]   There's no point of physical physical."
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.760]   Well, yeah, if you need cash, just print it out.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.120]   And each one, of course, has a individual...
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.320]   It could be called a check.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.280]   You could write it out too.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.320]   You know, on Sunday.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.040]   Look how we see it.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.400]   But look how you deposit a check now.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.760]   You take a picture of your phone.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.160]   No.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:56.640]   Why not?
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.240]   I do everything.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.120]   I do everything.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.480]   Do you use stamps?
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.520]   You probably use stamps.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.280]   You use stamps.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:03.680]   Do you?
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.440]   I wish I had a stamps.com ad.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.960]   I want cash with my own candy shop.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.880]   We had two opportunities for stamps.com.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.120]   All right.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.520]   I want to talk about security because I got to tell you,
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.400]   I read three articles this morning that gave me...
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.680]   That made me absolutely completely depressed.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.440]   The future sucks.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.400]   So unlike you.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.520]   Yeah, I'm normally optimistic.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.280]   Well, a cashless society should be one of those things.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.080]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.400]   Because then hacking you will be so easy.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.720]   Well, no, because everything will be trackable though.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.280]   You can't spend money with anyone knowing where to go.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.160]   And I think this is true.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.920]   It's an authentication issue.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.120]   If you have perfect authentication between buyer and seller,
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.520]   then there's no risk, right?
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.960]   Because I know your mic, I know I'm Leo, you know I'm Leo.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.120]   And so we can have that transaction.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:51.120]   That's where we kind of money and checks are kind of problematic.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.360]   But if you have an authentication, you can solve this.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.120]   Transactions can be saved.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.000]   Let's say we get to the point.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.640]   What if the government decides to just to take all your money?
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.200]   You got to...
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:09:59.840]   You got to trust...
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.240]   That's why...
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.440]   Okay, so that's why it's a true part.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:01.840]   You got to trust the government.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.640]   No, you don't.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.160]   Are you all coming down and trusting the government?
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.560]   Well, that's the craziest thing I've ever heard you say
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.760]   in four years of this show.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.440]   But that's what he actually believes.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.880]   And that's kind of what you believe.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.080]   What's that?
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.040]   Are you kidding me?
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.480]   No, look, here's the thing.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.240]   So let's say you get perfect authentication.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.840]   The first thing that's going to happen is you're going to have
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.800]   an alternate form of currency that's 100% anonymous.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.360]   Bitcoin.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:21.840]   For every...
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.560]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.880]   You're going to have a bit torrent of currency, basically,
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.880]   where it's completely shadow net and you have...
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.160]   You could spend your money on whatever you want.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:28.960]   Nobody's going to track you.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.440]   And that's a good thing, right?
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.080]   I'm just checking.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:32.720]   Okay.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.360]   Are you kidding?
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:33.920]   Just want to know.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.360]   Why are you looking to have you a bit?
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.000]   What?
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:36.960]   It's unbelievable.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.840]   What's unbelievable.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.200]   Not to go on to the internet.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.640]   Is he a pie-eyed optimist?
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.840]   I think we're going to say pothead.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.360]   [laughter]
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:43.760]   I did.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.160]   I think we're going to say...
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.360]   All right, I'm going to drop a dude and then we'll be back with more on John C.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:47.840]   Dvorak.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.320]   Oh, well, you got it.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.000]   Brian Brushwood, Mike Elgin.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.680]   This is the most disorganized twit we have ever done.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.800]   That's because the old reliable's here.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.800]   It's an old power book.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.840]   It's an old power book.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.720]   This is what I use to go on.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.160]   Like the 110, remember that?
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.400]   And now we know why you don't like Apple.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.760]   He's got flying toasters.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.720]   I love Apple.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.920]   Don't kid yourself.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.240]   Some...
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.840]   I keep getting a tweet from somebody who says,
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.880]   "Why do you have John on?"
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.200]   He's the guy who said nobody would ever use a mouse.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.080]   I never said that.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.000]   It was in 1984.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:16.640]   I wrote a column.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:20.480]   I, by the way, have reproduced this column with a photocopier,
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.520]   what it actually said was I was outlining 16 reasons
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.040]   while the Macintosh may fail.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.840]   And by the way, I did a secondary column three or four years later
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.720]   when Larry Tesla told us if I were all screwed up.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.560]   14 of them and the reasons were right.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.080]   And in the column, it said...
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.680]   One of the 16 reasons was a mouse.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.040]   There is no evidence...
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.000]   There's no evidence...
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.640]   That anyone wants to use these things.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.600]   It was new to the market.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.440]   And I didn't know whether it was going to go or not.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.200]   I just said there's no evidence.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.120]   Fast forward to July.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.200]   Last year, why Windows 8 might fail.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.280]   Same seven reasons.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.520]   Same seven reasons.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.360]   But you know, the difference is that the Apple...
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.160]   The Apple fanboys will never forgive John.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:02.560]   No.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.040]   Never.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.160]   They love it.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.200]   So yeah, well, okay.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.200]   So I recycle these types of columns.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.680]   You know what?
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.480]   You make a living.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.280]   You can't lose.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.960]   That's why you need Evernote.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.480]   You just scan all your columns.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:14.960]   Exactly.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   Until the Chinese get a hold of them.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.400]   Oh, we're in trouble now.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:18.720]   All right.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.360]   We're going to take a break.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:19.920]   Come back with more.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.120]   I want to talk about security.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.320]   I am not going to talk about Nokia suing people.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:24.960]   I don't care.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.680]   I am maybe going to talk about the fact that the FBI wants a
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.680]   backdoor in Facebook, Skype.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.880]   Oh, hell's the email.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.840]   And email.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.920]   The email stuff that you talked about on your show.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.280]   And we'll talk about email.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.880]   Is it causing stress in your life?
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.440]   This is...
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.320]   I got...
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.360]   I heard Leo do this on his radio show,
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.080]   and I realize it was a self-serving argument
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.680]   that was totally bogus,
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.720]   and I'm going to call him on.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.280]   Okay, good.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.360]   And then we're going to go gaming
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.760]   because Diablo 3 coming out.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.560]   And SkyRimMMO.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.720]   But we'll talk about that in just a little bit with...
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.280]   Schwood, Elgin and Devorak.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.200]   My law firm.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:03.680]   First...
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.840]   It is.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.320]   Sounds good.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.560]   I could see the receptionist now.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.320]   Schwood, Elgin and Devorak.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.360]   Schwood, Elgin and Devorak.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.080]   I can't even say it.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.800]   Schwood, Elgin.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.360]   I never mind.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.600]   I've had too many of these.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.800]   It's not the port.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.600]   It's the chocolate...
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.160]   It's on the back.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:18.400]   It's on the back.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.040]   It's on Coco.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.240]   I'm whacked on Coco.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.480]   Audible.com.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.800]   You know what I'm listening to right now?
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.280]   What is it?
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.240]   The stand.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.840]   Are you taking the plot?
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.560]   Awesome.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.920]   Are you diving all the way in?
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:30.720]   Awesome.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.440]   For years you could not get the complete uncut version you've never seen before.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.560]   And that's what I'm listening to.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.400]   It's like this giant 43-hour extravaganza.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:40.880]   So good.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.560]   That was the one that started me.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.800]   And you know that's all tied into the Dark Tower universe.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.200]   I know.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.600]   And you know I've been reading the Dark Tower on your behest.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.600]   The new Dark Tower has come out.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.680]   I can't do that one on Audible though.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.080]   Why is that?
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.680]   It's read by Stephen King.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:54.800]   Oh he's not a good reader?
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.960]   The Man in Black fled across the desert.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.320]   And the Gunslinger followed.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:58.960]   Oh no.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.600]   Hey that's good.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.400]   That's the first line.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.200]   I'm listening.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.320]   That's very good.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.920]   The wind through the keyhole is the newest Dark Tower.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.720]   Is he really near?
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.200]   Oh it is.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.720]   Let's just listen a little bit.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.760]   All right I'll give him the benefit of that.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.320]   Let's do this.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.360]   The flat main accent.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:11.680]   Let's do it.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.640]   Stephen King ladies and Joe.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.240]   By the time Canfield, the Jefferson Ranch's newest prodigy,
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.600]   which is to say hired hand, reached the home place,
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.120]   the screaming had stopped.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.960]   He's got a speech impediment I admit.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.400]   But there's a certain authenticity to the...
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.680]   It's his the man's words.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.600]   And he's the greatest writer of our time.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.080]   Yes.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.120]   He's certainly when all the best writers
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.240]   tend to be the most prolific.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.960]   I mean have you read his book on writing?
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.080]   It is phenomenal.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:38.560]   It's called on writing.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.080]   It's like it's wonderful.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.960]   Yeah no.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.000]   He talks about how you should never use adverbs.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.600]   Because if you need to use an adverb,
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.920]   it's because you're not painting the rest of the picture properly.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.960]   You know what's funny?
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.760]   I was listening to 1122 63 full adverbs.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:52.160]   Isn't it?
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.040]   Yes.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.960]   And every time there was an adverb I'm going,
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.560]   Stephen, shame on you.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.680]   Shame on you.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.200]   Mr. King have you learned nothing.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.640]   You raised yourself better than this.
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.800]   The stand is really good.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.280]   It really is.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.400]   You know what I like about the stand?
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.920]   It is 47 hours.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:06.800]   56 minutes.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:07.920]   Let's call it 48 hours.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:14.960]   It is a lot of different stories tied together with a theme.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.480]   And I love it because your list,
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.480]   what you're listening to is a master storyteller
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.760]   in a sisketches.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.280]   Because some of these stories are one page,
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.720]   two pages, three pages.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:26.080]   And he is so brilliant at characterization, story plot,
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.080]   just plain writing.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:28.560]   You know what I mean?
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.560]   That each of these stories has a life of its own.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.160]   These characters live.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.680]   And he only has a, it's like watching Picasso paint.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.720]   It's amazing.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.280]   What I also love are stories that start off as one tail,
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.320]   but become another tail.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.800]   So when you begin, you're seeing an apocalyptic
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.640]   kind of a collage of the destruction of humanity.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.520]   The end of the world.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.120]   That's the premise of the stand is it's a
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.760]   flue that was created by the army.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.320]   Right.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:52.880]   Pandemic, right.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.360]   Pandemic.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.800]   And then you have a second chapter that's all about sort of this
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.600]   very non supernatural restructuring of society,
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.120]   how we all get along, where we,
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.840]   how we set up the rules now that everything's gone to crap.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.080]   And then the third chapter is classic Stephen King.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:11.440]   Are they the end act is all this very supernatural end of the world.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.960]   How's it going to turn out kind of thing?
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.800]   Not entirely unlike the show, actually.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.840]   Exactly.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.960]   Act three coming up in which we end the world.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.480]   Oh, sorry.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.040]   Save the world.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:21.760]   I got it.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.200]   It's the Dr. Evil chair at just every time.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:28.960]   So look, what what is audible audible is a bookstore of audio books,
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.560]   a hundred thousand strong.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.880]   You can buy the books.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.240]   Allah carte, of course.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.600]   I liked I have a subscription.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.560]   You know, I have a subscription, but I still buy some books.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.360]   All I call you.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.240]   Well, because I'll go through and I like to have two or three credits
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.360]   available at any time.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.120]   Oh, you don't want to spend your credits.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:45.680]   Well, exactly.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.720]   I like having the backup.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.120]   So it's like I'll get a run out and all of a sudden I'll I always look at the price of the book
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.920]   and if some of the books are only 10, 11 dollars, just buy them.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.200]   And I'm like, yeah, let's just go.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.560]   But then another one's like 20 dollars.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.080]   I'm like, oh, I'll do better with the credit.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:58.400]   Boom.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.600]   Then I buy it on the credit.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.000]   Boom.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:00.800]   Dude.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.280]   Bro, 20 great ways to use your credits right at the top there.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.880]   You could look at that audible.com.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.760]   They've got 20 wonderful books to start you off, including Stephen King's latest,
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.480]   11, 22, 63, actually, so no longer his latest.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.360]   Man, that guy is prolific.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.320]   He's got a really good book.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.040]   It was it's good.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.640]   Did you like the ending of that one?
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.200]   I did.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.840]   Traditionally, he doesn't do well at the endings, but I thought he really nailed it.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.360]   We're talking about 11, 22, 63.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.800]   I think we talked about this last time.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.640]   It was his son who came up the ending, not him.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.440]   Oh, that's right.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.640]   He credits his son.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.000]   I think it's very interesting.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.800]   It is wonderful.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.440]   Oh, and I misspoke.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.280]   It was lock and key is the comic book that Joe Hill does, which is a very good need.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.240]   Thanks for the correction.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.400]   Boy, there's some.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.480]   Oh, the name of the wind, Patrick Rothfuss.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.680]   Oh, have you read it yet?
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.600]   It's on my, uh, it's on my iPhone.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.440]   Oh, no, it's believe the hype.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:45.920]   It is.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:50.560]   I've never seen such an awesome, consistent universe where magic makes sense.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:50.960]   You know what?
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.520]   I stopped.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   I was going to listen, but I would have just finished Clash of Kings, and I thought I
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.800]   can't go into another one.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.880]   Yes, it is similar.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.240]   I'm listening to the stand as an anodyne to cleanse the palette.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:09.040]   It's a rather long and moves, and then I shall continue on with Patrick Rothfuss.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.320]   But you see now, this is what happens when audible listeners get together.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.880]   It's like, oh, but you got to have you tried the right.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.000]   I'm telling you, you're missing.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:16.880]   You do the other one.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.120]   I know you're missing out if you're not an audible subscriber.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.320]   So here's the deal.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.680]   You get two books free.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.120]   What's going to happen if you go to this is the deal that we have only for Twit.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.720]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.440]   That's the platinum account, two books a month.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.480]   That's my that's what I do.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.480]   And the first month is free.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.520]   The first two books are free.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.480]   You get two credits.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:38.000]   So Clash of Kings is two credits, but most of the books are one credit.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.840]   I think even the stand is one credit.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.560]   No way.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:40.960]   I can't.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.760]   48 hours.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.480]   No, I can't.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.680]   Usually it's based on length.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.800]   I don't know.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.360]   Try it out.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.480]   Audible.com.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.560]   Well, you can get the stand because it's two credits.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.160]   The stand is one-
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.480]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.440]   And really for anybody who wants to do the Great Dark Tower experiment,
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.960]   because Tom, I got Tom Merritt to do it.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.080]   Should you start with the stand?
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.520]   Start with the stand because it will stand completely on its own.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.160]   It's one of his very best works and it sets the framework for some interesting things
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.280]   that happen later on.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.400]   Now, I read the stand in a paperback that was eight inches thick many years ago,
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.360]   but it's fun to go back.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.200]   And you know, it's funny how little I remember.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.240]   So I'm actually enjoying it.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.600]   The Dark Tower, there are seven of them.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.560]   I have already read the first three.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.680]   I'm at Wizarding Glass.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.600]   So I'm going to the stand.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.520]   Okay, so you're in the groove at this point.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.120]   I'm already in the groove.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.560]   I got past the lobster things.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.480]   You didn't like the lobster.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.520]   You didn't like the lobster.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.000]   That was not good.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:30.960]   Lobstrosities.
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.520]   Lobstrosities.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.640]   Did it kick that attack?
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.200]   Did it kick that attack?
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:33.680]   Did it jump?
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.160]   Did it jump?
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.840]   Actually, I guess I did like it because it worked.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.800]   It scared that a lot of it.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.480]   Yeah, clearly it stuck with you.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.760]   Anyway, you gotta try it.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.120]   I don't know why I mean doing it.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.400]   I shouldn't have to sell this.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.920]   I should just say everybody go get your free books at Audible.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.720]   Just remember the code.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.680]   I haven't heard the code yet.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.320]   Twit2.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.960]   Audible.com/twit and the number two.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.640]   And I guess it goes without saying it.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.920]   So playing all sorts of devices, they have iPhone, Android.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.800]   The Windows phone is coming any minute now.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.920]   Paul Thorett has the beta.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.280]   It's really sweet.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.480]   I do like using the clients,
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.720]   but you can also sync it up with iTunes because
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.960]   it also supports it that way.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.640]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:18.080]   So, FBI says, we want back doors.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.200]   We want wiretap-ready websites.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.600]   We want a way to see what you're doing on Facebook
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.800]   and they've been lobbying Yahoo.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.920]   They've been lobbying Google.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.960]   They're quietly meeting with Microsoft.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.600]   Talking about Hotmail and Skype.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.120]   They're quietly meeting with Facebook.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.800]   They want a government, a legislative proposal.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.360]   It was drafted by the FBI that would require
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.280]   social networking sites and VoIP like Skype,
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:46.720]   instant messaging and email providers to alter their code
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.360]   to make their products wiretap friendly.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:54.160]   You know, it just breaks Skype.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.000]   It's just stupid.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.080]   Breo, tell me what it breaks is my freaking heart.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.560]   What kind of the hell country is this anymore?
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.520]   It's the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act,
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.280]   which was passed in 1994.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.120]   That requires all phone systems to be wiretapped-ready.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.120]   All right, let's argue.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.040]   And you could get it into this too.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:13.520]   Do you care?
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.400]   They're already wiretapping everything.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.520]   Well, okay, and that's the thing.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.560]   But here's the argument.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.040]   There's bad guys doing stuff on Facebook.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.720]   Wait a minute, that makes no sense.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.760]   So, there's bad guys doing stuff on Skype
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.680]   that we can't listen to because we're the FBI
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.320]   and we don't have the technology because it's encrypted.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.280]   And we can't hear them so we can't arrest them.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:40.320]   Look, I mean, I don't even know to get a court order.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.800]   Well, I mean, well, nobody, they can get a court order,
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.880]   but it doesn't help because Skype is encrypted.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.920]   They're telling Skype, Microsoft, you got to rewrite the Skype.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:48.480]   There's a problem.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.920]   No, it's all of our problem because bad guys are bad for all of us.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.760]   Well, that's the old argument.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:54.560]   Everyone's a bad guy.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.000]   There's probably some bad guy lurking.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.920]   Why don't we just put a camera in everybody's house?
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.800]   Yeah, the question is like you hear this kind of thing
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.400]   and they make a very compelling argument of like,
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.920]   no, it would be really easy for us to catch more bad guys.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.560]   And that's true.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.840]   It would make it way easy.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.800]   It would also make it way easy for you to vastly overstep
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.400]   the bounds of your car.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.040]   Yeah, make it easy for anyone that back door is in,
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.560]   which is essentially what we're talking about.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.120]   Why don't we just take Schmuck could probably tap into it
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.760]   because there's hacktings away from the police.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.200]   In fact, why don't we just take the cars away
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.560]   because it makes it easier for them to arrest good guys as well as bad guys.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.800]   Why don't we just eliminate police?
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.000]   We just get into more specious arguments, which are off top.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:32.720]   It's not specious.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:33.600]   Totally.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.800]   How is that specious?
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.280]   We're saying give the law enforcement officials the tools they need to apprehend
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.320]   your criminals.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.320]   And you're saying, well, don't give them tools
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.640]   because they might apprehend innocent people as well.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.000]   But that's always the case.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.080]   Okay, here's the thing.
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:50.320]   It is very, very important to have good.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.480]   So by your logic, they should just shoot everybody.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.040]   Yeah, no, that's exactly what you're saying.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.240]   No, I'm saying it is accepted practice.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:03.200]   You give law enforcement officials tools they need to enforce the laws
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.760]   and you have to have safeguards, obviously, like court oversight
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.960]   so that they don't overstep and do it go on fishing it.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:15.440]   We do have the, what is it, the Fourth Amendment protects us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.000]   That's right.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   That's that's in the Constitution.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.040]   I understand that.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.400]   But we don't we don't then ellipse, strip away all powers from law enforcement
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.360]   because we don't trust that.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.320]   What specific, except for Skype, what specific specific.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:33.360]   Specific website or blog or any of these things, do they need to have some special access to
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:39.120]   that you can't get with web copy or or black widow or any of these crawlers.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.040]   They're basically just trying to make it quicker.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.040]   If they know, no, no, okay.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:43.600]   Well, it's okay.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.720]   Facebook, you're right.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.760]   Facebook, they probably could get this.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.160]   Well, the Facebook does have privacy controls, right?
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.560]   So they probably still need a court order to see what's going on.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.320]   The FBI is working at Facebook.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.560]   I mean, don't just remember that 60 minute show in Mueller.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.360]   Right.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.120]   Now, let's talk about Skype and instant messaging because there's encrypted instant messaging.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:23:59.440]   Sure.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.320]   I'm a bad guy.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.960]   I want to communicate with you, John, because we're going to play in a bank robbery.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.200]   Okay.
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.520]   So now I know the FBI's got a back door.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:09.360]   So now I'm going to just send you encrypted messages that are encrypted by me and that you
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.480]   hold the key to.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.640]   So the Skype encryption means nothing.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.720]   Well, because I'm going to bypass the whole system.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.680]   What do they get to do?
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.720]   What my friends in law enforcement tell us is, of course, a smart bad guy can get around
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:25.440]   anything by using, say, true crypt, but most bad guys are stupid.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.160]   And we know that which means you're probably not using Skype.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.360]   Well, they might be.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:34.000]   We just want to make sure that we have the means to wiretap them in case.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.080]   So why are you not outraged by this, John?
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:36.880]   This is what I don't understand.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.680]   Like, like, I understand.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.840]   Yes, it's an effect on that outrage.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:40.160]   It's not.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.920]   Oh, you guys are both crazy.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:47.440]   Look, the thing is there is a constant push pull between this, this privacy hygiene that
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.800]   was so important to the founding fathers that they wrote it into the M.F.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.600]   Incostitution.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.200]   It's another four right on the list.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:53.680]   Agreed.
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.840]   But they also said that there should be law.
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.680]   They didn't say there's no law enforcement.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.280]   And a law enforcement needs tools.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.200]   They said it's a checks and balances.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.400]   Law enforcement has tools.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.240]   The difference is, is it should it be legal to have private conversations that you can
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:08.720]   guarantee are private electronically?
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.440]   That's the question.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:14.320]   So every time that I can't do that on the phone right now, I categorize this in a larger
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.600]   phenomenon, which is that every time there's an advancement in technology,
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.840]   authorities, law enforcement, government, and so on, use the advancement of technology
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:27.600]   to seize additional powers for themselves, to tip the balance in their favor between
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:30.240]   the public's rights and their own capabilities.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.000]   And this is yet another example.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.120]   So every time we move forward with technology, they grab more.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.760]   And so it gets to the point where they can listen to everything.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.640]   It's not that they're listening.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.840]   It's not just a bunch of FBI agents sitting in Washington listening to this.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:46.720]   I don't want to conflate a fishing expedition, which we agree is a bad thing.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.200]   That is clearly prohibited by the Constitution.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.400]   We're not talking about law.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.600]   But they do it.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.560]   We do it on telephones and they want to be able to do it on Sky 2.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.040]   Well, okay.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.200]   And I will fight your right against the Patriot Act.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.200]   I don't think law enforcement should be allowed to fish in the sense that libertarian.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:01.720]   Here's.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.800]   If there is no evidence of wrongdoing, here's the difference.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.360]   That we can then use these tools to look for it.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.120]   And that is unconstitutional.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.480]   That should always be wrong.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.600]   But we're not saying that.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:16.960]   We're saying if a duly constituted official of the government wants to thinks that there
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.840]   is a crime being committed, he goes to a judge and says, your honor, here's the evidence
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.800]   for a crime being committed.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.040]   I would like a wiretap.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.440]   This is the process.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.640]   And the judge says reviews it, gives checks and balances.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.840]   This says, okay, I agree you have probable cause.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.920]   Go ahead and do that wiretap.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.240]   Now we can do it in phones.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:39.760]   The issue that the law enforcement has is that there are now technologies that they
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.200]   can't tap.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.720]   And they want to have the same situation they have with phones.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720]   So here's the thing.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.000]   Should we not have wiretaps on telephones?
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.640]   Well, here's the here's the difference, right?
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.520]   Is the difference is is the same ability has always existed.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.800]   If the government suspects you of a specific crime and gets a warrant, they can go and
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.640]   ask you to open any single thing and check inside.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.680]   And that's always the way it's been.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:06.400]   All this would allow them to do is to snoop without ever tipping you off.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.640]   And it's important.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.200]   Sunlight has a sanitizing effect.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.200]   I agree that's wrong.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   Everything in the open.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.200]   I agree that's wrong.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.680]   And I agree the Patriot acts is wrong and the Pfizer courts are wrong.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:15.960]   I'm not I'm not denying that.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.160]   I think fishing expeditions are wrong.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:21.120]   But let's what are you going to turn this around?
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.720]   Let me turn this around.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.720]   Why is it not appropriate for them to get a warrant and say we really think you're planning
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.480]   a crime on Facebook, please open up your account and let me take a look because the
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.000]   judge what the judge will say is, okay, I need probable cause.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.640]   I need your evidence that there is a crime.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.360]   It's the same standard of evidence.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.080]   Either way, the only difference is one, you actually knock on my door and make me be the
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.080]   one to open it up.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.840]   The other one, you don't even inform me and go snooping around on myself.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.480]   No, no, no, I'm talking about a wiretap.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.120]   Let's say there is there is we do this now.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.600]   There's phone wiretaps, right?
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.600]   Is there?
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.600]   What?
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.600]   No, I'm teasing.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.600]   So you're right.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.600]   I'm not searching seizure.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.600]   That's different.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.440]   I'm talking about a phone wiretap that's legal.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.960]   There is an oversight situation.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.560]   There's a way this works.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.400]   All they're saying is we want the same capabilities.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.720]   The problem is we have these systems that we no longer can tap, but you can do that
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.600]   in ways that don't require all of these internet businesses to be in on the act to
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.200]   make the person on it.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.200]   Now that's a good point.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.200]   You can already handle that.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:19.080]   That's a good point because what we're now saying is you must change the technology to
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.080]   give us a backdoor.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.480]   Yeah, get a warrant and go stick a USB stick out there that does a key longer.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.480]   All right, you win.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.480]   You're right.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.480]   You don't need any more laws for this.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   You made the right argument.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.240]   But I think there's something else that needs to be mentioned is that the real reason
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:36.560]   that you want these back doors of your government, especially into something like Skype, is that
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:43.360]   whether we like it or not, the NSA with their various nodes around the country essentially
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.400]   just sucking up everything on the internet for future analysis.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.360]   And they can't suck up anything from Skype.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.360]   That's the ultimate fishing expedition.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.000]   You're talking about things like echelon, which do key things.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.800]   Every word, and then going and then doing everything brush root woods up to to find out
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:02.240]   that he lied on his resume.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:08.000]   Sometimes back when we circle, I made up a plan to honors program.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.800]   By the way, you don't believe me.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:21.640]   Just say bomb falafel hummus American warlords on the phone and see what happens.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.640]   Nothing.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.840]   Absolutely nothing.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.160]   So you know, you do people have tested this.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.560]   There's a lot of weird kind of monitoring going on your credit card.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.880]   If you go and if you want to get your credit card killed on the spot, you do the following.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.720]   And this was told to me by the one time CEO of American Express.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.960]   I'm going to back it up because I did it the other day and then killed my credit card.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.400]   You go and you buy two tanks of gas.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.400]   Two, not one.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   Two tanks.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.200]   You got to have your friend like grab your wife, drive up and you drive and fill up one
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:56.920]   car, fill up like 40, 50, 60, 60 gallons, fill up the other tank, which is tough when
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:30:00.280]   you have a truck that has two tanks by the way.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:05.400]   Then by a pair of Nike's, your card will be dead on the spot.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.080]   Will it work with Air Jordans?
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.760]   Well, Air Jordans, whatever.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:09.760]   Why?
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:13.400]   Because they believe the card was stolen and the first thing a guy-
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.720]   Because African Americans love athletic shoes.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.480]   No, this is a racist.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.480]   It's a very racist thing.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:22.360]   The first thing that people do is they buy gasoline for their car and the second thing
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.280]   they do is buy some gasoline for their bike.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.440]   It's racist.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.240]   And then they go buy sneakers.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.920]   And you go do it and you'll get your card filled.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.120]   But I have to say, this is all statistical and it's just what they know.
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.120]   Yeah, they don't know.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.120]   Nine times out of the day.
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.440]   You're a bad guy.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.880]   So you can have your card accidentally.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.520]   And so this is okay with you, but the FBI wire having a fact-
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.920]   I didn't say it was okay.
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:43.920]   It's disgusting.
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.720]   Oh, thank you.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:49.840]   Anyway, short version, too long, did not read.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.800]   The fact is, is there already exist ways to get any information they want and there's
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.840]   no need to decide that it's somehow-
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.840]   I think you made a good point.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.400]   On all of the companies to participate.
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:01.480]   I think you've made a good point and I will back down.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.480]   You are correct, sir.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.680]   And I will give you a back rub.
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.680]   Mm.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:06.680]   Okay, this is getting weird.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.680]   It's bro.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.880]   I don't want to be sitting between the two.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:15.280]   The new studying, new study at the University of California, Irvine and US Army, a joint
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.040]   effort.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:21.520]   They found some office workers who were willing to give up their email.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.960]   Actually, they said the professor did the study, said actually it was really hard to
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.120]   find office workers who give up their email.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.160]   So we went to their bosses and the boss said it's okay.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.400]   You don't have to get email.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:35.400]   We found that when you remove email, says Gloria Markin, from Alex Professor at University
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.800]   of California, Irvine, we found that when you remove email from workers' lives, they
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.960]   multitask less and they experience less stress.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:50.240]   And in fact, people with email switched windows an average of 37 times an hour.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:52.080]   I heard your whole thing on this.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.880]   People with it- well, for those who didn't listen to the radio show, may I just complete
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:56.880]   this?
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.880]   Yes, you may.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:01.560]   I'm sorry, because I got scolded by various emails saying, "You can't be picking on
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:04.040]   Leo for his radio show.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.360]   He does the radio show for a different audience."
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.760]   That's true.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.800]   But now that you're in my audience, I think you have the right to tell the facts of the
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:11.800]   radio.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:16.400]   So those who have email switched windows 37 times an hour, those who did not, they were
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:22.000]   on an email vacation 18 times an hour, the professor, the writer, and the old, they tested
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.160]   the cortisol levels.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.160]   The stress chemical levels in these people.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.320]   And it was through the roof!
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.320]   I don't buy it.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:35.640]   This Leo is why I love Google+, I have one stream for emails.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.720]   Also, I don't switch to Twitter, I don't switch to-
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.800]   How often do you check Google+, I never stopped checking it.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.440]   One's checking it, he just posted again.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:53.080]   One third of my screen is Google+, I never stopped checking it.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.080]   And you don't find that stressful?
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.080]   Not at all.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.080]   I'm very too hot.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.080]   It's calm?
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.080]   It's like a river.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.080]   It's sort of like plugging in in the Matrix where you just want to point out-
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:04.280]   Where you just want to read the raw code that you used to redirect elgin.com to Google+
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.280]   you don't do that.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.280]   I will, I will.
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.280]   Have you lost faith?
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.280]   No, it's a temporary glitch.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.080]   I'm switching to hover.com.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.280]   Oh, all right.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.280]   And they'll take care of it.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.280]   What is hover?
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.280]   It's a hover.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:15.280]   I never heard of it.
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.280]   It's another advertising.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.280]   It's another advertising.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.280]   But not for the show.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.280]   Who didn't pay?
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   Well, we love online advertisers.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.280]   You should use hover.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.840]   You should use stamps.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:27.840]   So you think that this is somehow less stressful because it's-
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:28.840]   Why?
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.840]   Because it's one thing.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:30.840]   I'm not switching.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:36.000]   I used to be on 12 to 15 social networks plus email plus AOL chat.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.440]   This is why it's less stressful.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.440]   That's the-
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.280]   See how peaceful that is?
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.280]   That's very peaceful.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.960]   But I use it instead of email.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   I use it instead of text messages.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.360]   It's got a picture of an island.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360]   I use it instead of-
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360]   Is there email on that phone?
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:48.360]   Is there email on that phone?
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.360]   If you post something-
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.800]   If you look like you just landed on the island, he's like, "This is a real thing."
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800]   This is my island.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.800]   I have a feeling about to get voted off any second now.
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:04.280]   No, if you address a Google+ post to somebody who doesn't use Google+, they get an email.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.440]   They get an email.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.760]   And then the email links them back to the post.
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:11.640]   They post on the post and you sit there and have essentially a chat conversation instead
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.640]   of email.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.320]   Are you curious just when I look at your site and you see that I have you in three circles?
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.720]   Are you at all curious what circles you're in?
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.680]   I don't want to know because I'm afraid of the answer.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.680]   Do you realize that, bro?
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.040]   I think a circle has like 400 people in it.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:30.320]   I think it's called Awesome People Who I Have No Idea Why I'm Falling.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.000]   Can I guess who they are?
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.880]   You have them in Shote Guest?
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.400]   Tech Journalists, I have them in.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.440]   You have been Tech Journalists and Friends.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:44.040]   Technology and Best of G+, Best of G+, Best of G+, Best of G+, He is not in Friends.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.920]   We actually have a circle called Best of G+, I probably-
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.920]   I have one too, but I'm the only one in it.
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:53.080]   I do have a circle called Sexy, but you're not in that.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.080]   I don't know why.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.080]   You have a whole bunch of people in that one.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.920]   It's like, well, Sexy.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.920]   I'm not in it.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.920]   Let me just take care of that.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:00.920]   Who's in Evernote?
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:01.920]   Okay.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:02.920]   Put him on Sexy.
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:06.880]   Evernote Circle, I think shares what I put there to Evernote.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.400]   I believe that's how I set that up.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.400]   It works?
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   I don't know.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.400]   I never use it.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.640]   I don't like what- Well, let's get back to the email topic because this is what I think
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.800]   is going on.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.680]   You, you said, "Well, this is interesting.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:18.840]   Now I know this and that."
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:19.840]   You went on and on and on.
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:20.840]   I was right.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.640]   I am right not to get email.
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.640]   That's what- It's impossible for you to say that.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.640]   See how stressed that is.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:28.640]   See how stressed that is.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.600]   Because you do not look at your email.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.240]   You say, "Oh, I check your toys today."
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.320]   Can I- It's Bullcrap.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320]   You never look at your email.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.080]   I never respond to anybody with email.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.440]   So you don't even use email.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.920]   So to be making these value judgments based on this Bullcrap story done by the army, which
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:44.920]   seems dubious.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.840]   You know why the army's doing it?
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.080]   They want to send email to the soldiers on the front.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.080]   I'm sure they do.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.600]   And so they're trying to figure out if this will increase their stress level.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.200]   They're in combat.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.200]   Okay.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.200]   Right.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:02.000]   So this is about as bogus as any topic you've ever discussed on your tech guy or whatever
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   you call yourself.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000]   I'll tell you this one though.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.840]   Leo has- He's ruined me for email.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.640]   Like after listening for two years about how you talk about like, "Hey, emails come in.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:11.640]   Some of them are my grabs.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.640]   Some of them not so much.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.520]   Like I've been infected with that bad habit."
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.360]   I no longer feel any obligation.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.700]   I will check email, but I don't feel any- I still think you got this from the radio.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:23.040]   Because I, one time we were doing, I think we were doing a show together.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.040]   It was years ago.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:29.900]   And there was some old radio hack that was running one of these other, he ran some game
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.140]   online gaming or something.
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:32.140]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.140]   That guy.
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.140]   And so he's sitting there.
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:36.140]   All these, these messages are coming in.
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.680]   He says, "Uh, he's just hanging up on him.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:39.680]   Like a maniac, which is what you used to do."
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:41.680]   Just, "Oh, I don't like the guy's name.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.680]   Oh Bullcrap."
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.680]   Just hang up on him.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:44.680]   Hanging up, hang up, hang up.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:45.680]   Oh, Judy's on.
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.680]   Let me talk to her.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:51.080]   So, meanwhile, this is what you just have to do.
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:52.080]   She sounds cute.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.800]   The exact same thing with my email.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.280]   You would like, you would actually love.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.240]   In fact, you should play Kevin Pollock's, you know, chat show.
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:05.520]   They have a game on it where they do a Larry King game.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:11.080]   Where you come up, where you come up with like the weirdest possible subject.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:15.920]   And then you go, and then you come up with a funny name and a city that they're from.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.720]   And it's like you're doing it as Larry King.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.720]   It's very funny.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.720]   It doesn't come up.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.720]   New Mexico, Iran.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.720]   Right.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.160]   But in the subject, anyway, it's a funny bit.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:34.120]   If you ever listen to the
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:41.120]   anybody have anything else, anything else that they want to talk about, anything else that's
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.120]   exciting.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.120]   I don't know.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.120]   You were talking about video game stuff.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.120]   We got the $9 Xbox coming out.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.120]   Which is a rumor, not true.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.120]   We don't know.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.120]   It does sound as though this is the idea.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.760]   But the idea is to a monthly subscription so you can continue to use your Xbox.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:54.760]   It's subsidized, right?
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.760]   So it's like now.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.960]   You get the connect and the Xbox for 99 bucks.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.960]   Right.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.680]   But you pay 10 bucks a month or something.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:01.680]   15 bucks a month.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.680]   And but.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.680]   I think it's smart to your idea.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.680]   Why?
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:07.680]   I think it's a good idea.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.680]   You end up paying more.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:09.680]   A lot more.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.960]   If you had just bought everything right up front, you would do better.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:15.240]   But in order to do that, you would have to decide to yourself.
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:18.520]   This is one of those things about accountability and the way we perceive ourselves.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:24.000]   Like if you're going to invest $400 in an Xbox, a connect and two years of Xbox Live,
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.240]   you will identify, self-identify yourself as a gamer.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:32.080]   And what Xbox has to deal with the fact is that they are a very valuable media consumption
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:35.360]   device or device for people who don't perceive themselves as gamers.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.040]   You got HBO Go is an app on Xbox available.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.920]   You got to Netflix for these things.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.320]   I think it's the Insta-
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:43.320]   It's to replace the cable bill.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.440]   For people who could be seduced, like they're just paying.
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.840]   Keep in mind this is only retail outlets.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.840]   Well, it's only $100.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.840]   Exactly.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.760]   And they're like $100 and 15 bucks a month.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.760]   Yeah, sure.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.760]   How much did web TV cost?
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:56.080]   I don't pay a lot of games, but it seems like that would be fun.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.080]   And so they jump in and do it.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.640]   I think this is a very smart move on their part.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:01.200]   From a marketing perspective, it's still a bad purchase.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.240]   And most of the people listening to this show would not go near it.
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.240]   Yeah, probably.
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.520]   And I think that there's a certain resistance to a yet another $15 a month bill.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:09.520]   Sure.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:10.520]   That we can't underestimate.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.520]   Even Granny and Grandpa know that.
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.080]   Do you want another $15 a month bill?
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.360]   We have too many already.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.360]   That's true.
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.360]   But again, you don't think about those things.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:22.440]   You think of, oh, I've always liked the Xbox and it's only $99.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440]   Finally, I can jump in.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440]   Jay Spin in our chat room.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:28.560]   It says it's the same morons who buy rent to buy rent to own furniture.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.560]   Sure.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.560]   No.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.560]   That's a very important thing if you want to legitimize it.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.560]   Because think about it.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.040]   This is the kind of thing we talk about on frame rate.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.880]   No, many years you will own this crappy sofa.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:38.880]   Great.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.880]   Only $39.95 a month.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:45.040]   But this is the kind of thing we talk about on frame rate all the time is the battle for
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.080]   living room, new media dominance.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.080]   Oh, it's huge.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.080]   Right?
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:50.080]   It's totally wide open.
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:53.520]   When you're competing in a world where there's a $70 Roku box for free.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:55.520]   But here's the thing.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.280]   If you're Joe on the street who's not really familiar either with video games or with new
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.000]   media and I try to tell you this is why.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.520]   Either by everybody should watch our shows, your shows and all these shows because you
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.360]   learn not to do stupid stuff like buy that crap.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.360]   To Shacer.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360]   That's all right.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.360]   No, that's 100% ironic.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.360]   Diablo three.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.360]   You excited?
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:16.360]   May 15th.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.360]   Yes, ish.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.360]   Diablo is, I don't know.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.360]   You played it already.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.360]   It's like we just called a monster pinata games.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.840]   It's like you just click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:23.840]   At some point that that wears down to me.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.840]   To be honest, I'm way more excited about Orcs Must Die 2, which is like a what?
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.880]   Orcs Must Die is the best tower defense game ever.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:32.880]   I love the music.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:33.880]   Oh, it's tower defense.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.040]   This is tower defense from a first person perspective.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:39.320]   You are the first shooter tower defense.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.320]   That's okay.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.320]   Stop mocking me, sir.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.320]   Dude.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.320]   Orcs Must Die.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.320]   Sure.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.320]   More ads.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.840]   Is this like comes on a disc?
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.840]   Orcs Must Die 2.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.560]   It's going to be digital distribution.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.000]   It adds co-op to it.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.400]   You run around basically the Orcs come bashing in and they try to make it to the rift.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.120]   And meanwhile, you earn money by killing Orcs.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:04.400]   You spend the money by building traps and then they die in these awesome visceral gourd
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.840]   splattering ways.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.840]   This does sound like fun.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.200]   And it's all first person perspective.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:13.680]   So it's like you could decide to spend your money on increasing your weapon powers or on
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.160]   building more traps.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.160]   And again, Orcs Must Die 2.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.160]   And this is on Steam?
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.160]   Yeah, it's on Steam.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.160]   Steam's good.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:22.160]   Steam is brilliant.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.160]   Steam is.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.720]   Now that's a billion dollar company.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720]   Oh my god.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.720]   You're kidding me.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:29.400]   There's all kinds of talk about there being some kind of hardware and developments here.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:30.560]   You can see what he's doing.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.800]   You got this river of Orcs coming in.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:33.640]   So he's still defending against Orcs.
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.640]   Or whatever.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.640]   It's all first person perspective.
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.640]   Right.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.640]   You're just good about it.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.640]   You're preparing.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.640]   I like this.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.360]   And then plus, let's like if you're better at first person shooter type stuff, you could
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.960]   rely on your own ability to cast spells to kill them all.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.000]   Here's another rumor I'm excited about.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000]   Skyrim MMO.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.840]   You know, this is an interesting thing.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.680]   And I understand from a business perspective why they would want to do that.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.320]   So this is Skyrim, which is kind of an anachronism in gaming, was a standalone game.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.520]   You don't play against other people.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.840]   You play against AIs.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.240]   You're playing against a game just you by yourself all alone.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.800]   And the number one thing people say when they play it is that it feels like an MMO,
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:08.800]   but it's all just for you.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.800]   But I like it better because it's you.
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.240]   Well, because you don't have to rely on other people.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.240]   There's no teabaggers.
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:15.240]   Right.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.840]   If you know what I mean, I'm not talking politics.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.880]   I like the fourth person shooters.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:21.880]   Really?
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.560]   I can't wait to get one of those.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.440]   It's in the future an old man talking about people he shot.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:30.120]   First person shooter in 3D.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:31.480]   As at the fourth person.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:36.520]   But here's the interesting question on Skyrim is it makes sense from a business perspective.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.520]   If you've invested this much time and effort to create a world and a set of systems.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.080]   Why not make it a public world?
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:45.000]   Why not turn it into a money factory?
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.360]   But the problem is from a positioning standpoint, you already have World of Warcraft, which
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.640]   is of course the £800 gorilla.
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:56.440]   And you have essentially a copy of the exact same gameplay mechanic with Star Wars the
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.440]   old refactor.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.120]   That's what a fourth person shooter is.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.320]   You're watching someone else play Warcraft.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.320]   That would work.
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320]   Pretty good.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.320]   I won the game last night.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320]   Sit in there.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.320]   I'm watching.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:12.040]   But the problem with Skyrim is that I actually suspect it's too close to World of Warcraft
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:13.040]   to get a big market.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.040]   That's not different enough.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.400]   Well, and plus most of the things people love most about Skyrim are not going to be in the
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.400]   MMO.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.040]   Oh, that's depressing.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:22.040]   Like dragons?
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.280]   I don't know about dragons, but certainly the gameplay mechanic.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.440]   It's not going to be what was great about Skyrim is run around with your left hand and
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:29.440]   right hand.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:32.160]   You can use a shield and a sword or two different spells or whatever.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.160]   I'm back.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.160]   None of that.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:39.120]   Hey, when you go back to Austin, yes, hopefully soon.
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.360]   Make sure you meet up with Adam Curry.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.360]   He lives there.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.360]   I didn't realize he was in Austin.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:44.360]   He's moved to Austin.
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:45.360]   He's moved to come soon.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:50.600]   You know, also, most of Austin is, you know, that guy.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.600]   You got to do the thing.
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.600]   You got to do the string through the nose.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.600]   The human craziest draw.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.480]   You have the string going through your eyeball and then in and out of both nostrils and then
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.480]   out the ear.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.480]   That's original reporting.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.480]   That's what every article.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.480]   Do you do that?
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.760]   Or did you hammer an alien ear ear?
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.560]   See, that's all I screw both of you guys.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.560]   Okay.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.120]   I want to thank you all for being here.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:15.880]   Mr. John C. Devorak is found often, at least twice a week at NoAJendorshow.com.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:16.880]   That's right.
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.760]   And then of course, there's Channel Devorak.
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:21.920]   Those other shows that you do, which there are many.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:22.920]   And there's Collins.
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:23.920]   Yeah, DHM plug.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:24.920]   They do that.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.920]   I do the Twitch.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:26.920]   That's new.
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.920]   DHM plug.
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:31.480]   DHM plug is the Devorak Horowitz stock market show with the U.K.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:32.480]   You know, he's still around.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.480]   He said you blew it.
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.160]   He told me, get into cash.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:39.160]   He told me that.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.600]   That was back when you should have been in cash.
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.880]   And I, and I, well, you're in cash now.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:43.880]   This is like a cash.
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:47.160]   Yeah, she's I'm in cash.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.160]   Channel Devorak.com.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:52.320]   And we're going to, I am because I know you all love.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.920]   And if you're, if you're listening, I apologize.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:58.600]   But just to describe this, John is wearing a Canary Yellow shirt.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.600]   It's striped white in Canary Yellow and big stripes.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.400]   I mean, Brian Wilson Beach Boys.
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:05.400]   It's like a referee shirt, but yellow.
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:07.000]   He looks like a soda jerk.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000]   Soda 1950s.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.080]   And I'm going to buy a dozen of these in every color for John.
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.080]   I'm going to find them.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.600]   I'm going to buy them and you will have them.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.600]   Ah, great.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.080]   Let me look at the label.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.880]   He can show up shirtless and you can hand him his shirt for the show.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.640]   Oh, it's Abercrombie and Fitch.
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.040]   He's an Abercrombie girl.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.040]   All right.
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.840]   Brian Brushwood is at scam school.
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.560]   That's what brought you to town this week, right?
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.560]   Yeah, we did.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.040]   We shot 13 episodes of scam.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:34.040]   I saw you teaching Veronica Belmont to eat fire.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.880]   We, I taught a bunch of the Rev 3 folks, hosts how to eat fire.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.560]   And we did, we actually had world champion magician Michael Ammar out for five episodes.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.560]   It was fantastic.
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:44.560]   It's a man.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.560]   It's really an exciting shot.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.560]   Magic shop?
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.560]   Yeah, we did.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.280]   Oh, look at the, you do read all these books.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.360]   But of course, big news is a scam school book.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.400]   We got book two coming out in June.
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.240]   So it's a success, I guess.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.480]   Scamschoolbook.com.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.720]   And on June 19th, we're going to drop, you know, we failed to hit number one in the
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:02.720]   US.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:04.200]   God, I tried so hard.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:09.440]   We hit, but you know, we lost two was that erotic BDSM 50.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.680]   Fifty shades of grade, volume three.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:15.080]   That is an awesome book.
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.080]   We beat, we, there are three of them.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:19.420]   If we had video, that would be sexy.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:23.680]   We beat the bottom of those three, but we still have book two.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:24.680]   Funny, funny.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:25.680]   That's what I mean.
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:26.680]   I nailed it.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:27.680]   That's bad.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:30.960]   And the best way to buy, it's on iBooks, Kindle and Barnes and Nobles Nook, but the
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:34.960]   best way to buy it is on the iBooks because that's got the video, the audio.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.900]   That's when everything's embedded and it looks pretty.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:41.040]   And that's also the store that seems to be the most vulnerable to a cheating attack,
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.040]   which is what we're good at.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.160]   The next attempt is going to be, yeah, get number one here.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:49.640]   Book two comes out on June 19th, scam school book.com is going to be freaking rad.
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.800]   I'll tell you, people are saying really nice things about it.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.480]   People are saying, I can't believe you could do another one so quickly.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480]   It's almost as if.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.160]   Yeah, so you should have done one big one to begin with instead of ripping off your customers.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.160]   What a scam.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.160]   You actually can't.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:04.160]   There's a there's a there's a maximum file size that you get.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.160]   Oh, as much as we go.
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:07.160]   Wow.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:11.040]   See, go to the LGAN dot com to find out what Mike Elgin is up to.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.400]   Of course, he's very prolific.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.400]   Just share your sexy circle and then people will be following me.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.440]   I'm going to share that everybody wants to know the sexy circle.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:24.880]   And also, even though I personally only use Google plus, my Google plus stream automatically
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.480]   goes to Facebook, Twitter and a bunch of other places.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.040]   So see, that's the way to do it.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.560]   And your platform agnostic.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:31.560]   That's right.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:34.000]   I'm everywhere except for I personally only use Google plus.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.640]   But you don't have to use anything else.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:36.640]   Right.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:39.480]   Because if you fall on Facebook or Twitter, how do you post Google plus over?
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:40.480]   It's a different thing.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:42.120]   I think whether it's different things were different.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:45.600]   Like I use Manage Flitter for Twitter automatically posts.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.360]   I use RSS for my email newsletter.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.880]   Goes out every day.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.160]   I don't even touch it.
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.600]   Sometimes I don't even read it.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:55.200]   This is really clever because basically, yeah, he's got this.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.200]   He's plugged in.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:00.040]   You're just writing writing on Google plus and it's automatically feeding all these sources.
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.040]   That's right.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.040]   It's very.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:03.440]   I've been wanting to get together with him over coffee.
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:08.160]   You've got to like learn his tricks because he is the king of this.
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.160]   He really is.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.160]   I agree.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.160]   Okay.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:15.120]   What you're telling me is all you do is write posts for Google plus and you have a series
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.240]   of systems that automatically aggregate and publish on different platforms.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.160]   I will get with you and steal all your time.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:22.160]   Well, everybody wants it.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.160]   You could write a book.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.160]   You should go.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.160]   I am buying.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.160]   I am buying.
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.360]   When I go, for instance, I have to say the negative of this is when you go and follow
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.160]   them on Twitter, what you see is kind of less than.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.160]   It's perfectly formatted for Twitter.
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.480]   Less than native.
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:40.760]   But the link takes you and Tim O'Reilly talked about doing this as well.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.520]   The link takes you back to Google plus where you can have a real conversation.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.680]   You can have a conversation on Twitter.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:45.680]   Give me a break.
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.680]   No, that's not true.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:47.680]   You could have conversation.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:48.680]   I agree with you.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.680]   I don't know.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680]   It's hard to follow.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:53.680]   Conversations on Google plus are so good.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:57.600]   It's hard to follow without threaded discussion.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:59.160]   It's very hard to follow.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.160]   It's not that bad.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.080]   I block all the trolls and idiots.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:03.080]   Everybody who's who.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.480]   See, I listen to trolls.
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.960]   It's one of those things that's no matter how hideous what they have to say is, there's
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.480]   a chance that somewhere in there will be an insight that will be valuable.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.480]   It's like I try to roll with anyone.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:16.640]   I'm not asking everyone's going to troll me on Twitter now.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.640]   They should.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.640]   I just blocked it.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.640]   I just asked for it.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:24.120]   Hey, you know, this is going to be, it was kind of a slow news week, but next week I think
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:25.120]   is going to be the greatest.
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:26.120]   Let's find out, shall we?
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.120]   Tom Meredith.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.120]   Oh, it's Tom here?
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:29.120]   What was we doing?
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.120]   Alright, Tom.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.120]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:32.120]   Good to have you.

[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:10.960]   Becky Worley for filling in last week.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:11.960]   You were here with me."
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:12.960]   She did a great job.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.960]   She did a good job.
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:14.960]   Yeah, it was wonderful.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:17.760]   Yeah, I was in North A. And then the week before, did Tom do it the week before?
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:18.760]   No, you were here.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:19.760]   You were here.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.760]   You were here.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:21.760]   You were here.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.760]   You were here.

[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:28.760]   I have a body confusion problem.
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.760]   I thought I was Tom, but I wasn't.
