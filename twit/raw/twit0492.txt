[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300]   John C. Devorek and I stayed home.

[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.300]   Good to be here.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.300]   Testing out some new camera stuff.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.300]   Yeah, you got to switch or what you get?
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   I don't know what this is.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.300]   Whoa.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.300]   It's just something.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.300]   This is a show you're going to want to watch the video for.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.300]   Also here he was in Vegas.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   Mr. Father Robert Wallister.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.300]   They don't say Mr. Father.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.300]   As sometimes they do.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.300]   Father Robert Ballister.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.300]   The digital Jesuit and a host of this week in Enterprise Tech, coding 101, know how on
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.300]   the Twit network and our reporter in Vegas for CES.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.300]   I actually got, this is a, I was indoors the whole time so I got a TV tan.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.300]   This is just for the screens.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.300]   That is wild, a central hall.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300]   That is wild.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   And I'm also pleased to welcome another original Twitter.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   That's not right is it?
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300]   Member of the Twit team, Patrick Norton.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   Used to be Texilla.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   It's now Tech Thing and it debuts this week at Tech Thing.com.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   Yes, we launched our first episode.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   We have a, we'll go to Tech Thing.com is live, youtube.com/c/techthing.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.300]   And if you're in a supportive mood, patreon.com/techthing, T-E-K-T-H-I-N-G.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   And before John asks, it was thousands of dollars to buy T-E-C-H thing.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.300]   But Tech Thing, T-E-K-T-H-I-N-G was nine dollars.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.300]   So guess which I rolled.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.300]   But it's also a call back to Techzilla.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   Yes.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.300]   I tell you spell "Techzilla."
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.300]   Yes it is.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.300]   So Techzilla is like all the other shows now on revision three in hiatus forever.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.300]   Well, the internally produced ones.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.300]   They still do their external partnerships.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.300]   They've got some new stuff I understand that's going to be launching January, February this year.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.300]   But Discovery didn't want to do internals.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.300]   They want to have a studio anymore.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.300]   Basically.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.300]   It's my understanding.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.300]   So what did they want me?
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   What did they say?
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.300]   They said goodbye?
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   It's okay.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.300]   Look, I got seven and a half years out of that.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.300]   Seven and a half years would not have happened if Discovery had not purchased revision three.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.300]   Right.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   I have no qualms.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.300]   It was an amazing experience.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.300]   I have to do some cool stuff.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.300]   I have to do some crazy stuff with Subaru.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.300]   It was good.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.300]   It was an amazing experience.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.300]   And you're going to just leap from Lily Pad to Lily Pad.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.300]   Now you're going to do Tech Thing.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.300]   Well, it's like the roll-in.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.300]   It's like the roll-in.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   It's four point O or DLTV three point O or Techzilla two point O or Tech Thing one point O.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   And yes, that's not going to get to own it.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.260]   So all the any decisions, like any stupid decisions were either me or Shannon or Shannon.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.260]   And I work in the air.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.260]   You own them.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260]   I get to own all of the decision.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.260]   But before we do that, before we get into the main part of it.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.260]   I know you've been holding off very well.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.260]   Go ahead.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.260]   That's that feel.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.260]   It feels good.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.260]   It feels really good.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.260]   That's a year of good luck.
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.260]   Well, I came back from CES and my son's head was like a number two with like a little bit
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260]   of a little boy cut, which is really strange because his hair is usually super long.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260]   Like he looks like a mop it or a mop it actually looks like a mop.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.260]   He does have long hair.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.260]   So now his hair is like is not quite as short as yours.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.260]   But this is the first time you've ever had less hair than I've had certainly for the
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.260]   last five, six, seven years.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.460]   So you ever shaved your head?
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.260]   My head was shaved for me by a group of football players in high school.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.260]   Oh, Lord.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.260]   And then I grew my hair halfway down my back in college and then cut it short again.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.260]   Yeah, I was.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.540]   No, there's nothing more fun than having long hair in a ponytail in a cowboy hat in CBGB's
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.580]   throwing down with skinheads on a Saturday night because that, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.580]   is my idea of a really good unit.
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.580]   I have really boring evenings.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.580]   I know.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.580]   Patrick's got a boy.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.580]   So it's the man who's sneaking secure hardware on behalf of the Vatican out of small country
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.580]   that's the other thing.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.580]   That's the other thing.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.580]   That's the other thing.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.580]   Okay.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.580]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.740]   So I share for those and everybody knows, but if you're just tuning in and you missed our
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.380]   New Year's Eve marathon 24 hours and you're all invited for next year, I know you were
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.420]   there Robert.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.500]   We raised $75,000 for UNICEF and on the way to $75,000, I pledged to shave my head for
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.140]   $40,000.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.420]   Did that promise to get a tattoo for $50,000?
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.060]   Did you get the tattoo?
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.060]   Yes, I did.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.980]   Ask him where it is, John.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.980]   It's on his butt probably.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.980]   You know that.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.580]   So you guys know me well, I'm going to wear this hat though for the rest of the show.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.580]   No, don't wear that.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.580]   I'm throwback into the 70s.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.980]   Actually, I think I might be cleaning up a little later on.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.980]   You guys call me Madge.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.660]   You cleaned up on the New Year's event.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.660]   75 grand for UNICEF.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.660]   It's great.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.540]   In fact, they said we're building a hospital in Guano Mala thanks to you.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.580]   Would you like to come down and visit it?
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.580]   So that's pretty good.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.580]   I feel good.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580]   And it's really thanks to you all.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.580]   So thanks for your donation.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.580]   Well, thank you.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.580]   It's not too late.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.580]   I don't let me just check.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.580]   UNICEFUSA.org/twit.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.580]   Wow.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.060]   It's still going up.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.220]   63 in cash.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.540]   The rest of it was through our auctions.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.820]   So you can still donate.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.460]   So I guess we'll keep that up a little bit.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.220]   When we ended, we were like 58, 900.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.980]   Dr. Mom put us over 60 so that Paul Therat would shave his head at 60.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.460]   Anyway, it was a lot of fun.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.340]   We're going to do it again, I'm sure.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.260]   But thank you for everybody for your donation.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.260]   So CES.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.260]   Why?
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.180]   Now, John, you haven't been to CES in how many years?
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.460]   I went last year.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.460]   You did go last year.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.860]   So you go every few years.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.340]   Is that your plan?
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.740]   You know, it's like, first I got to decide whether there's anything worth going to see.
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.340]   And then I have to decide whether I want to go through the agony.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.660]   By the way, and I have all the tricks.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.780]   I know where I can park a car right by CES.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.020]   I know I know every way of getting around there.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.340]   And I always rent a car.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.100]   But it's just the crowds.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.420]   And this CES had to be a nightmare for everyone who's going to catch up the flu from the CES.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.420]   I know what he did.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.700]   I don't know how Robert survived without getting sick.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.300]   But there's 160,000 people.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.340]   And if one person goes sick, everybody's going to get it or at least have a good shot at
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.340]   getting it.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.340]   I live at a high school.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.860]   So chances are I already got it.
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.860]   I see.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.860]   You're better now.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.460]   I don't say, you know, it's just and it's also over covered.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.020]   I mean, I don't really have a reason to go to it.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.900]   There's there's 3,300 booths and 10,000 10,000 reporters.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.140]   There's three for every booth and they don't cover all the booths, which just makes no
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.100]   sense to me, but they don't.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.100]   And it's just over covered.
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.100]   And I don't.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.420]   And there's nothing really comes out of it.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.900]   And everyone always bitches about this at the end of the day.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.420]   I mean, I'm sure Patrick got some good stuff off the wall.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.420]   Well, that's what I'm wondering.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.020]   I mean, you say I have to check to see if there's anything we're any reason to go.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.340]   But isn't it the thing you don't expect that's going to be the most interesting thing that
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.340]   comes out of CES?
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.340]   Absolutely.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.020]   Well, it's also it's a chance like, you know, Robert Heron, Heronfellow.com, my partner
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.180]   in crime from A.T.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.180]   Nation.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.220]   You know, he goes there to physically get hands on with all of the new TVs, right?
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.740]   Because these TVs aren't going to ship for six months, but he goes in and he gets up close
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.220]   and personal with with the latest.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.220]   And that makes sense.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.220]   You have to see it in person.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.860]   You can't see it on the Internet that we do the same thing with Scott Wilkins and our
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.860]   home theater guy.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.620]   And he did it actually if you haven't seen the home theater geeks from this week, he
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.020]   did the tour of all the big booths, the Sony, the Sharp, the LG, the Chinese.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.340]   Another good reason not to go because he goes and he knows a lot more about it from
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.340]   the big.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.340]   He knows what he's seeing.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.940]   I would agree with you most years.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.500]   Like the last five years of CES have been useless.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.620]   We could have not gone and gotten everything just by reading the reports.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.660]   This year was different.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.660]   It absolutely was different.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.660]   Why was it different?
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.820]   Well, the biggest thing is no tablets and no cases.
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.820]   It's not amazing.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.700]   The last five years have been all tablets all cases.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.700]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.100]   There weren't any there wasn't iPhone accessory heaven somewhere.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.100]   There was.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.100]   But it was the big thing.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   Who cares?
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.100]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.100]   I mean, it was I think Samsung.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.460]   They talked about maybe one tablet, the Internet of Things which I have officially defined as
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.300]   a hot mess, right?
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.420]   Because it's a hot, hopefully interoperable mess, which a couple years ago it was a hot
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.860]   but closed down and difficult to deal with.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.500]   It's still meth mess.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.540]   It's still a pain, but it's going to be really interesting to watch that evolve.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.540]   The Internet of Things is everywhere and it's defined in 10,000 different ways.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.260]   It was interesting to see how CEA is kind of moving the industry forward.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.540]   They pulled the 3D Printings Association which puts on CES.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.660]   Even though it's this Consumer Electronics Association, CES is not the Consumer Electronics
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.660]   Show.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.660]   Well, yes.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.660]   But we should probably it's international CES.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.660]   So what did CEA do?
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.660]   Okay.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.660]   There's a bunch of interesting things going on, right?
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.100]   Microsoft drops out.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.300]   Intel drops out from the big press day events, right?
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.100]   Intel still has a booth though, don't they?
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.540]   Microsoft doesn't have it booth in years.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.540]   Apple hasn't gone in years.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.540]   But Apple, yeah.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.340]   I mean, you know, Apple, whether Apple leaked the rumors or the rumors just happened to
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.340]   show up during CES.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.340]   Yeah, let's do.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.140]   Apple doesn't deal with CES, but they drop a few things just to keep people nervous,
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.140]   right?
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.100]   But what was BMW had half of the parking lot in front of the LVCC.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.300]   And you might be thinking like, who cares?
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.860]   They brought like 50 BMW i3s.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.420]   They were doing electric vehicles.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.580]   They were showing reporters advanced version of autonomous driving technology, you know,
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.780]   with a like an Android Wear watch or an Android smartwatch, you know, where they were like,
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.820]   you know, car or BMW i3, hear boy or whatever they were saying and do it.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.380]   And then the car would drive up to them and they would get in, the car would drive itself.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.660]   You would send the car to park itself.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.660]   That's a pretty neat demo.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.100]   But when you look at like the press days, you know, GM was announcing for 30 seconds,
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.980]   they previewed the new Chevy Volt tonight before while they were talking about on-star Volkswagen
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.340]   had a major keynote, Toyota had a major keynote.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.460]   You know, the LG was partnering with Audi.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.220]   So the automotive manufacturers have come in in a very, very big way that I certainly
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.580]   would not have expected two, three years ago.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.740]   And it wasn't, oh, yeah, Ford announced saying three.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.380]   There's a lot of the in dashboard stuff, but automotive manufacturers are talking about
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.660]   the stuff in the rest of the car at the consumer electronics show.
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.660]   That was one of the big things.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.740]   I'm surprised the cars were there because, well, in years past the Detroit Auto Show has
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.420]   been at the same time, this time they moved it.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.420]   It starts tomorrow.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   That's what was so funny.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.420]   Gee, that's why they moved it.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.340]   And in the middle of in the middle of GM's kind of like on-star 4G LTE, room booking and
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.900]   hey, and they whip some curtain backs for 30 seconds.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.460]   And here's the next generation Chevy Volt in 30 seconds later, the curtain goes shut.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.100]   And it's like, we'll tell you the rest about everything.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.180]   It's all up with the new Volt, that Detroit, right?
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.180]   So obviously, I mean, I'll make it.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.180]   It does show their savvy.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.100]   The cars are more consumer electronics than they've ever been in the past.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.380]   Ford really was one of the first to go to these events because of sync and they wanted
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.620]   to get a reputation as a technology company.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.540]   What about autonomous vehicles?
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.540]   Did you see any of those?
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.220]   The big autonomous vehicle pavilion was outside.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.740]   So you had Audi, you had Mercedes, you had BMW and you had VW.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.300]   Were they all concept cars?
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.300]   No.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.300]   That's the fantastic BMW.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.020]   You can actually buy that car in Europe.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.020]   Wow.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.580]   I saw the Mercedes Benz concept car, which was like a living room on wheels.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.580]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.140]   Well, this is, I mean, this is, I got to talk to, you know, one of those large electronics
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.420]   manufacturers you've never heard of except for you heard of once that actually provides
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.140]   like half the parts where half the automobile manufacturers in the world.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.980]   I was talking to one of these people at SEMA in 2013 and one of the things I was told
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.540]   was like, yeah, you know, luxury autonomous vehicles, 2017, they're going to be all over
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.540]   the place.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.500]   Affordable autonomous vehicles 2025 assisted driving like is going to show up in the eye.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.660]   It's amazing how fast this stuff is coming.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.660]   Right.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.980]   So, you know, autonomous or assisted driving, I.E. like the car is going to try to keep you
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.660]   from swerving in front of the 18 wheeler.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.700]   That's going to be like 2017, 2018 by 2025.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.300]   You know, autonomous self driving cars should be fairly common.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.340]   I and cars already have a lot.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.340]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.980]   But there's a difference between your Audi A8 and like me buying a two year old beat
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.980]   to snot Subaru.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.900]   When it's in the two year old beat to snot Subaru that I'm going to pay for, it doesn't
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.900]   cost that much.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.140]   Like the Audi system was ridiculously impressive.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.380]   I love what they did with the A7 and the RS7.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.900]   Those were beautiful cars.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.540]   But the one that got it for me was the VW because the sensors they used to make it assisting
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.820]   and self parking are actually already in the eGolf.
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.140]   If you buy the eGolf package, those sensors are there.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.980]   They just wrote software to use that in a different way.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.420]   Yeah, well, even Ford has said we have many sensors in our cars now.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.420]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.620]   And the idea is they're going to be there and we'll be able to take advantage of them in
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.580]   years to come even if we don't today.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.380]   But there's also consumer acceptance.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.380]   Right.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.740]   I think the idea of that Mercedes Benz car where you have a swivel seat so you don't
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.420]   have to see out the window is a little scary.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.580]   The idea of saying, well, let's just have a cup of tea and we'll let the car get us
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.580]   there.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.580]   Will people accept that?
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.580]   I guess they will.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.580]   I mean, we do it.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.340]   You want it now already in airplanes?
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.340]   Airplanes fly themselves.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.740]   I mean, I often landing themselves.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.460]   You drive in Northern California.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.180]   Like I started driving in Jersey and I thought the worst thing I could ever see I saw on
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.980]   the night I got my learner's permit, which was driving to the Newark airport from like
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.820]   semi rural Pennsylvania on a Friday night to pick up my cousins.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.220]   It was one of the great nightmares of Route 22.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.220]   Right.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.020]   And then I moved to Northern California and I find out what really stupid driving looks
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.020]   like.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.020]   Right.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.540]   And that's not even thinking about like what are the last four things you've seen people
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.780]   doing in the car that was doing?
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.780]   It's true.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.060]   People are reading a newspaper, terrible drivers, applying makeup, eating meals, shaving.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.620]   I think everybody accepts the idea that a self driving car would do a better job 90%
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.220]   of the time, but it's the fear that it'll get in a situation where it can't handle it
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.660]   and it'll just fail.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.740]   But Audi has something for that 10%.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:32.700]   So their system uses it has near-field sensors for, you know, pedestrian avoidance, but it
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:38.020]   also can see was it three miles down the road with LIDAR, with laser radar and some other
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.740]   system and it actually has a software.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.740]   Right.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.060]   It will tell you if the road doesn't look like it thinks it's supposed to look, if it's
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.180]   not matching up to the GPS, it will actually inform the driver, you're going to have to
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.700]   take control of me and wake up to the mercy of the house steering wheel.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.700]   It was just hidden away.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.700]   It's a concept.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   Who knows?
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.100]   It didn't look like there were any controls.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.980]   Mercedes had a big black booth with the shiny car in the middle of it and I'm pretty sure
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.580]   nobody was allowed to get within touch.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.660]   They shut down the Las Vegas Boulevard northbound.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.660]   Right.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.320]   To have the Mercedes entourage and we have video because we were stuck in this traffic
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320]   jam.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.020]   People were coming close to the car and you had these big, suited German, do not touch
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.020]   the car.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.620]   I didn't outy drive its autonomous vehicle two of the show.
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.620]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.620]   500 miles.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:28.060]   So John C. Devorak from the Gitmo Nation, how long is it before the police put in a
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.860]   kill switch in a car that says not merely stop driving because they already have that, you
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.300]   know, the lenders have that.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.620]   But come to the police station right now.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.780]   Are you worried about that, John?
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.460]   I don't see why they don't implement that as soon as possible.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:47.380]   I mean, these self-driving cars are going to be easy to probably, you know, stop or make
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.620]   them drive someplace they don't want to go.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.620]   I would imagine.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.260]   The Silicon Valley show, I think there's a self-driving car that puts a guy in a container
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.460]   and chips him out to the middle of the Pacific.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.460]   Exactly.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.700]   I mean, my destination has been reprogrammed.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.980]   Well, I mean, it also, but it's kind of like the underlying thing all the hackers have
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.420]   been giggling about with the Internet of Things is like, oh, so, you know, you're going
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.620]   to take an object.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.820]   You're going to probably, it's probably going to have, you know, an inexpensive chipset,
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.180]   which has a three or four year old code base that you may or may not have time to vet internally
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.220]   before you ship the product.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.220]   You know, and they're all like, you know, the, on one hand, if you have your white hat
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.220]   on.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.220]   That's great.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.500]   And if you have your black hat on, that's great because it's either going to provide
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.700]   epic new holes into the system or it's going to, you know, have, you know, opportunities
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.940]   to secure things or, you know, and in the car, the ultimate definition of an air-gapped
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.940]   computer.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.380]   Well, that's, well, unless, you know, it all depends, right?
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.020]   You know, I mean, there was, you know, people were like, you know, well, you know, I don't
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.020]   have a key anymore.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.540]   And it's like, oh, well, I can blue snare if you're key and then I can open your car
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.540]   when you're gone, right?
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.540]   I mean, it's, it's interesting.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.260]   Hyundai did something really cool.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.820]   There are all of their blue link systems going back to the original Sonatas in 2012.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.100]   Their new application, which will remotely start the car and turn on the air or turn
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.100]   on the heat, right?
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:09.140]   Depending on whether you're in Florida in August or Oklahoma, you know, in, in, in December,
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.020]   will work with all the cars going back.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.300]   So it's obviously going to be a big deal that they securely living snot out of these,
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.940]   not just the car itself, but the network connection and the applications that are running on
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.940]   Android or iOS.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.780]   That's a big deal.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:26.100]   You know, somebody Terry Kay in the chat room says police aren't going to like self-driving
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.020]   cars because they won't be able to write tickets anymore.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.020]   You'll always be going the correct speed limit.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.180]   You'll never run a stop sign.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.580]   Everything's going to be nice and orderly.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.220]   Well, is that revenue going to come from what you're doing inside?
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.580]   Well, someone's going to jailbreak their car because they want to still let it out.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.980]   And then they can write it to her.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.140]   Or because, or because somebody's, you know, doing bond hits or because they do the override
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.300]   button or because they're fornicating in the car while it's moving.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   There will be lots of plays.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.300]   There's an app for that.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.620]   Are you saying it's going to, I mean, the whole purpose of a self-driving car is so that
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.620]   we can fool around while the cars go over.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.620]   Yeah, so you can.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.620]   That's why I'm.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.620]   So I've heard.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.620]   Is that going to be illegal?
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.260]   Well, I think we need to explicitly make that legal.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.900]   It depends if you're driving the five or the one one.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.900]   Yeah, it should be fine.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.900]   It's there should be private.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.740]   You should have a privacy button that fogs the windows up and you should be able to do
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.740]   it.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.740]   I mean, you're not driving.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.740]   You got to do something.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.740]   I'm not arguing.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.260]   I'm just saying it's something's going to happen.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:25.580]   So there'll be a new kind of auto accident, you know, in flagrante de licto accident where
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.300]   I officer, I couldn't respond.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.820]   I was busy.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.300]   All right.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.900]   We crashed anything more to say about self.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.340]   I think one thing that's important and I was told this and I mentioned it before, but
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.660]   by a self-driving autonomous vehicle advocate, I think he was working at Google.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.300]   He said one thing that people don't understand is that one of the biggest resource wastes
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.060]   in the world is that we all have a car.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.500]   In some cases, more than one self-driving autonomous vehicles can create a new sharing
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.300]   economy where you don't need to own a car.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.340]   Oh, I thought Uber was doing that.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.220]   Well, but even better, you push a button.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.460]   The car comes to you, takes you where you're going and then takes off.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.100]   He said, you could even let's say you want to go camping.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.100]   You need an RV.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.100]   Carl, take you to the RV.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.100]   You get the RV.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.140]   The car takes off the RV drives you where you want to go.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.740]   You don't need to own a car anymore.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.060]   If you saw autonomous vehicles can come to you as needed.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.420]   We actually saw that six years ago at CES.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.740]   It was Nissan and they brought they looked like segues.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.740]   They were two wheel vehicles.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.940]   But the whole idea was it's a small pod and you could summon multiple pods.
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.900]   So if it's just you, you get one pod.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.260]   If you've got cargo, you get two pods and they caravan.
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.780]   And when you're done, you send it back out into the network.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.700]   It is taxi service, but the point is there's an kind of infinite, you don't have to wait
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.700]   for it.
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.700]   Well, maybe it would.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.700]   Well, it's not a driver, I guess is the only difference.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.700]   Yeah, it's the way mass transit used to work.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.700]   Right.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.380]   This is the reason for it is so against these things.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.220]   Even though they like to talk a big game, in fact, when you it when any of these meetings,
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.580]   they have these out here on the coast quite a bit.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.380]   The Ford guys have got a guy from the University of California and a bunch of other experts
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.580]   that say they're all self driving.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.100]   Carl never work network cars is the way to go.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.100]   You want the car.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.900]   So they talk to each other, but they don't necessarily drive because people and then the
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.100]   follow up, of course, apparently they don't know any millennials.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.820]   But the follow up is people really like to drive what Alan Malali would always say when
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.820]   they ask him about autonomous vehicles like to drive, but they the new people out there,
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.460]   the kids don't need to drive that are out of four.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.700]   Most of them don't like to drive.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.020]   They're using Uber all the time.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:28.700]   A lot of them don't have nobody's using Uber people people in New York City and San Francisco.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.260]   My daughter, you know, a lot of money or you use.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.260]   Sure.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.740]   Even Adam Curry in Austin, Texas is using Uber.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.740]   Yeah, Adam Curry makes more in a month than I make any Uber.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.900]   No, no, Uber X is not that expensive.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.700]   It's probably cheaper than owning a car.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.300]   If you're in an area with Uber support, so you've basically talked about three large
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.780]   cities with large technology.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.780]   No, no, you'd be surprised.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.060]   I hate to tell you there's Uber and Petaluma.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.060]   There's Uber everywhere now.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.060]   Petaluma.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.060]   Yeah, of course.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.060]   But you know, we're like what?
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.060]   We're in our San Francisco.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.940]   There are Uber drivers in this area.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.740]   I think John's right, but I think there's also a lot of millennials that aren't buying
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.580]   cars because they have no money, not because they don't like to drive.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.300]   And there's still a lot of parts of the country, you know, where an Uber doesn't work nearly
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.740]   as well as people think it should.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.060]   And you are actually the poster child for somebody who likes to drive.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.940]   You love child poster adults.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.340]   You know, you love to drive.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.580]   But Mark Lane, the new CEO Ford, did say, I saw the quote, "We are working on autonomous
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.580]   vehicles.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.060]   We do plan to have autonomous vehicles to sell."
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.180]   So yeah, maybe this is the new Ford management.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.660]   Maybe they maybe they are.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.820]   Well, there's a difference between what they're working on in the back and what they're talking
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.660]   about at the front because John's totally right.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.100]   Well, he says it'll cost some sales.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.500]   Well, if you have a bunch of people that are reviewing cars, you're not going to tell
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.100]   all the car reviewers like, "Ah, cars will be driving themselves in two years."
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:50.340]   But he's making a deeper point, which is that this will reduce the amount of cars we
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.340]   sell.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.460]   And many people have said this, they won't sell as many cars because of this.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.900]   And Ford's response has always been, "Well, we'll find other markets, other ways to make
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.900]   money."
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.140]   But I think that you probably write John, this scares him a little bit.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.140]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.700]   They're going to have to face the face.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.780]   It's going to scare, it should scare everybody.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.700]   I think the kind of societal changes that will take place.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.860]   I've pointed this out before, which is what happens to the city coffers when you have
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.500]   a place like San Francisco that does $80 to $100 million in parking tickets?
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.340]   That income just goes away.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.340]   Well, it was funny like...
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.340]   And a good thing.
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.340]   Yeah, well, it's a good thing.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.340]   It's a good thing.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.340]   A lot of $100 million.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.380]   You know, CES went the other way as well.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.580]   So you've got the self-driving cars, which are going to have high price tags, are going
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.740]   to be performance vehicles with electronics up the wazoo.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.980]   And in the same pavilion, you had Elio Motors.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.740]   And Elio Motors was a $6,800 vehicle that you can buy.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.740]   It's actually decent.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.740]   It's a three-wheeler.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.220]   You can write in tandem, stripped down to basically just what you need to be safe.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.060]   So it has airbags, it has safety, it has knaps.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.060]   That's a smart car.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.060]   The same thing, right?
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.060]   Right.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.900]   Well, the reason it has three wheels is because it allows them to avoid a lot of the testing
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.900]   at the federal level.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.900]   Exactly.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.900]   You know.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   It's maybe the safest three-wheel out there, but a three-wheeled car can essentially be
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.860]   a 1957 Morgan or whatever.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.460]   You cannot overrule Newton's laws of physics.
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.540]   The larger mass is going to squish the smaller mass no matter what.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.900]   Well, they figured out as you can absorb, by turning the smaller mass into something that
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.540]   collapses and absorbs the impact.
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.540]   With me in it.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.540]   Well, that was interesting.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.540]   But that was interesting, right?
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.300]   Because they've created this channel energy around you.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:39.780]   They did a rec test with a smart car, which kind of violates, it's not intuitive, but
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.180]   the smart car one is hit by something, it bounces.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.180]   So it doesn't get smashed into a million pieces.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.980]   It literally jumped.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.180]   And they did the National Institute of Highway Safety and the big crassist, and they took
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180]   like a 61.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.180]   I think that's a funny story.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   Well, it depends on...
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.180]   Crazy, but it bounced too.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.180]   Well, it depends on where the...
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.180]   It depends on how far it's bouncing.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.180]   They do.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.180]   They do.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.700]   Oh, I'm in a ping pong ball.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.700]   I'm safe.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:09.220]   But they took like, I think it was like a 61 in Pala and a 2011 in Pala, and they smashed
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.620]   them together to doing one of the highway institute tests.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.260]   And the three ton car in terms of what would happen to the legs of the drive out of it.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.260]   I've got a passenger.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.260]   Absolutely.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.660]   Got its ass because you've got sheet metal in front of you that doesn't buckle, it doesn't
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.260]   break, it slides right through you.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.860]   We've got a smarter about this.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.620]   I mean, if the smart car turns into a Super Bowl and you're safely wrapped inside of the
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.620]   airbags, it's probably a lot of them.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.620]   This is a bit worse.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.860]   It goes up with foam and you're good to go.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.340]   I do think there is a very big market, and I think that these what these guys are really
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.020]   looking at is a very big market for driver assist stuff.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:47.180]   Self-parking cars, Ford's done really well with those adaptive cruise control, avoidance
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.540]   of merging into a lane where there's something else in the lane.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.540]   Things like that.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.460]   And that is only going to make us better drivers.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.460]   That's good stuff.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.460]   And that's all for Stitch.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.460]   It should do.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.460]   It should make us better drivers.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.460]   And that's all stuff's out.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.460]   It's out.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.700]   It's just as you point out, it's in the higher end cars.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.340]   Well, it's actually, you can buy a Subaru Outback with that stuff.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.340]   And that's not a higher end.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.340]   It's getting better.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.180]   I love my adaptive cruise control because basically I can close my eyes.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.300]   I don't want to hear it out.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.780]   I just put my hands back and I just say, you know, if there's a car in front of me, just
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.780]   slow down.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.460]   But I mean, we're all agreed that this is just a perceptual thing, right?
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.700]   I mean, we've got the technology to make safer cars, the cars that can drive themselves
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.380]   that are actually better than we are.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.220]   We just don't think people are going to make that jump to say, I want to relinquish
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.220]   control.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.220]   Isn't this always disruptive, John?
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.220]   I mean, that's the whole thing.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.220]   That's what we talk about is disruptive stuff.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.860]   Stuff that changes the classic disrupt.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.860]   This is beyond disruption.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.060]   These driverless cars.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.620]   Well, this is a societal, major societal change at numerous levels.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.860]   Much like the segue.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:45.860]   All right.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.660]   They're going to count me on the person that never thought that was going to go anywhere.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.660]   I was right.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.460]   Who wasn't said this is going to change how cities are designed?
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.460]   Steve Jobs and Bezos.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.700]   Steve Jobs says it was going to change the way cities are made and Bezos said it was going
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.540]   to be the most revolutionary thing ever.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.540]   The segue.
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.700]   They were sold to Billy Goodes.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.500]   And the maker said no one would ever crash one that he had made it possible.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   And that's when the president went off the cliff, right?
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.660]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.940]   You know, I am excited about autonomous vehicles.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.460]   I think it's going to be revolutionary.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.780]   I think it's interesting that there's a category that is totally new to CES and there
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.860]   is something to talk about.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.380]   Let's talk about TVs when we come back.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.260]   Or take a little bit of a break because if you picked another category where there is
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.020]   constant innovation and kind of a scramble to create a market because frankly, the TV
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.980]   sales have plummeted.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.860]   It's that and we'll talk about what was new in television.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.540]   That we should get Robert on for.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.540]   Yes.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.380]   But first, let's talk about a revolution in stamps.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.260]   Oh, you might say what mailing stuff that's as old as Ben Franklin.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.860]   No, no.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.020]   Post.com is actually one of the biggest revolutions in mailing things ever.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.300]   First of all, you don't have to go to the post office anymore.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:05.020]   You can print your own US postage from your computer and your printer on demand as needed
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.260]   24/7.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.060]   This is this you don't have to draw.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.860]   You don't need an autonomous vehicle to get to the post office.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.060]   You don't have to get up from your desk.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.660]   And then the mail carrier comes to you, picks it up.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.020]   It's so easy.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.180]   And by the way, this is not a postage meter.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.740]   It's a fraction of the cost.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.740]   No specialings.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.660]   You've got everything you need.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.900]   In fact, if you go to our stamps.com page right now, stamps.com, click the microphone
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.500]   at the top of the page on the right there and use your offer code TWIT.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.380]   We're going to get you something else you don't have that you need, which is a great
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.380]   digital scale.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.980]   TWIT is the offer code.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.220]   That digital scale means you always have exactly the right postage.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.540]   It's USB plugs right into your computer.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:50.060]   We're going to get you a 30-day trial, four weeks trial of stamps.com and up to $55 in
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.580]   free postage to use over your first few months as a stamps.com customer.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.460]   $55 free postage.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.540]   So there's really no reason not to find out how stamps.com can change your business.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.340]   If you mail stuff in business, if you even just invoices or brochures, we use it all
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.740]   the time for stuff like that, marketing kits.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.460]   But if you're even more so, if you're an Etsy seller and eBay seller, why aren't you using
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.460]   stamps.com?
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.820]   I still, everyone's around by selling an eBay with postage stamps, licked postage stamps
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.820]   on the thing.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.820]   It's crazy.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.700]   You could do it this way so much better.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.900]   You'll even get discounts you cannot get at the post office.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.060]   It'll fill out all the forms for you.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:32.180]   If it's a priority mail or some sort of confirmation mail, they'll email your recipient ahead of
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.180]   time with the code.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.100]   All of that is professional stamps.com.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.460]   Click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:43.060]   Use the offer code TWIT for a very special $110 bonus offer.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.420]   That's what I looked like with hair, by the way.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.740]   If you go to stamps.com, click the microphone in your tweet.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.740]   We'll see what I look like with hair.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.300]   Gosh, it was a nice head of hair.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.620]   Can you just digitally take that and drop it on top?
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.300]   Nice head of hair I gave up.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.300]   Wow.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.460]   Do I look like a different person a little bit?
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.460]   Yes.
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.780]   You look like a different person a lot.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.980]   It looks like Balmer.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.980]   Steve Balmer.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:03.980]   I was going to say.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.980]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.380]   I was going to say sling blade.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.380]   Balmer is probably a much nicer comparison.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.380]   Sling blade, thanks.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.380]   I was going to say telecevales.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.020]   You can, I, this is the other thing I've learned after I shaved my head, again for charity
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.700]   for good causes, growing back, I'll never do it again.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.700]   Disclaimer.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.740]   Is it, is it you can tell how old somebody is precisely by who they say you look like.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.740]   If they say you look like curly from the three stooges, they're 80.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:32.780]   If they say you look like telecevales, you know, in the 30s, 40s.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.060]   If they say, Balmer, this doesn't make sense.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.060]   This doesn't work.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.700]   Well, Balmer, okay, Balmer is a special case.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.700]   That's a geek.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.700]   That's like what the geek might say.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.100]   If you say Uncle Fester.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   50s, right?
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:50.340]   If you say, oh, you're Heisenberg from Breaking Bad, it's a young person.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:56.140]   If they say pit bull, I understand that say wrap a performer.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.500]   If they say pit bull, then look like pit bull.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.660]   You know who pit bull is.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.660]   I do.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:10.100]   Oh, you know what you actually do if they say pit bull Jason picture of pit bull, please.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.180]   Or we could just cut you off the video for timber.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.420]   Burf waggles says, you know, look like my dad.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.660]   All right.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.220]   TVs.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.660]   Did you go to the TV pavilions?
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.660]   I did.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.660]   Had to.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.660]   Did you watch the TVs?
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.660]   So fork.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:30.100]   So we've been for K. Look, I first saw 4K displays a CES eight years ago, something like that.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.700]   And I even then I said, this is where the industry should go.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.660]   This is really an exciting development.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.580]   A lot of people said, nah, you're not going to notice anything on a smaller screen.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.980]   It's only on a 70 or 80 inch screen.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.180]   You notice the difference.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.300]   Did you notice a difference even on 55 or 60 inch screens?
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.300]   I think you do.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.300]   There's not much content.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.060]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on, right?
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.460]   So the UHC Alliance is coming together with a bunch of television manufacturers that are
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:55.340]   trying to figure out how to get more 4K delivered so they can sell more 4K televisions.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.380]   4K screens are becoming less expensive.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.780]   So 4Ks are going to be in the in the 1080p and they already are in the 1080p range in terms
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.780]   of pricing.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.780]   Yeah, the price is plummeted.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.780]   Maybe even less.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.780]   Well, you usually think nobody's making it like, you know, Toshiba wasn't there.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.660]   Vizio wasn't there.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:16.940]   You know, it's kind of like LG's OLED versus Samsung, SUHD, Quantum Dot technology, which
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.300]   is essentially the quantum dot.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.300]   What's that?
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.300]   Did you see a quantum dot?
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.300]   Mini quantum dots.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.020]   Turn up Devorex bleed so that we can hear.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.020]   Many quantum dots.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.020]   So the thing about...
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.020]   Almost an infinite number of quantum dots.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.420]   I want to know about these things.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.420]   Okay.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.580]   So let me just explain what this is.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.580]   I think.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.860]   So these are still LCD TVs.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.780]   They're still LED backlit LCD TVs.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:46.260]   But there are now all white LEDs with a special quantum film between the LED and the screen
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.260]   that changes...
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.260]   What does it do?
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.260]   Okay.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.940]   So essentially the quantum dot technology gives you a more pure backlight or more specifically
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.500]   controlled backlight so that they are little pieces of whatever bits matter stuff that
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.300]   when they are hit with a specific wavelength of light emit light at a specific point.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.300]   It's BS, right?
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.380]   No, actually it's not.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.780]   It's an expanded color gamut.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.780]   It's better looking reds.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.620]   It's better looking greens.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.860]   It's physically noticeable.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.660]   I mean there's a lot of stuff going on with the OLEDs at LG.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.940]   One of the things is spectacular is the black levels because they're black.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.300]   There is no light coming out of them all because it is off.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.540]   With the Samsung SUHD and a lot of other places are using quantum dots.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.540]   Quantum dots are...
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.220]   It's a more efficient backlight, right?
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.900]   Yeah, that's part of it.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.900]   And it's a better...
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.980]   I asked a question.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:33.980]   So the question is done.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.980]   Yes.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.460]   Thank you, though, whether you're talking about Sony's X900 or Samsung's SUHD.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.380]   They amplify the white.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.060]   Is it kind of spectacular enough that you say, "I want this?"
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:50.140]   The thing Robert Herron said was that if somebody walks in and sees a 4K television
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:55.420]   that doesn't have the expanded color palette and a 1080p television that does have the
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:00.900]   expanded color palette, whether it's quantum dots or an LED or whatever it is, they're probably
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.260]   going to go for the expanded color.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.260]   It's going to look better.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.260]   It's going to look better.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.260]   Red is not a lie, but it's going to look better.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.900]   Reds especially look amazing.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.900]   Red is all...
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.900]   And this is why I always wear red on the show.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.060]   Red is traditionally very difficult for video.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.180]   It's too hot or something.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.780]   Okay, so quantum dots are real technology.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.140]   Here's something that makes me sad, though.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.500]   Plasma is all but dead.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   And I think many agreed.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.780]   Plasma was the best-looking television sets.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.940]   And I bought into OLED.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.340]   Now only LG is going to continue with OLEDs.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.820]   OLEDs are dying.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.500]   All these companies are putting all of their research and efforts into LCD.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   Why is that?
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.940]   Because it's the only thing anybody can afford to make other than LG.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:39.900]   It's cheap enough.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.420]   My understanding, right, and this...
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:46.820]   I am not the insider on this, but my understanding is the only company that's making any money
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.500]   on televisions is Samsung right now.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.340]   And their margins are like grocery chain.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.340]   Right.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.460]   So I have a Samsung OLED, but they're not going to make that anymore.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.900]   Well, they're like, "S UHD, this is the new LCD."
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.900]   And it looks pretty amazing.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.500]   Is it as good as Plasma?
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:10.020]   I would probably say the LG OLEDs and the Samsung UHD are as good as or better than Plasma.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.020]   I would say the OLEDs are.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.300]   But they're not making them anymore.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.220]   The super high-end TVs look absolutely spectacular.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.220]   They're beautiful.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.220]   They are TKPR-9000.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   They're technology-driven.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.220]   But nobody's buying them.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.220]   Right.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.220]   I mean, you look expensive.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.220]   They're too expensive.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.460]   And so someone may want that, but they're going to say, "I'm going to get 99% of the
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.100]   way there with this set that costs one half the price."
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.100]   My personal VL-A.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.100]   VL-A.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.860]   This is the same old story, though.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.860]   We've always had this one.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.740]   As expensive when it first comes out, then it gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper over
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:36.740]   time.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.460]   Is it possible that OLED can't get cheaper?
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.460]   Or I mean, why is it OLED?
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.460]   Well, it has got cheaper.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.460]   It's being dropped because everybody knows it's a big deal.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.420]   But I think, but four years ago, Sony had that 11-inch OLED television that was like
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.420]   $4,000.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.420]   And now for...
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.820]   I spent $9,000 on my 55.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:57.020]   Now LG is selling a 55 for $3,500.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.020]   And that's on Crutchfield.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.020]   So that's pretty much...
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.020]   That's list.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.540]   OLED has gotten cheaper.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.460]   It just hasn't gotten cheaper quick enough.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.460]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.460]   Everything else is here.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.460]   It does.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.460]   Okay.
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.460]   So it is...
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.980]   I guess the idea is we can make quantum.and get 90%, 95%, how close?
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.180]   I mean, it's quantum.it's not as good as OLED or plasma.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.140]   Robert Heron's going to be able to tell the difference.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.620]   Robert Heron, or Scott from...
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.620]   Scott Wilkinson.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.620]   Scott Wilkinson, yeah.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.620]   Thank you.
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.460]   He's going to be able to tell the difference.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.220]   The machines are going to be able to tell the difference.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.020]   I think for most people walking into a Best Buy or Magnolia or their local video shop,
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.020]   it's going to be really, really tough.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.020]   Because those are the...
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.020]   What's it by LCDs?
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.020]   But it's not even...
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.020]   The LCDs are brighter.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.020]   Oh, they're brighter.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.020]   Oh, they're not brighter.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.020]   But they also detune them.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.020]   They look like crap in these stores.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.020]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:48.820]   But even if you are in one of the rare stores where they properly calibrate everything,
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:55.300]   you're in a serious video file store, they're still going to look pretty freaking amazing.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.300]   I mean, all right.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.700]   Well, I mean, I'll accept this.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.900]   I mean, look, this is what you're going to be able to get.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.420]   And maybe LG will continue to make a high end OLED for people who really know the difference.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.220]   Or they're going to get the technology to scale.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.220]   And they'll make a blast.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.220]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.660]   Oh, that's also because they wanted to push the energy requirements down further faster.
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.660]   Right.
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.980]   And as the technology, the LCD technology gets better, the need for having plasma gets less
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.980]   critical.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.660]   The big story, according to Scott at CES, was a 4K standard.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.180]   I guess I'll now say UHD, because that's really what it is.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:34.300]   A UHD standard for color gamut, for frame rate, for codec.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.420]   They're going to use HEVC, which is the same as H.265.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.940]   And there's a standard's body now.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:46.340]   It looks like finally the content and the TVs will have something to aim for.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.060]   And that's good because we've been telling people, don't buy 4K until a standard is
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.540]   ratified at least, right?
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:56.700]   Well, the 4K televisions, I mean, a box is going to feed your 4K television.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:03.660]   But if your TV doesn't have the color gamut that the 4K or the UHD is capable of, then
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.660]   you're missing out something.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.140]   I don't know if it's visible or not.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.140]   I don't know.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.940]   So this UHD Alliance means now we now have an agreement on UHD.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.540]   We have Samsung Disney Netflix and a bunch of other people are going to argue and figure
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.540]   out what the...
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:17.540]   It's not a...
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.540]   It's Sony too.
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.540]   It's also Panasonic.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.540]   It's also Sharp.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.700]   It's called the creators, the movie companies, and now the TV manufacturers.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.540]   They've all agreed on the standard for UHD.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.540]   Well, they've basically just...
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.540]   They've all agreed to sit down and see you're out to the standard.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.540]   Right.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.540]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.540]   They've all agreed to come out with a standard of point.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.740]   We've all been through this before where at some point like Fox and Sony or Samsung
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:41.100]   and LG or, you know, it's still going to be...
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.300]   So these SUHDs from Samsung, are they...
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:48.220]   They're then not necessarily going to adhere to the standard because we don't know what
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.220]   the standard is.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.220]   It's just minimum requirements.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.220]   There's a lot of...
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.580]   The color aspect, the color standard's already been set, right?
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:58.020]   We've known 8.265 is going to be the spec for this for a couple of years.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.020]   The color, the expanded color gamut has been set for a couple of years.
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.020]   Like, they're not going to reinvent that for...
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.020]   So we're pretty close.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.020]   So we're pretty close.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.540]   This is going to be about establishing how the stuff is delivered more than anything
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.540]   else.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.540]   Right.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.540]   Getting Netflix to do it, right?
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.540]   Getting Netflix to do it.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.540]   Getting Netflix Disney, Fox, Warner, you know...
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.540]   All the big names.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.540]   If they're going to be a four...
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.540]   You know, they're supposed...
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.180]   You know, there's talking about a 4K Blu-ray spec coming out by the...
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:23.340]   Well, they did announce that they will make UHD Blu-rays this year, right?
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.340]   So we suddenly...
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.580]   And those are 66 to 100 gigabytes per disk.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.580]   Wow.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.580]   And...
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.860]   So that's going to be part of the deal.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:37.060]   So it sounds like you shouldn't buy it today, but this fall...
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.060]   This maybe is...
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:42.100]   The fall is going to be the beginning of the UHD transition.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.700]   I wait with Bated Breath.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:44.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:51.820]   And truthfully, the production companies and the networks, you know, creating 4K, basically
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.820]   scanning stuff on and releasing it 4K is like 90% more important to this than whether or
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:57.820]   not the...
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.820]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.260]   The television spec is going to matter a lot less than there's actually content in some
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.940]   format being delivered.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.140]   And as usual, price and availability up in the air.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.140]   We don't know how to skip it.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.140]   Right.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.140]   50,000.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.140]   We don't know what's going to cost.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.620]   Can we really run backwards?
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:16.340]   Can this so accustom to getting what they want on demand via Netflix or Amazon or Prime
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   or whatever it is?
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.580]   Are they going to go back to saying, "Oh, you know what?
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.900]   I'll wait three days to get this disk so that I can watch it in UHD."
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.900]   I'm with you.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:27.620]   I kind of have long proclaimed the death of physical media, but on the other hand, if
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:32.700]   you're going to go to UHD, now you really are in a demanding environment.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.700]   Maybe...
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.700]   You know, what...
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:35.700]   It's a special occasion.
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.500]   Netflix today says you need 25 megabits down to watch their UHD streams.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.500]   And that's not H.265, so maybe it'll be less.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.500]   But they don't...
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.980]   And they're certainly not as good as a Blue UHD Blu-rays when I look.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.980]   I don't know.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:54.180]   I might say, if somebody's this serious that they're getting a UHD TV, maybe they're going
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.420]   to get a UHD Blu-ray player as well because they want to get...
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.420]   They're saying, "I'm a videophile.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.580]   I want top quality."
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.580]   You're not going to...
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.580]   I mean, ESPN is 720p.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:07.220]   You're not going to be watching football on a UHD stream.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.260]   I'm not going to be watching football on broadcast over the area in a stadium, but that's me.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.260]   Right.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.340]   I mean, I also stream curling from Canada, so I'm a freak.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.420]   How is curling in 720p or do they've gotten a 1080p?
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:21.340]   I don't think I'm streaming 1080p curling, but it also...
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.340]   It's legitimate.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.060]   It's going to be interesting, because I think there would make...
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.060]   Nothing would make Hollywood faster...
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.060]   Faster.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.220]   Nothing would make Hollywood happier than controlling the keys to the access to their content and
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.780]   never releasing physical media.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.020]   They love streaming, right?
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:40.900]   Well, they love anything that requires you to purchase the right to watch the movie again,
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.900]   over and over.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.740]   Apparently, I might be wrong.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.900]   I think Netflix is using HEVC now.
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.620]   They're already aged up to 65.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.620]   I think so.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.540]   So if you're watching House of Cards or Marco Polo, these are UHD...
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.580]   And you have 25 megabits down.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.580]   These are UHD streams.
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.580]   And it's got to work with you.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:58.580]   It's a lot of data.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.100]   It's a lot of data.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.740]   So it's a lot of data.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.860]   I was streaming over my phone, which was fantastically fast.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.860]   Why?
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.460]   And I used five gigs in like two hours.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:09.460]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.460]   Burn through it.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.460]   Oh.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.460]   You have a 4K phone?
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.460]   Oh, no.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.940]   We had to hook up to the 4K monitor.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:15.940]   Oh, to the monitor.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.940]   All right.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.100]   So you guys, sounds like you guys were pretty impressed by the television stuff.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.100]   You're pretty.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.100]   Pretty.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.780]   The central hall is always glowy and blue and bright.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.740]   But this year actually had different technologies.
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.260]   Not just more TVs and bigger sizes.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.220]   You could actually look at them and say, "Okay, this actually is an improvement over what
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.180]   I've seen in previous years."
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.180]   That impressed me.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:41.100]   I haven't seen that CES for a better part of a decade.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.100]   So here's the...
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.140]   So Engage It Now does the best of CES.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.940]   Remember we used to do that?
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.420]   Tech TV used to do that?
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.100]   I'm so glad we don't do that anymore.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.140]   That was the nightmare.
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.020]   Best startup, a bandaid, called the Amps strip.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:43:00.860]   It's a sticker you put on your chest and it monitors your heart rate steps and other
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   vitals.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.860]   Huh.
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:03.860]   Okay.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:10.420]   This is actually something that was a kickstarter, the Dash.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:15.060]   And it promised a lot, but nobody's ever really used it.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:18.660]   They've had prototypes now for best digital health and fitness product.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:24.220]   These are Bluetooth in-ear speakers, monitors, headphones that do all of the monitoring as
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.540]   well, all the fitness tracking as well.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:37.980]   They also have a heart rate monitor, touch controls, Bluetooth, three hours battery life.
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.060]   So they said those were also the best wearables.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.060]   But you know...
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.100]   How many people here in the panel have any of these heart monitoring watches, anything
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.780]   that they're using as the show is going on?
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.060]   I have about a dozen of them in a box.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.180]   No, I wear my Moto 360 all the time.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.180]   I forgot it today.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.180]   But almost...
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.660]   I mean, this is like unheard of.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.660]   I couldn't find it.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.140]   But the Moto 360 has a heart rate monitor and step monitor.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.140]   When I use a heart monitor, it's like a traditional polar kind of...
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.940]   Polar's much, much better.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:10.940]   But I mean, I know a lot of people who live with a Fitbit are one of the wrist monitors.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:15.180]   I mean, you know, Garmin has some pretty good looking watches in terms of fitness watches
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.180]   these days or pretty.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.820]   Do you guys see the misfit stuff?
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.460]   We actually did a segment there.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:20.460]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.460]   They look like they're doing some interesting stuff.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.780]   A six month battery.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:24.780]   I like that.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.780]   That's not bad, actually.
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.540]   And they announced some new products as well.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.540]   Best automotive technology.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:34.300]   See, this is a joke because this car probably will never, ever, ever, ever be made.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:39.140]   The Mercedes F15 luxury and motion concept car.
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.820]   The car with no windows because why would you want to see...
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.620]   Of course you came.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.620]   Well, I mean, what the...
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.620]   It's been squished.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.620]   For prisoners.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:52.340]   But it's funny because it's such a radical revisioning of what a car is for most people.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.340]   This is like something...
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:55.340]   I think it was a shock out though.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.540]   It was absolutely a cop out.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.540]   They did it like this.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.820]   They made this concept car based on the F015 frame so that they could say, "Oh, this will
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.820]   happen in the future."
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.820]   In 10 years.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.820]   In 10 years.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.220]   You look at what Audi and VW did.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.740]   They actually drove cars there.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.460]   We sell these frames today.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.300]   I kind of like that approach.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:19.540]   Mercedes Benz sees this car as a lounge in which you drift from destination to destination.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.540]   Well, sure.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.540]   Yeah, this is William Gibson.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.540]   2530.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.540]   It has home theater product.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.540]   It's interesting.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.060]   Echo Star, the folks who do dish announce sling TV.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.060]   Remember, they bought sling box.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.060]   This one.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.660]   I think this is one of the biggest announcements of the show.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.660]   I agree with you.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.140]   And I think it's underplayed.
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.460]   Perhaps deserves more attention.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:40.780]   They've made a deal with ESPN, which is the most expensive, the number one pay cable
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:41.780]   channel, right?
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.780]   Right.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.780]   Everybody wants ESPN.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.980]   They've made a deal to offer you ESPN for $20 a month.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.780]   No, no, no.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.820]   Like, ESPN is a hot dozen other networks.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.500]   Well, but they've got a lot of networks you don't want plus a yes.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:58.500]   I mean, I know a lot of people love the Cartoon Network and a lot of people love ABC family
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.500]   HD.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:04.180]   What it really is a Disney deal because almost all of these are ABC Disney channels, including
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.180]   ESPN.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:12.460]   But 20 bucks a month that this is a is this a court cutters dream?
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.460]   Not yet.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.460]   What's wrong?
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.460]   It's nice.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.180]   I like the fact that they're moving here, but they're pretending like it's an all a cart
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.620]   Internet deal and it's not.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:21.620]   No, it's still a package.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:22.860]   And then you have to add on.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.740]   I mean, by the time you add on discovery and whatever else you want, you're looking at
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.140]   $40, $50 a month.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.940]   It's actually a lot closer to your actual cable.
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:30.940]   Right.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.700]   Especially if you throw in the Internet access, which you mean exactly.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.700]   It's not.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:38.500]   I mean, you're looking at like ESPN, ESPN 2, TNT, TBS, Food Network, Home Garden TV, Travel
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.500]   Channel, CNN.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.380]   I mean, there's a lot of pretty good stuff on here for 20 bucks a month.
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.900]   I'm not saying it's not good stuff.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:48.620]   I'm saying for most people, there's going to be a channel that they really want that
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:52.740]   they're not going to get a SP and they're going to end up paying either to continue cable.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.100]   So they can get that channel or they're going to pay another.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.820]   But let's say you want to get HBO.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.820]   Okay.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.780]   Now HBO says they're going to go all on cart to for maybe around the same price.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.940]   So you got that.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.900]   You're going to pay 40 bucks for your Internet.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.900]   Now we got 80 bucks.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.100]   Well, I'm going to pay for my Internet whether or not I have any of this other stuff anyway.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.100]   True.
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.820]   I'm not saying that, but I think it's going to end up close.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:11.820]   Bear.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.620]   In fact, I think it's no accident that it's going to end up very close to the cable bill
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.980]   you're already paying the problem.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:21.300]   You know, the other thing is let's not kid ourselves about what all a card actually means.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.940]   All a card is not a subscription.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.980]   When you go to a restaurant, you don't buy some steak, free, then you have to eat it for
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.660]   the next year, day after day.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.580]   All a card is the way it used to be or I think there's still some elements of that in the
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:38.420]   old big giant sea band dishes because nobody cared about them.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.740]   Well, you could buy a movie on HBO.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.580]   You could buy one day of HBO.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.660]   You could buy one day of show time.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.580]   You could buy every and you would just take that one day and that's what you get built
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.580]   for one day.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.780]   It'd pay 50 cents a dollar, whatever it would be.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.500]   You want to watch ESPN when you want to watch a football game or something, you pay for
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.500]   that.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.500]   That's all a card.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.180]   Well, no one's going to offer that.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.180]   Why not?
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.420]   Well, I mean, that's also what we're doing.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.860]   Because they can't scam your money.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:04.860]   That's why.
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.020]   They don't get enough money out of you.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.340]   Well, this is a big step.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:15.220]   I mean, certainly, you know, ESPN, Disney channels, CNN, TNT, TBS, that's a big chunk of
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.860]   why a lot of people, especially ESPN is why a lot of people have people.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:25.780]   And the problem is that if you want ESPN and you want HBO and you want locals because
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.980]   you want to watch, you know, you might have ESPN, but you're not going to see the Super
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.980]   Bowl.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:31.980]   You're not going to see the playoffs in ESPN.
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:35.940]   So you need the locals as well, which are the time out for your local team anyway.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.900]   Well, not for the playoffs, but the time you get a antenna.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.020]   Well, John, you want the locals get an antenna.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.020]   I got that.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.940]   Like many people, we don't live near enough to a metro to get the locals.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.540]   At a luma, we don't, an antenna wouldn't do you any good.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.540]   You sure?
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:51.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.540]   We get channel 50.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.540]   It's not a good channel.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.740]   I'm not kidding.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.740]   That's it.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:48:59.740]   It's Delamundo.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.500]   We get one, we get channel 50 and we get the local PBS station from Rotter Park.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.500]   That's it.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.260]   No seven, no four, no three, no two.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.900]   But that's the advantage of living out there in the middle of nowhere.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.660]   But they were not in the middle of nowhere.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.180]   This is not the middle of nowhere.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:14.180]   And that's the point.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.060]   A lot of people who for whom an antenna, I agree.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.940]   If you can get it, believe me, if you can get locals via an antenna, it's the best HD
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:22.940]   experience you're going to get.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.100]   It's free.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.580]   So get it.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:28.460]   Best connected home product again and gadgets, best of C.S.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.300]   The Energists, what up?
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:33.300]   Did you see this?
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.300]   Do you know what it does?
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.620]   It's wireless power distribution from Rotter.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.620]   No, 15.
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:38.620]   No.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:43.420]   It'll charge wearables, phones and sensors from that thing.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.420]   How is that?
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:46.220]   I don't know.
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.220]   It's they say it's close.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.220]   Yeah, magic.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.220]   I have induction.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.220]   Induction.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:55.060]   They can't send enough power through the air to charge my phone.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.780]   And if they could, it's going to cause cancer too.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.780]   Well, that's the bonus.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.300]   One would assume that.
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.780]   Don't get close to my what up.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.220]   Wire free power.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:10.820]   Any battery operated device that requires less than 10 watts.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.820]   Works like Wi-Fi.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:15.620]   Radio frequency system, similar to a Wi-Fi assistant delivers.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.620]   Safe, wire free.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.620]   And I'm reading from the Energists website.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:23.980]   Safe, wire free charging energy at a distance of up to 5 meters, 15 feet, from a transmitter
