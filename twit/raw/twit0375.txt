[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   Louisville.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   Louisville.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   Nice to have you back, Jason.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   And a guy we get to talk to not nearly enough because normally he's on British Standard Time,
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   Corey Doctorow of craphound.com, great author, science fiction author, just a cool guy and
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.840]   you know, an advocate for all the things that are right and good with this world and enemy
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.200]   of all of this bad.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   Corey's in the US this week touring around your new book.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   Yep.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   Pirate Cinema.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.560]   I'm in my hotel room in New York where the ethernet cable only reaches to the bed which
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.760]   is why I'm sitting in bed.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.040]   Oh, but it's a beautiful view.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.200]   It looks like you've got Central Park and wet behind you.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   No, it's just a crappy motel room picture.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   No, it looks don't tell us that.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   You ruined it.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   What is pirate cinema?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   Is it now?
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.320]   You've written both young adult novels and adult novels and lots of nonfiction.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.520]   You know, it was one of the happiest days of my life when my daughter who was in high
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.800]   school at the time gave me your book on content.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.880]   She didn't know that I knew you and I thought, I have high hopes for Abby.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   That's great.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.480]   That was your Christmas present.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   Little Brothers of Young Adult Novel.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.760]   An adult novel come out about a month ago that I wrote with Charles Strauss called Rapture
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   of the Nerds.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.000]   But this is a young adult novel and it's about kids in the UK who live in a regime where
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.400]   if you are accused of infringing copyright three times, they take away your internet access
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.360]   and this destroys their families when it happens.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.840]   That could never happen.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.840]   What do you talk about?
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.840]   Seriously.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.040]   Given that AT&T leaked plans to do basically that today, it's coming.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.600]   And so after destroying their families' lives, they run away and shame to London and they
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.040]   form a kind of semi-joke anarchist, freakin' filmmaker youth gang and devote themselves
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.640]   to destroying the entertainment industry using the only weapon they've ever really mastered,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.640]   which is piracy.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.360]   So they make their own movies and they show them in cemeteries and in old sewers they break
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.000]   into and turn into movie theaters.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.480]   But they also pirate in a way calculated to cost as much money as possible to the entertainment
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   industry and, you know, hilarity ensues.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.360]   Do you hope that this will actually inspire a whole group of teenagers to do exactly this?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.920]   No, you know what I hope it'll do is that I hope it'll inspire a group of teenagers
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.960]   and maybe adults to understand and to demand that the internet be regulated as more than
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.080]   a cable TV system.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.920]   They start thinking about the internet as, you know, the lifeline to free speech, free
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.240]   press, freedom of assembly, access to health and employment and all the rest of it and
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.800]   just like reject the idea that, you know, it's somehow proportionate that if you're accused
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.720]   of watching TV the wrong way we take away all of that.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   Here, here.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   Here, here is right.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   Thank you.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.880]   So it's always great to have Coriall.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.520]   We're going to actually interrupt briefly because we've got a phone call to make to
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.080]   Roswell, New Mexico.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.040]   So I don't know if you, did you guys watch this morning when Felix Baum got her jumped
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   out of a weather balloon and set a new record for the highest free fall, 24 miles high.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.640]   We tried to get Felix, but he was napping.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.360]   He's, he was drained.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.400]   He was drained after his adventure.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.200]   No, Felix is of course long gone, but in doing, I'm sure interviews with larger networks,
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.360]   but we were able to talk to Scott Gillies, who actually is, is from a technical point
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.920]   of view, maybe as interesting.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.840]   He's the guy who brought us those amazing pictures, 8 million people watched live on
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.240]   YouTube setting easily a new record for a number of concurrent views.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.560]   The previous record was set during the Olympics in London of half a million.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   So so that's a big jump.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.240]   It would have been bigger in London, but so many of them were being detained at the time.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.680]   Let's let's go to New Mexico and say hello to Scott Gillies.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.640]   We recorded this earlier.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.840]   This is Leo LaPort Scott, the host of the show.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.480]   Is Felix there or is he not available?
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.320]   He is long gone.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.000]   He's long gone.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   He's taking a nap.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.400]   He's taking a nap.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.840]   Well, I don't know what he's gone from the side.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.320]   He's probably not napping yet.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.360]   He's had a really exciting day.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.800]   I think so.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.160]   Maybe his heart's still pounding.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.880]   It would mind, mind is.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.600]   So Scott, what was your, what was your, what did you do?
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.680]   What did you do there?
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.560]   Well, I did a, basically a technical production oversight.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.480]   So you know, it was amazing.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.160]   We were watching the video.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.440]   And by the way, I don't know if you know, but a YouTube record, eight million people
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.960]   were watching the video.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   Kind of a.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   Yeah, we're.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yeah, well, we always, you know, bringing to be this big, but what is it really sure
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.440]   what the, you know, the exact impact would be.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.040]   And I think a lot of people were interested in Felix's story and his goal.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.120]   And it was amazing footage.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.360]   We had a fantastic team of people working for us with us.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.200]   And I think we really, it exceeded our wildest dreams, to be honest with you.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.840]   The quality of the video from the capsule was remarkable.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   How was that?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   How was that?
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   How did that work?
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.960]   Well, we basically built a flying studio.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:33.320]   We had a great partner or flight line films who helped design and ladle communications
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:40.920]   who basically worked over the last four years to develop the system to transmit all these
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.520]   pictures back down in real time.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.800]   And it was stunning as you all saw.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   No kidding.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.680]   Yeah, it's 24 miles up.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.400]   It was a high def picture.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.560]   It was crystal, crystal clear.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.840]   What kind of cameras were there in the capsule?
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:15.280]   We had a big range cameras from Lux HD cameras, which is a third-inch chip CCD camera.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.680]   We had red cameras.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.120]   So you were shooting 5K up there, too.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.120]   It was 4K.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.120]   4K.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.160]   It wasn't the epics.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.520]   And we had, of course, Canon still cameras as well.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.480]   And how were you controlling those?
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:45.440]   As a custom control software that was developed, I read a long flight line to control all
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.120]   the cameras and switch all of them live remotely via radio.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.760]   Wow.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.680]   Was there a microwave link back down?
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.320]   I mean, how was he able to get that?
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.320]   Several microwave links.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   Okay.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.320]   So it was pretty amazing.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:13.000]   But nothing, I would say, that the company's done in a long time.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.960]   Outside of NASA, this is a pretty bold endeavor.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.440]   And we're really proud to have pulled this off and work with such great partners.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.240]   No kidding.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.800]   It looks like a GoPro camera out in front of him.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   Is that accurate?
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   Yes.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   So we had on his actual body, we had GoPro cameras on his body.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.040]   So there's a lot of footage that you've recovered since.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.040]   What happens to the capsule, by the way?
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.040]   Is that still up there?
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.320]   Yeah, capsule came down safely.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.440]   And it drops my pain.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.440]   So we've recovered that.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.240]   We've recovered all the footage from Felix and from the capsule.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:07.160]   And now we're just basically trying to go through all the terabytes of footage and still
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.320]   images that we have.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.840]   So there's a lot more to come.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:17.480]   And of course, the documentary on BBC to be aired in the next few weeks.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.920]   And we're just really excited.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.280]   It's, I can't tell you the feeling.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.480]   It's like nothing else has ever worked on.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.920]   It's a truly great experience.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.840]   You know, I've worked on a lot of sporting events and news events.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.520]   But it really exceeds those expectations.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.000]   Sounds unbelievable.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.760]   What was the feeling on the ground?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:46.320]   You're watching as we are when he kind of leans forward and just falls out.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.080]   What did it feel like?
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.520]   It speaks for itself really.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:56.440]   I mean, you know, from my perspective, it's the one of the world's judges who wanted Felix
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.800]   to be happy with all the images.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.640]   And personally, it was very exciting and unbelievable.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   And not heart-wrenching.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   No kidding.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   No kidding.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.160]   Just kind of amazing.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:20.760]   Felix Baum got there 128,000 feet, 24 miles high, the largest, longest free fall in history.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   He did.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.920]   I guess we heard in the press conference break the sound barrier.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.600]   Yeah, that's still to be verified officially.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.360]   But yeah, that's preliminary data.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.520]   Unbelievable.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.520]   So now what do you do, Scott?
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.480]   You got an editing job, I guess.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   Editing and packing and shipping.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.880]   Anything out of here.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.240]   I appreciate it.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.080]   Where are you exactly?
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.160]   Is it in the desert?
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.720]   Where are you exactly?
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.680]   Roswell, New Mexico.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.880]   So that's kind of a desert area.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.880]   Yes.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   Area 51.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.680]   I don't know if Area 51 was here.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.320]   Roswell's famous for its--
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.200]   It's a lot of the new we've learned to really love Roswell and the people.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   That's great.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   It's very supportive and accommodating to us.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   That's great.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   It's part of a nice place.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.840]   Everyone should probably visit Roswell.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.280]   Scott, I cannot thank you enough for taking time.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.000]   I'm sure you have many, many things to do and I won't keep you any longer.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.320]   But congratulations on the success of the jump.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:29.680]   Congratulations to Felix and on setting a new YouTube record by a factor of 16, the
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.960]   8 million live simultaneous views.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.840]   I don't think anybody knew that that was even doable.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.360]   It's truly amazing.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.360]   It was.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.800]   And I just want to say really, there's a huge team here at Red Bull that's so many people
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.360]   that it's hard to mention everyone.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.840]   It's unbelievable.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:58.320]   Starting with Felix down, the team at CHISH, I really envisioned this whole project.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:06.120]   And for Red Bull and its owner who went through many years of perseverance and full of office.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.520]   It's quite incredible.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.040]   So I don't want to take any personal and current it for it.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.880]   It's fantastic and we're really happy everyone enjoyed it.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.920]   Thank you so much.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.320]   That's Scott Gillies in charge of the technical production for what was quite something to
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.320]   see.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.800]   You know, what's interesting to me, and I don't know if you guys want to comment on
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.600]   this, but it seems that got much more guy jumping out of a balloon, got more attention
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.240]   to discovery, landing on Mars.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:40.000]   And which disheartened me a little bit, but then I realized why because it's a human being.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.680]   And unmanned space exploration just doesn't galvanize the imagination in the same way.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.600]   And yet I'd love to see the I'd love to see Red Bull sponsor the next discovery.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   Curiosity.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.720]   Why does reality TV get more, you know, pay get more traffic and user interest than
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.960]   you know, Jim layer on PBS, right?
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.960]   Right.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.920]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:08.240]   I mean, I, it's true that this guy certainly got a lot of press, but I think it depends
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.960]   on kind of which bubble you're inhabiting.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.160]   Like it didn't really make a ripple here.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.160]   I was at Comic Con and, you know, it wasn't on the giant jumbo trombone.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   Really in the big hall.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.480]   No, I mean, you know, people were watching the people dancing that hip hop rhythm game
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.680]   more than the whereas, you know, I saw the curiosity landing in NASA.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   And I think it was a lot of the things that we've been doing.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   And I think it was a lot of the things that we've been doing.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   And I think it was a lot of the things that we've been doing.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   And I think it was a lot of the things that we've been doing.

[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.680]   And it doesn't say "stunt control." It's his mission control.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   Right.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   Did it say mission control?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   Yeah, I did.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.680]   Yeah, it did.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   It totally did.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.680]   Well, there you go.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:51.680]   They should have called themselves like "Rabasa, Red Bull, Ariel's stunt team.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   "Rabast."
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   Of course, you know, it could have all been done in the studio just like the moon landing.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   I didn't have a possibility.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.680]   Yeah, I want to hear what Adam Curry has to say about that.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   He could say the whole thing was faked.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   I think he probably believes that.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   Well, everybody knows that the stars are hung in a firmament just above the Chrysler building.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   Right.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   Right.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   And the earth is in fact not revolving around the sun.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   It's the other way around.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   And anybody who says otherwise is just not paying attention.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   Did you see Saturday Night Live skit last night?
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   That was the other big story.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   CNET got a good plug.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   Yes.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.680]   CNET wired and Gizmodo.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680]   Right.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.680]   I'm not going to play it because NBC will immediately pull this podcast down from YouTube forever
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.680]   more.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.680]   They just have that.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.680]   We get that every week.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   And it's just too much trouble.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.680]   So I'm just going to leave this as an exercise for the listener.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   A Saturday Night Live skit, it was called Tech Talk.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:54.680]   The female host introduced three nerds and they really were a nerdy from seeing that,
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   Gizmodo and Wired.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.680]   The show starts with them whining about the iPhone.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   By the way, exactly as we have been doing for the last two weeks.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   The maps, progress, terrible.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.680]   The thing has dings.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   And by the way, it does have minds dinged up like crazy.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   And what was the third person?
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   Oh, the apps take too long to load or something like that.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   Right.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   And the flare.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.680]   If you point this at the camera and the sun, you get a purple flare.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   I don't like it.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.680]   I want to take pictures of the sun better.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   All of these are accurate depictions of how people were whining about the iPhone 5.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   Accurately or not accurately, the maps program is pretty bad.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   You do get a purple flare.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   But then I thought this is really, actually I thought it was kind of inspired.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   She introduces the three people from the Shenzhen plant in China that made the iPhone.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   And the pundits immediately say, "Can we leave now?"
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.680]   "No, it's a trap," she said.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:59.680]   And the Chinese workers break out of Chinese violin and do the dance of sarcastic dance
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   of misery.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   And it was actually very pointed talking about, frankly, the issue that geeks would love to
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   talk about the iPhone, but really don't want to talk about how it's made or where it comes
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   from.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   Or the fact that these are first world problems to the ultimate.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   Very, I mean, first world.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   Before the iPhone, we all hype it and make a ridiculously big deal about this phone,
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   which after all is a phone.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   Same can be said by the way for the new iPad mini.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.680]   It's just a tablet.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.360]   And then after it comes out, we make a huge deal about every tiny imperfection that we
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360]   can possibly find.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.280]   And neither the hype nor the gripes have anything to do with reality.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.880]   Well, they have something to do with reality, but they're way out of perspective.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.880]   But that's what we do.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   Not me.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   I didn't even know that.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.880]   I'm not curious.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   It's not me.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.880]   I'm not involved.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.880]   Not you, Leo.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   You don't do that.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.880]   No, I do it.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.680]   In fact, it would be as if you complained that GESP and spends an awful lot of time talking
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   about baseball.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   It's, I mean, this is, this is all we do.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.200]   So it's not like there are other things I could talk about.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.240]   And we certainly do talk about conditions in at Foxconn and so forth.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.520]   We have many times in the past.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.800]   But in fact, we've even debated the issue.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.880]   Should we be promoting the consumerism involved in getting a new phone every year or two and
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.280]   the high costs to the people who make the phone and so forth?
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.640]   We talk about that.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.320]   But I admit, we also talk a lot about the purple flare.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.360]   Wouldn't it be awesome if someone started making consumer electronics where the duty
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.040]   cycle and the material properties were sort of in harmony with one another so a device
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.280]   that you're intended to replace every 18 months was designed to gracefully degrade
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.920]   back into the part stream every 18 months rather than being made at materials that will
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.680]   last like, you know, 100,000 years in a landfill.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.200]   That's crazy talk, Corey.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.200]   I know.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.760]   I've seen your laptops, by the way.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760]   They do do great.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   It's about 18 months.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.880]   But you know, when I, when I, one of the ways that I was able to quit smoking was by the
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.880]   realization that I was spending a laptop a year on cigarettes.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   Wow.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.040]   And so now I buy myself a laptop every year.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.880]   I don't.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   And you put Linux on it.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   Nice.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   Nice.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   And I put Linux on it.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.880]   Ubuntu.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   What's your, what's your laptop currently?
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   What do you, are you still using Linux?
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   I got an X220.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.440]   The thing pads, it's, it's for the warranty because they'll do the onsite next day hardware
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.760]   replacement anywhere that IBM Global Services has an office.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.160]   So it's, it's like it costs as much as Apple care except a highly skilled technician will
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   come to your hotel room and fix it the day after breaks.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   Wow.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.160]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   That's amazing.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.480]   Oh, I'm sorry you've put Ubuntu on this.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.080]   No, totally not.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.840]   And in fact, because the hard drive comes out with one screw, I'm like, well, you know,
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.600]   if it's, well, assuming I'm back at my office, I'm like, I had the original drive here because
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.360]   I always, I always throw the hard drive out and put a big SSD and I've got, I've got,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.680]   you know, I've got the original hard drive here.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.040]   I can stick it in and boot it up.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.400]   I'm not going to click through the Ulas.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.080]   That can be your job, but you can see that it still doesn't work.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.080]   Awesome.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.080]   That's a, that's a good idea.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.160]   Never clicked a Microsoft Ula.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   Really?
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.160]   Since when?
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   Since ever?
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.360]   Well, since at least not at the OS level, I've certainly clicked some app level Ulas,
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   but never in OS.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.520]   And is that more, is that more a statement or do you actually worry about what you're
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   agreeing to?
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   Mm.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.080]   I kind of, there was one day when I realized it, it's kind of like, it's, it's kind of
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.400]   like uptime on a server.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.600]   It's like, you know, I reboot the server whenever it needs it.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.200]   And then one day you go, wait a second, this server hasn't been rebooted in like 22
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   months.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.600]   I'm never rebooting this server.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.120]   And from then on, it's like, you know, is there any way I can pack?
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.120]   I can't even crash the kernel without having to reboot it.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.120]   So, yeah.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.840]   So, so at a certain point you're like, you know what, I've never clicked a Ula on this.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.480]   When we, we, we got a, a Wii when my wife was pregnant and in the last couple of weeks
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.480]   when we were just sort of, she was a little over two, we were kind of hanging around the
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.520]   house and I went out and got a Wii.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.560]   And we didn't actually unwrap it until after my daughter was born.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.640]   And then the Ula comes up and I'm like, you know, I've got someone around the house
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.720]   who's not legally competent to form a contract.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.200]   I should get her to click the link.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   So I got my newborn daughter and I clicked the link.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.360]   I've got a photo of it.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   It's pretty good.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   It's in my Flickr stream.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.360]   No, sir.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.360]   I did not agree to that Ula.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.360]   Wow.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.280]   You know, many uses you can put your children to around the house.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   This is good.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.280]   You can't let Posey grow up now.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.200]   You've got to keep her around.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.360]   Um, anyway, it's interesting that there was so much attention on this, uh, tech talk,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.160]   um, uh, skit.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:43.480]   I think it, I think there's a little, uh, little guilt, little first word guilt in here.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.080]   But what do we do about it?
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.400]   Well, it's such a part of our culture, right?
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:54.160]   I mean, you know, electronics, um, tech is, it's what this says is something that, you
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.960]   know, we've seen over the past couple of years is really that mainstream media has embraced
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.760]   technology and realizes that it is, it has become such a part of everyday life.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   It's become such a part of consumers buying habits, of course, but also, uh, just the
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.280]   usage habits of everyone and especially smartphones and tablets have taken that, I think deeper,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.360]   um, and it, you know, to younger ages and older ages to the point where, you know, they're
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.280]   addicted to technology and it's such a part of everything they do.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.720]   And so obviously our, our industry in terms of technology journalism has, has grown and
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:36.160]   adapted and, um, you know, raised the tenor of the conversation, or I should say raised
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.760]   the, uh, maybe not the level of it, but the, uh, the noise level.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:47.160]   And so this is, I think this is just representative of that, of the fact that this stuff is just
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.960]   absolutely everywhere now.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.240]   I think it's also Apple.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.640]   I think Apple for some reason, uh, brings about a fascination on the part of mass media.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.480]   I understand that cause I'm in mainstream media and the level of interest from anything or
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.200]   for anything Apple so far exceeds the level of interest for anything else.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.280]   So let me ask you.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.600]   So in fact, we have the same issue, uh, Windows eight comes out next week or a week from
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:18.360]   a Thursday, you're going to be there waiting in line, covering it, talking to people waiting
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.720]   in line for Windows eight.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.800]   The first Windows eight machines, the CBS saying, Larry, we've got to get a man on the
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.000]   street for Windows eight.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.560]   Now, right, we're going to, we're going to be waiting in line in front of the, uh, the,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.160]   the Microsoft store in, in Times Square, uh, you know, we'll cover it.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.880]   Obviously there's interest in it, but it's not going to get the kind of coverage that
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.320]   any Apple event would get by, by an order of magnitude.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.280]   I mean, I, I don't think that's necessarily the right way to go, but I know the interest
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.160]   level and, uh, on the stations and it just isn't there, frankly, and they're a little
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.000]   bit, but not to the extent of Apple.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   You can't.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.160]   There's a re, there's a reason why Microsoft has been so coy about, you know, they haven't
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.920]   even said when it's officially released.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.200]   I mean, they haven't done a big push and said, this is when it's released.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   They still haven't told us how much it is.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.160]   All of that is Apple envy and Apple, um, you know, emulation, right?
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.360]   I mean, they're, they're trying to create that same kind of buzz.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.960]   They're not, they're not doing it particularly well, but, um, but by holding the price, you
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.600]   know, they're still keeping us talking about it.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.000]   And so that, that is working for them to a degree.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.560]   But I do think there is a certain level of, um, excitement and interest there for the
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.120]   Microsoft Surface and I think there will be a lot of hype about it the week that it comes
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   out.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.840]   Um, now it looks like it is coming out midnight.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.520]   The, um, the day of, um, yeah, 25th, 26, right?
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.280]   So, uh, I think there will be a lot written about it.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.600]   There probably will be people in line.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.120]   There probably will be, you know, come on Jason, nobody's going to wait in line for
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   Windows RT.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:55.400]   Oh, but when you wait in line for surface for surface, surface tab, the surface tablet,
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.840]   not for, uh, not for Windows certainly.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.840]   Let's take a break and come back.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.840]   I want to talk about this.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:06.640]   In fact, we have, uh, the first Windows eight ad, which Microsoft has started airing, which
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.080]   is awfully lot like an Apple ad, but we'll, we'll show you that in a second.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.880]   Jason Heiner is here from tech Republic.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.880]   Great to have you.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:21.400]   From Louisville, home of the slugger, Corey Doctorow, uh, of craphound.com and boy, boy,
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.600]   boy creator of the boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, and of course he's
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.760]   a New York touring with his new book.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   It's exciting.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.760]   My roots.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.720]   And, and his t-shirt, cause we can't see the whole thing says I read band comics.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.080]   The, uh, from the comic book legal defense fund, the sort of the ACLU of comics.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.080]   Amazing.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   That's such a thing.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.280]   It's just in this day and age.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.720]   Oh well.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.600]   And from CBS radio, Mr. Larry Maggad.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.600]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix, the makers of a great program.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.640]   If you have to do meetings, meeting is believing with go to meeting for a long time, go to
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.640]   meeting.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.400]   I've talked about it as the best screen sharing app out there, Mac or PC, but now they've
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.280]   added a new feature that makes it really more like a real meeting.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:15.960]   Not only you're seeing their screen, but you're meeting face to face with your team anywhere
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.680]   in the world with the new HD faces.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.720]   I have to say this, the quality of the video on the HD faces is spectacular.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.680]   And you can of course start a meeting on a Mac or PC, but you can attend a meeting on
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.520]   a Mac, a PC, an iPad, an iPhone, an Android tablet.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.240]   In fact, if you're using an iPad, you can actually use the camera, the headphones, the
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.080]   microphone on the iPad and be at a meeting anywhere in the backyard at a coffee shop,
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.760]   at a hotel, at an airport.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.280]   Just really works well.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:51.240]   Fast, easy to schedule a meeting, easy to join a meeting, which is important because
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.440]   after all, if you're meeting with a client, you're doing a sales pitch, you don't want
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.360]   to make it hard for them to meet with them.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.200]   You want to make it fun, engaging, interesting.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.720]   And I have to say, if you are in sales, the ability to see your client, for your client
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.480]   to see you to kind of build that rapport with the video is very important.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.520]   It really makes a big difference.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.160]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   You be the judge.

[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   It's just great.

[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.000]   You have something else to do with go to meeting.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.720]   Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.360]   We're giving away an iPad.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.360]   Exactly.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.360]   Thank you, Chad Johnson, producer.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.560]   Now he's earned you earned your key.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.040]   Thank you.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.520]   We're giving away, go to meetings giving away an iPad.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.240]   That's to remind you, you can use an iPad for go to meeting.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.640]   We want you to share your story.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.760]   Tell us where in the world you would meet and with whom you would meet and why you would
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.760]   meet with somebody.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.920]   Do this on Twitter though.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.320]   Don't make it a long story.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:21.920]   I would meet with Corey to talk about little brother in London and then you could use the
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.200]   hashtag TWIT free iPad.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.040]   That's important so that we can see all the entries.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.680]   We'll pick it random from those entries for next week.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.880]   We're extending it another week giving you one more week to perform.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.560]   This contest is for legal US residents only.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.640]   I'm sorry to say the lawyers made us do it.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.600]   Rules and regulations are online at inside.twit.tv.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.320]   So again, who you'd like to meet with?
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.920]   Where in the world?
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.720]   Why use the hashtag TWIT free iPad?
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.680]   That's very important you put that on there so we could find all the entries.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.680]   That's how we're going to collate them all and then we'll pick it random from an entry
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.560]   toward you an iPad and we're going to autograph it, put stuff on it.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.160]   It's going to be a nice iPad.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.120]   Winner of the contest will be announced on or about.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.200]   That lawyer must have written that on or about October 21st, 2012.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.800]   That means it could be anytime on or about.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.000]   I think it'll be on this show on October 21st, 2012 is what I think.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.360]   TWIT free iPads the hashtag but I've been wrong before.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.000]   If you don't, if you don't, see Mike says I don't want my iPad autographed.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.040]   If you don't want an autographed, no problem.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.960]   Just tell us and we won't.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.400]   Or we could write to eBay buyer if you prefer and just sign it that way.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.720]   Gazelle owner.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.000]   Windows 8 clicks off with its first official television commercial.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.720]   My first reaction is it looks just like one of them Apple ads.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   Here you go.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.680]   This is the first ad.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.640]   Good music.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   They blow up a laptop.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.440]   They hit a pinata.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.240]   They're playing tic-tac-toe.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.560]   It's the Metro interface.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.280]   Xbox video, they're watching.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:02.760]   They're playing Fruit Ninja on a giant screen and they're cinnamon buns.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.400]   Then the rocket has launched.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.880]   The girl draws on the tablet which is on an easel and somehow she gets a credit picture.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.520]   Now, what made that possible?
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.880]   Windows 8.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.280]   That is an iPad ad.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.640]   In fact, I bet you if you show that to 20 consumers without warning them ahead of time
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.600]   and you took that Windows 8 ad at the end, they'd say, "Oh yeah, that's the iPad ad."
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.840]   It's pretty uncanny, right?
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.480]   I mean, everything they do is copycat, right?
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.880]   I mean, I won't say that.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.480]   The interface itself, I'll give it a moment.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.480]   That's unique.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   That is absolutely unique.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480]   That's unique.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.400]   But they're go-to-market strategy as we call it in business, right?
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.760]   I mean, their stores look just like the Apple stores.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.280]   Their commercials look just...
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.240]   They don't have a whole lot of originality and I don't think they really try to.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:57.360]   The whole reason they're getting into devices is because Apple is now making...
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.200]   The iPhone is worth more than all of Microsoft, generates more revenue than all of Microsoft.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   The iPad now generates more revenue than the whole Windows division at Microsoft.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:13.280]   So they're following, they're not leading and they'll probably do okay at it.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.760]   I don't think they'll do as well as they did in the past when they've done this.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.400]   But they'll remain big enough to be sort of top five tech company.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.000]   That's by the way, that's also a very big story.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.800]   Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, basically saying, "Hey, we're reinventing the business."
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.040]   He said this in a shareholder letter.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.320]   Interestingly, and Paul Therat pointed this out to me, for the last couple of months,
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.280]   if you went to Microsoft.com and you looked at the title of the window, it would say,
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.440]   Microsoft homepage, devices and services.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.800]   This is the new mantra at Microsoft.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.080]   Steve Ballmer and a letter to shareholders, which is shared with everybody else, including
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:01.520]   the press and the...
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:09.520]   Let's see, stores and retailers and OEMs said basically, "We're changing the business."
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.320]   Last year in this letter, he wrote, "I said that over time, the full value of our software
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:19.840]   will be seen and felt in how people use devices and services at working in their personal
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.840]   lives."
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:27.600]   This is a significant shift, both in what we at Microsoft do and how we see ourselves
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.880]   as a devices and services company.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:35.760]   It impacts how we run the company, develop new experiences, how we take products to market.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.680]   What is Microsoft saying, Jason, when they say, "We're a devices and services company?"
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.240]   Again, they're a market follower, not a market leader.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:51.440]   The world has moved in that direction in terms of integration, vertical integration of hardware
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.440]   and software.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.200]   They're behind in that game.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.400]   Apple is killing it there.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.160]   They're going, "Hey, this is what we're going to have to do."
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.440]   Paul Throt says, "We want to be more like Apple.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.920]   Is that what they're saying?"
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:12.160]   I think a short translation of that might be, "We're about to hose all of our OEMs and
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.120]   you're going to have to pay us every month to go on using Windows."
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.160]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.960]   If you are Lenovo, Dell, or HP, you're going, "Huh."
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.960]   Did I just say that you have 45,000 unread emails in your inbox?
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.560]   You didn't send me an email last year and a half, did you, Corey?
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.000]   You're like inbox 1 million.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.440]   I'm trying to see how fast I get to 1 million.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.800]   Is this how many unread tweets?
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:49.720]   Because that's good too.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.640]   Wow, how's the itchy and stable looking there?
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:59.240]   I don't even, it's so funny because I often will just open email and then close it right
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.240]   away.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.480]   I'll take one look and I'll go, "No."
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.360]   Maybe I should declare an email holiday or whatever.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.280]   I'm making an email.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   Two thousand and thirteen can be your email holiday.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.440]   No, I'll tell you why I don't because then that would imply in some way that I was going
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.720]   to read the new email that came in after that.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   I'm not.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.320]   Yeah, don't do that.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.680]   No, I wouldn't want to read any of that.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   Yeah, so.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.280]   Well, how do you keep up?
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.320]   How do you keep up, Corey Doctorow, with email?
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.240]   I'm inbox zero, man.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.760]   So I've got a bunch of filters.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.920]   I hate people like you.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:40.080]   You point all of the, so my like tip top rule is every time you reply to someone, have your
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.480]   mail or add them to your address book, anytime something from someone in your address book
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.520]   comes in, drop that in a proper inbox and put everything else in a different inbox.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.520]   Oh, but wait a minute.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.520]   That's a big one.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.680]   That's not inbox zero.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:55.320]   That's just filters and then you have folders that are full of mail but your inbox is zero.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   No, no, no, no.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.560]   No because it means that you pay really close attention to your inbox and then you're holding
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.760]   pen of stuff that you're unlikely to look at.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.080]   I usually just sort that by subject once a day.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   Wow.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.360]   So that way anything that gets to the spam filter, you can just shift select like a whole block
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.120]   because it'll all have the same subject.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   Nuke that.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.880]   And what's left, you know, you go through really quickly.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:20.760]   My mailing list rule is to, if there's a mailing list that I need to be on, is I drop
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.160]   that into another folder unless my name is mentioned in the body of the email and then
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.160]   it goes into my inbox.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   You can put it into a piece of software, Corey.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   You need to write that in.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.160]   No, no, no.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.280]   Just caught Corey's inbox or something, right?
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   Yeah, it's like two lines and numbered.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.280]   Yeah, no.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.880]   Yeah, seriously, I sell it as a software as a service.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.880]   There you go.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.880]   Oh, so okay.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.960]   Back to software as a service.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.320]   So devices and services.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.520]   Now, Microsoft apparently because we just talked about that's the one that's weekly considers
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.680]   a computer a device.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.200]   I'm not sure I'd agree with them, but in this definition of devices and services, it's
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   not a person.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   Well, it's a machine, but a device implies to me a device applies mobile or Xbox.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.120]   It's like more like it's not, it's a device.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.120]   I don't know.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   I'm on a laptop.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.120]   I'm on a laptop.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.120]   It's not a device.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120]   It's a, it's a book.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   Oh, it's a book?
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.280]   No, but that, but, but I'm wrong obviously.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.320]   I think devices become a generic term for any piece of hardware and it's a word.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   It's a word.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.120]   Including tablets, phones, computers.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.560]   Well, then what they're saying is meaningless because they're defining devices as hardware
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   and services.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.720]   I bet you they're defining as software.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.560]   So they're saying we're in the hardware and software business.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.560]   Well, what?
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   So what?
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.280]   Doesn't, doesn't services also imply that you're renting or you're somehow providing
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.080]   it via the cloud versus, you know, in a box or, or, or a disk or even downloaded that
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:42.040]   there's something kind of dynamic and ongoing about this versus buying a copy of Windows
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.360]   or buying a copy of Microsoft Office and using it for two or three years, which is sort of
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.200]   the traditional model that Microsoft has exploited for the last, what, 30 years now?
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.000]   It's software as a service.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.080]   They took too long to realize their toast, right?
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.720]   Software's moved to the cloud.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   Right.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.760]   And OS is moving to hardware, essentially being bundled in the hardware.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.760]   It doesn't matter.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:07.560]   It's, you know, being, you know, it's, it's so, you know, far into the background that
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.840]   they realized what are we, what are we left with?
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.240]   You know, Microsoft Office trying to peddle that on as many different devices as we can,
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.760]   not a great business model.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.920]   So that's what devices and services is about.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   It's realized like, okay, the world's changed.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.320]   You know, we're not going to call ourselves a software company anymore.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.120]   We're going to call ourselves a devices and services company.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:30.400]   Not to be a course, but Corey, do you consider your Linux computer on that Lenovo X 22 as
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.400]   a device?
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   Yeah, sure.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.120]   Now I was just going to say like you're right that saying we're in the devices and services
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.480]   businesses like saying we're in the hardware and software business.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.840]   But you know, this points out that we live in a world that's now made of computers.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.920]   I mean, as your awesome DJ reads for your old Ford ads reminded me a number of times
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.120]   a computer is a car is a computer.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.120]   You put your body.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.120]   That's right.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:57.080]   You know, 747 is a flying Solaris box and an exotic case with a bunch of badly secured
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.560]   Scotta controllers.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:05.960]   You know, you've got a controllers at 747s, do they?
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.720]   That's what the Boeing engineers tell me.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.040]   Oh, that's depressed.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.920]   That's the controller that was used also on the centrifuges in the Iranian nuclear plants
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.400]   that were that were hacked with Stuxnet.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.880]   I mean, but it's, you know, it's like it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the computer science
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.160]  ization of the world.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.120]   Everything is made out of the same primitive is both in hardware and software.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   Right.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.280]   And that's not a bad thing.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:35.360]   No, although, you know, it's the problem is, and I've given a couple of talks about this
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:40.560]   that we don't really have a model for a computer that can run all the programs except for the
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.840]   one that might get you into trouble or pisses someone off or breaks someone's business model.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.800]   And yet the more computers we have, the more problems there are that arise that have a
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.680]   computer somewhere in them.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:55.080]   And the more people that are saying, can't you just build me, you know, a phone that runs
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:01.000]   all the programs except for the one that interferes with my SMS revenue stream or can't you just
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.840]   build me a 3D printer that can't print a solid state meth lab or an AR 15 or can't you just
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.320]   print me a self driving car, run, you know, make me a self driving car that can run all
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.280]   the programs except for the drag racing program.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.480]   And the closest approximation we have is not the appliance that only runs one program.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:19.360]   Actually, appliances run all the programs and have spyware on them that kind of swims
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.760]   up out of their depths and says, I can't let you do that, Dave, when you try to run the
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.800]   program that the manufacturer didn't expect you to run.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.240]   How is that going?
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.040]   Are they succeeding with that?
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.080]   Well, look at you, Effie on arm, right?
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:37.720]   I mean, there's there's there's platforms where now if you're not signed, you can't run.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:42.640]   And so you're you're essentially having to delegate all of your trust to the vendor with
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.120]   no ability to override the vendor's decisions.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   That's that's pretty intense.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:51.360]   I mean, I kind of feel like our destiny, you know, as members of the Walkman generation,
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.760]   the iPod generation is we're all going to end up with hearing aids.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.200]   And I really feel like it's important when I put a computer in my body that can like
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.520]   omit certain things that I hear or transmit things that I hear to other people that that
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:07.680]   computer be designed such that I can see what it's doing, it's not designed to hide any
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.520]   secrets from me the way that that you'd have to if you wanted to lock it to a single platform.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.880]   And that, you know, I can choose who I delegate my trust to.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.960]   I'm not pretending that I'm going to audit all that code.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.320]   But if someone comes out and says, Hey, it looks like there's something bad or wrongly
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.480]   implemented or vulnerable or or deliberately messed up about this, I want to be able to
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.160]   change vendors.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:35.800]   So of course, this is all happening because of fear, as usual, fear is a great motivator.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.520]   Fear over privacy concerns, fear over security concerns end up putting, you know, we have
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.320]   security except from the people who design this stuff.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.800]   Yeah, sure.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.800]   I mean, you know, I think that we've seen in the last couple of years a growing market
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:56.760]   for lawful interception devices where, you know, the the Kalya standard that says that
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:02.360]   in the US all switches have to have back doors for law enforcement has meant that all over
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.760]   the world, anyone who wants to sell a switch in the US makes it so that it's got a backdoor
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.400]   for law enforcement that back door is frequently compromised by other entities, sometimes state
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.240]   actors and sometimes crooks.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.280]   And then, and then, you know, that that gets good to law enforcement.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:23.960]   The wiretappers ball in DC every year features more and more ways that state actors and police
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.800]   agencies can interfere with your devices to wiretap you.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.640]   And it kind of culminated last year when Jacob Applebaum went to the wiretappers ball
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:38.320]   and out at vendor that was selling a network appliance you put in the data center for your
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.960]   national carrier.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.600]   And then you gave it the email address of someone in your country who's using iTunes
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.320]   and it waited for them to try and phone home to Apple to get an iTunes update.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.920]   And then it shipped them a malware button that remotely operate the camera, the microphone,
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:58.360]   any kind of location sensors read the hard drive, the screen, the keyboard and so on.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:02.720]   So, you know, when you've got when you've got state actors actually creating markets
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.960]   for zero days instead of creating markets and instead of creating incentives for people
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.480]   who find vulnerable vulnerabilities to disclose them so they can be patched.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:16.600]   Now there's a market to sell those vulnerabilities to governments and also to introduce those
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   vulnerabilities.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.960]   So you've got something to sell because obviously those things are worth a lot of money.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:27.480]   These like Vupen and France are making Bitcoin, you know, selling to Spooks.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.960]   That was kind of the story at Black Hat and the Defcon this year was sure how many people
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.480]   were buying exploits at governments.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.360]   Yeah, I think that I mean, I think that's a huge risk.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:43.200]   I think we create this horrible perverse incentive to make computers less secure even as we start
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.800]   putting computers in our bodies and our bodies into computers.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   I mean, it's a kind of a perfect storm of horrible dystopian technology.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.320]   In August you wrote an article for a Boing Boing that comment.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.800]   Well, actually it was a speech you gave, I should say, at the Long Now Foundation in
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   July.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.920]   But it's in Boing Boing, the coming civil war over general purpose computing.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.560]   Yeah, and I gave that speech at Defcon and at Google and at Long Now this summer.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:10.080]   It was the follow up to a talk I gave at Chaos Computer Congress called, or Communications
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.040]   Congress called the coming war over general purpose computing.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:18.640]   The two of them kind of go together as a kind of both a warning and a manifesto about
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.520]   how our devices should be designed.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:26.080]   Corey, could you just sum up like the top like two or three bullet points of your thesis?
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:31.800]   Yeah, basically that since we don't know how to design devices that can only run the programs
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.720]   that don't upset people and because lawmakers increasingly are seeing computers as the place
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:44.100]   where they can insert control, we've got this ongoing motif in our fights where people
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:49.020]   are saying, "You need to accept that your computer won't run the software you choose,
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:54.060]   that we're going to be able to keep secrets from you so that we can lock your platform
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.820]   so that it will only run the programs that are approved."
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.780]   And that when you do that, you create these vulnerabilities in the computers that let
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.660]   bad guys do really bad things to them, whether those bad guys are the Iranian government
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:11.340]   if you live in Iran or the rent to own companies, like the rent to own companies that just settled
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.380]   with the FTC because they had LoJack, the laptops, they were renting people.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.380]   You're kidding.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:21.380]   Oh yeah, seven rent to own companies and a software company in Pennsylvania just settled
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:27.460]   with the FTC because they LoJack, their rental laptops and they were secretly recording the
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.540]   renters of these laptops having sex and they were recording their children and they were
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.700]   intercepting their medical records, their communications with their lawyers and their
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.860]   banking records and the FTC said to them, "As you'd imagine," and they said, "You must
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:41.860]   stop doing this.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.620]   You're not allowed to do this anymore unless you put it in the fine print."
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.780]   You didn't inform people that you were planning on doing it.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:49.780]   Then it's okay.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.820]   You're not put in the fine print from now on and then it'll be okay.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:53.820]   Wow.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:54.660]   So this is where...
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.660]   Go ahead.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.660]   Sorry, go ahead, Leah.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:02.020]   I was just saying, this is actually, I really do feel like over the next decade, probably
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:10.580]   decades, one of the primary tensions in the digital world, right, is we...
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:17.060]   On the one hand, as Corey was mentioning earlier, this greater regulation around the
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.860]   internet, we need to realize that the internet is in many ways a lifeline and will continue
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:28.380]   to be and will be even in a greater extent for economic well-being, for healthcare, for
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.220]   lots of different things.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:34.860]   We need a certain level of regulation and government involvement to make sure the playing
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:38.060]   field remains level, make sure that costs stay down and all that.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:44.420]   On the other hand, too much government involvement in the internet leads to trouble as well,
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:51.820]   to where a single point of failure, as well as government takeover and all of that, to
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:57.900]   the point that you need the commercial free enterprise system to provide redundancy and
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:05.300]   choices and these types of things in order to keep it more free and more able to not
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:12.420]   be taken over by a government or government and shut down, right?
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:16.540]   So that's one of the key tensions that we've got to figure out.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.980]   The problem is that if not so much that whether government gets involved, it's that government
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.220]   has a way of getting involved in ways that are just not smart.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:28.740]   And going back in this country, the Communications Decency Act, the Children's Online Privacy
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:34.300]   Protection Act, the Delete Online Predator's Act, there's act after act after act that
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.700]   are purportedly to protect people.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.380]   They all have very high-minded goals.
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.020]   They all get overwhelming support, at least initially from Congress.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.980]   And then when you look at them carefully, when you actually sort of dissect them, you
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.340]   find that they have huge flaws in them.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.860]   And it strikes me we have two parties when it comes to technology.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:57.220]   We have the Clued-In Party and we have the much larger Clueless Party and the Republicans
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.340]   and Democrats in both of them.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:03.380]   And as somebody who spends a lot of time in Washington, mostly on the Internet Safety
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:09.020]   side, I see an enormous amount of lack of understanding not only about how the Internet
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:14.540]   works but how it should work and how does government interrelate with companies and
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:20.100]   with the larger community that's using this technology and total cluelessness when it comes
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.980]   to the fact that this is an international media.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.900]   You cannot control it from any given country, whether you're Iran or for that matter of
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.900]   the United States.
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.500]   Yeah, and I do think some of that Cluelessness is going to age out, right?
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.700]   I mean, over the next decade, some of these people, I believe, and maybe I'm being overly
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.100]   optimistic, right?
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.180]   But some of that is going to age out.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:44.820]   The people who understand because they've been users of this for the earliest points they
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:52.660]   can remember will be Clued-In to a degree, not to the full degree, maybe, as all of us
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.660]   because we live and breathe it every day.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:59.900]   But I do think some of that's going to age out, some of it's going to, and not all of
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.700]   it's an age thing, more of it's an experience thing, right?
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:11.780]   But the thing is, we have this issue that I think is also at the fundamental part of
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:16.940]   this, which is the economics of the digital age, and that's a lot of this sort of free
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:20.620]   enterprise versus government control of the web.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:25.260]   And it gets into this whole tracking issue, by the way, big story this weekly, I don't
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.980]   know if you have this on the agenda or not, but the whole thing with the Apple's way of
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:36.380]   turning off ad tracking in iOS 6, which if you happen to know a lot about the way the
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.700]   phone operates, you might be able to figure out, but if you're just a normal person, it
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.980]   would be impossible.
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.180]   I had to write an article called, "Do the not to..."
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:46.940]   That's the intuitive way to turn off iPhone ad tracking, and I had to kind of...
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.260]   That's ironic because wasn't Google trying to get around the fact that Apple had disabled
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.900]   ad tracking in Safari?
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:58.460]   In Safari, this is on iOS 6, and if you go to your iPhone and you go to the privacy area,
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.940]   you're not going to find ad tracking.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:02.980]   You're going to have to go to general, and then about, and it just goes on.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.980]   Are you talking third party cookies?
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.980]   Is that the...
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.500]   I'm talking about this thing, I'm reading my own piece here.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.620]   This thing that took place at the UDID, it's another kind of Apple ad tracking, so-called
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:18.740]   non-permanent, non-personal device identifier, I'm quoting now, that advertising networks
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.980]   we use to give you more control over advertising's ability to use tracking methods.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:27.020]   In other words, by default, iOS 6 is trackable.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.940]   The apps you use, the websites you go to, it is by default trackable.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.780]   You could turn it off if you have an engineering degree from MIT.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.820]   I'm going to say, because I'm looking in the privacy settings, and I don't see anything
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:37.820]   there.
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:42.900]   Yeah, go to Larry's World and scroll down for it, and not so intuitive way to turn off
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.900]   iPhone ad tracking.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.500]   I thought that complicated, but you would never figure it out just by going to the obvious
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.500]   places.
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.340]   You need to go to preferences, Larry's World.
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:54.700]   You need to send me a check for $75.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:59.980]   It's not under privacy, it's in general about, I'm going to do it right now, because that's-
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.980]   Exactly.
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:04.380]   But the, you know, oh, God, we could just get into so many conversations.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:08.820]   By the way, if you're one of those people who listens to Twit at one and a half or two
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:13.580]   X speed, you might want to go to half speed now, because you're not going to be able to
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:14.660]   follow any of this.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:15.660]   So let me see.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.220]   Okay, I'm going to a general.
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.220]   Okay.
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:19.460]   And then I'm going to click on about.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.460]   And sure, it's in the about section.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:22.460]   That would make sense.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.460]   And scroll all the way down.
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.700]   And at the very bottom-
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.700]   There you go.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:26.700]   You got to be advertising.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:27.700]   That's interesting.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:28.700]   Limit ad tracking.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:29.700]   There it is.
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:30.700]   There it is.
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:32.700]   Now is that a do not track cookie?
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.700]   What is that?
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.700]   A limit ad.
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.420]   Not a do not limit.
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:37.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.740]   What does that?
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.060]   Only track us a little bit.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:44.020]   And is it only with Apple's own I ads or is it with other services?
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.020]   It's not very-
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.020]   It's-
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.540]   Well, again, I'm quoting from Apple.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:53.740]   A non-permanent, non-personal device identifier that advertising networks will use.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.540]   So a cookie, in effect.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.540]   In effect.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:00.780]   If you know anything about any kind of style, that dialogue box would be called "Beware
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:05.540]   of the Leopard."
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.140]   You want to explain what that means?
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:11.140]   Oh, it's from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when he discovers his place is about
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.140]   to be knocked down.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.980]   And he said, and the man from the town comes by and says, "Well, you know, the plans have
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.380]   been on display for quite some time."
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.900]   And he says, "Well, I went to see them.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.620]   They were in a third sub-basement behind a locked door that said, 'Beware of the Leopard."
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.620]   And he said, "Yes, that's the display room."
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:25.620]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:30.660]   By the way, we just got a tweet from Benjamin Mayo says, "The new IOS 6 limit ad tracking
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.540]   is better than the implementation in iOS 5."
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.620]   So, and so- Well, there we go.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.460]   So there you go, folks.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.460]   Even better.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.460]   And you thought it wasn't better.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.460]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:41.700]   We're going to take a break.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.260]   I need a breather before all that.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:49.780]   By the way, Microsoft is going to- if you'd like that ad, Microsoft's going to spend $1.5
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:56.420]   billion on more ads for Windows 8, $1.5 to $1.8 billion according to Forbes.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.660]   But it needs the money.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.860]   The largest product launch in the history of the industry.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.860]   Wow.
[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:04.700]   Now, let's start after the presidential ads go off the air.
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.940]   That would be nice that we could just- Yeah, we'll keep the media alive another year.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:12.180]   Maybe they could do attack ads on Apple and Android.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.740]   Oh, my, my, my, my.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:16.740]   We're brought to you today.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:17.740]   I'm going to do an ad.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.220]   It's not a Microsoft ad.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.220]   I'll do an ad.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.860]   We're brought to you today by Carbonite.com.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:22.860]   Backup done right.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.660]   What if I were going to design backup, the ideal backup scenario?
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.580]   What I would do is I'd make it automatic so you don't have to remember because I'm not
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.580]   going to remember.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.740]   Even if, you know, all with Sunday, it's time to- No, no, that's not going to work.
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:37.300]   It should be continuous because you create new content all the time.
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:42.260]   You write a paragraph and you're- you know, you're a great American novel or in Cory's
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:47.580]   case, the great British novel and you hard drive crashes, you lost that paragraph unless
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.260]   it's continually backing up.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.340]   That's the idea.
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.180]   It also doesn't just backup locally.
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.980]   It backs it up to the cloud.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.980]   So if there's a real disaster, fire or flood or somebody steals your stuff or you'll leave
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:04.740]   your laptop on the conveyor belt at the airport and it's gone poof, you got it backed up.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.300]   You got it backed up on Carbonite.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:12.660]   The better backup plans, secure, automatic, online backup, $59 a year for everything on
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:13.660]   a computer.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.900]   That's less than $5 a month now.
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:19.260]   They do have plans for business, flat rates for multiple computers, external drives and
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.260]   so forth.
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.780]   Basic plan, great for a laptop or an individual, $59 a year.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.700]   I want you to try it free for two weeks.
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.100]   It does use your internet access.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:31.820]   It doesn't slow you down or the internet but you should try it to make sure you're comfortable
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.020]   with it.

[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:12.460]   But you also can use trust no one, local encryption only, you have the key if you choose
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.940]   as well.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:18.020]   Carbonite.com, use our offer code TWIT.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:19.020]   Thank you, Larry.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.020]   This was useful.
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.980]   I have now turned that off although I don't know what I turned off or whether it makes
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:23.980]   any difference.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.980]   And frankly, there probably is a similar setting in Android or maybe not.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:27.980]   I don't even know.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.140]   Leah, do I ever tell you how I back up my novels?
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.140]   How do you?
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:40.540]   Because yeah, I mean, I have a friend, Amy Tan, novelist who was it Amy?
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:44.220]   Who's living in the Oakland Hills during that fire lost a novel like it burned.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:45.700]   Her backup bird, her print out.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:46.700]   So what do you do?
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.700]   Because that would be horrible.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.260]   Yeah, I know that would suck and I travel a lot.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.460]   So I archive my papers with a library in Toronto called the Merrill Collection, which
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.540]   is the largest public science fiction reference collection in the world.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.620]   And one day the head librarian said to me, you know, it's such a pity because in the
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:03.700]   old days when we archived manuscripts, we get like a first draft, a second draft, a
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.100]   third draft and they'd be distinct and we could study them and see the differences.
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:11.620]   Now it's just like a continuous document that's edited until it's submitted and done.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.340]   If only there was a way to keep track of changes to text.
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:16.940]   Oh no, you're not using Git.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:17.940]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:23.940]   So my friend Thomas Gideon, my friend Thomas Gideon from the command line podcast, wrote
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.780]   me a set of Git scripts that are on GitHub.
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.780]   It's called Flashbake and every 15 minutes or however long you run, however often you
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:33.620]   run the cron, it grabs all my working files.
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:38.740]   It grabs the difference and then it commits them along with it figures out where I am
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:42.500]   from the IP address, gets the weather, the last three headlines I put on Boingo in the
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.700]   last three songs I've played in my player.
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:48.700]   So it's kind of I have a like on a paragraph by paragraph basis, all of this.
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:51.820]   And then I can mirror that up to another Git server.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:55.540]   So I've got it, I've got it locally and I've got it mirrored up every couple of 10 minutes.
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:59.380]   So it's, it's super secure and kind of right up to the minute.
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380]   Nice.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.580]   And I love it to the back zip, what you're playing to.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.580]   There's not even a software that's in the store.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.660]   You're a thousand years from now, there's going to be all these electronic manuscripts
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.620]   kind of like, you know, when you look at the works of Shakespeare and get to see what he
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.420]   scratched out, we'll have that.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.420]   Well, I'm kind of.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.420]   Dr. O2.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:18.860]   Yeah, I'm kind of thinking, you know, like, apart from the risk of what happens if the
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:23.340]   database is compromised, you know, really you could capture it on a keystroke by keystroke
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:28.780]   basis and you could also grab a picture, you could grab, you know, skin galvanometry from
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:32.060]   the touch pad, you could, you could probably estimate pulse from the camera because a
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:36.460]   good camera can now estimate pulse if it can see your neck and so on.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:39.700]   So you could get a whole lot of biometrics and you could kind of go like, you know, sort
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:44.060]   of endocrinologically, how does that, what, how does, how does my endocrine system relate
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.820]   to my pros output and the tricky to think, right?
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.820]   I quit.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.820]   That's right.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:49.820]   That's right.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:50.820]   That's right.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:51.900]   But then the key is to, you know, you've got all this data.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:52.900]   What do you do with it?
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:57.180]   And I guess that's where we're kind of getting better at big data and then analyzing it.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.060]   I think, you know, in 10 years, I turn it over.
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.540]   I mean, I had a weird guy.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.540]   But who's going to want it?
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.540]   Well, you're famous.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.540]   People want it.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.540]   I'm a scholar, right?
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.460]   Yeah, some scholar might, but most people who wants, I mean, I think a Gordon Bell who,
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.820]   you know, he had the cameras wearing.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.140]   So who's going to want that?
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.860]   My kids don't even want the photo album I took of them.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:15.860]   Sure.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.580]   I mean, Charlie Strauss says it's the beginning of history, that it's the first time that
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:22.500]   we'll actually know about the minutiae of the lives of everyday people.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:26.020]   I had a weird thing last summer that I think is kind of a harbinger of a bunch of stuff
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.580]   that's going to happen, which is an old friend of mine who is a coder who had known since
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:34.460]   we were both coders and we were young teenagers died unexpectedly in his sleep with his computer
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.460]   on in his room.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.460]   Oh, dear.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.220]   His parents didn't know what to do.
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.780]   And you know, he didn't look at his parents, but his roommates didn't know what to do.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.540]   His parents didn't know what to do.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.180]   And I said, look, let me just back this up and put it somewhere for you until you figure
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.180]   out what to do with it.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:51.900]   So I went and grabbed a terabyte of data off of his hard drives, which I've stuck in S3
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:56.420]   and prepaid 10 years for and in a big password protected zip archive that they have the password
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.420]   to.
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.860]   And I figure in 10 years, they'll figure out what to do with it.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.220]   This is his whole life, right?
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:04.540]   And it's stuff that's compromising that that should never see the light of day and it's
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.820]   stuff that should never ever be thrown away.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.220]   That's precious and irreplaceable.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:14.940]   His, you know, some of his correspondence, his photos, his writing, his code.
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:20.380]   And I think we as a society have totally not figured this out and no kidding about to run
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:21.380]   up against this.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.380]   What do we do?
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.380]   There's a huge business there.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.300]   Do you plan for I've asked all of you guys, but I'll start with Corey for your death and
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.300]   what happens?
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.300]   Have you a little bit?
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.300]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:37.420]   So a couple of years ago, a writer named Mike Ford, John M. Ford died in test state and
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:43.620]   his common law wife wasn't legally entitled to run his estate and his estranged parents
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.900]   who are very religious and didn't approve of his work were and they wanted to suppress
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.260]   his work.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:55.140]   And a lot of his writer friends, particularly Neil Gaiman rallied around and sort of through
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.940]   argument and money and lots of other things at them until they agreed to let his work
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.900]   go on to be in print.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.740]   And after that, Neil Gaiman went on a tear and made all of his writer friends create
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.580]   living wills or wills where they had literary estate.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.620]   So I've nominated a literary executor is John Scalsy.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:15.420]   And then I've taken my hard drive password and I split that into two and half of it's
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.180]   with a lawyer in the UK and half with a lawyer in the US.
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.300]   And there's instructions for what to do when you get them back to decrypt my hard drive,
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.180]   which has all my other passwords on it.
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.740]   And so I've actually gotten that far, but I haven't gotten as far as figuring out how
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.060]   to tell people what I want done with the data apart from my writing.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:38.620]   You know, and I've got I've got logo programs I wrote on an Apple two plus in 1979 on my
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:41.620]   hard drive and everything since.
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.580]   It's really challenging to think about Jason.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.580]   Have you done any?
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.740]   I mean, Corey, you've done more than anybody I've ever I've ever heard of.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.740]   Yes, I hear.
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.740]   Same here.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.140]   No, I mean, as soon as you have kids, you start to think about this kind of stuff a
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.140]   lot, right?
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:58.260]   I mean, I've got a will and you know, the trust and all that stuff, but that's just material
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.860]   possessions really in many ways.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:02.300]   The product of your ideas, that's of your mind.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.300]   That's more valuable.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.620]   What happens to that?
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:05.620]   It's true.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:11.700]   You know, I've got stuff on on my machines, you know, even like writing stuff that I want
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:16.860]   to publish eventually, you know, lots of half done things, projects.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:22.820]   It's like what happens to that stuff, even, you know, journal stuff, electronic journaling
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:23.820]   and all of that.
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:27.140]   So yeah, I've been my my wife and I've talked a little bit about that.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:32.500]   Like what do we, you know, do, you know, leave the passwords and obviously a lot of us on
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:38.660]   drives right now, external drives and so that stuff other people can get at, right?
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.660]   If something happened.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.380]   So that's the extent to the what I've done so far.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.860]   But this is definitely a topic that I've thought a lot about because there's some stuff
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.380]   that it's kind of like a big history buff.
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:56.220]   And if you look at the past, you know, you look at even like founding fathers in the
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:00.860]   US, you have the two models, you have the Thomas Jefferson, George Washington model and
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.340]   you have the John Adams model.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.300]   John Adams saved every frickin thing that he had, right?
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.500]   Organized it, codified it.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:09.740]   When he died, you had everything.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.500]   So now we go back on a week, see his shopping lists.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.740]   We see, you know, all of his letters to his wife.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.100]   They saved everything.
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:21.420]   Whereas you look at Jefferson and Washington, they torched about half their stuff, right?
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:26.060]   And the other stuff that is kept is the stuff they wanted history to be able to look at.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:29.220]   Probably the most interesting stuff is the stuff they got rid of, right?
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:33.580]   And so, you know, we don't really know them to a certain degree.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:38.420]   But it's like that for all of us individually to lesser degrees for our families, right?
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:41.020]   What's the stuff we want to keep that we want them to see?
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.420]   And what's the stuff that we don't?
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:46.620]   And, you know, even deciding between that stuff is there's some hypocrisy in that as
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:47.620]   well.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.620]   But yeah, it's just a really interesting question.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:52.060]   I want a dead man switch that just deletes everything.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.860]   Well, you know, I don't want to save it.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.900]   I don't want anybody to have to go through it.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:00.100]   Just about everything that I have that I would want anyone to see is already been published.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.500]   I'm not working in a book at the moment.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.220]   So pretty much when I get an idea right about it, I publish it, it's in the ether.
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:09.420]   And I have other stuff that frankly I've password protected because I don't really necessarily
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.060]   want anybody to see it.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.860]   And I wouldn't mind if that got shredded along with me at some point.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.260]   But I think the big problem for everybody, whether you don't have to be a journalist
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:22.300]   or an author to have this problem, are all of the passwords to all of your accounts.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.900]   I mean, you're investment accounts, your bank accounts, what happens?
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:31.580]   You have a significant other and you know, they don't know the passwords.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.860]   And you should be changing your passwords frequently.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:37.060]   And do I always update my wife every time I change my bank account?
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.060]   There's a business here.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.060]   I don't.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.060]   There's a business.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.900]   You know, Brian Brushwood and Patrick Delahandy created Afterlife, right?
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:43.900]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.900]   Have they done anything with this?
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.020]   Afterlife.me, L-Y-F-E.
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:54.660]   I believe that it was the original service was to tweet you like it would it would keep
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.660]   the record now.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:56.660]   Right.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.100]   It would keep a record of your year.
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.900]   And once you died, it would retweet everything that you had done the past year.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:08.300]   So your family, your friends would see you in a year forever.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.300]   And then.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.660]   I think that's interesting now, little on a year from now.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.620]   But now it's like to preserve his dock, his passwords and stuff too, right?
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.900]   I don't know if it's gotten that far yet.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:23.140]   But that was the idea was that you could not really have that functionality.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:27.980]   And if you wanted to start a fairly easy, pretty human labor intensive, but not super
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:34.460]   high tech startup, you basically fan out business development guys and Chino's and Blue
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:40.380]   Shirts to all the funeral homes in the country and another set to all the major services,
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:44.980]   all the registrars, all the certificate authorities, all the major webmail providers and social
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.260]   networks.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.580]   And you on the social network side, you say, look, we're going to certify that people
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.100]   are really dead and who is managing their estate.
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.100]   And when we do that, we want you to give us a set of login credentials.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.660]   And then you go to all the funeral directors and you say, when someone comes in while you're
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.900]   selling them the aluminum casket they don't need, I want you to also sell them a service
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:10.060]   where we will certify that you are really the dead person's kind of person managing their
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.540]   affairs.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:18.060]   And we will we will mediate with you to Google Yahoo Facebook, Twitter, none of whom will answer
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:22.060]   have any kind of customer service department that will actually speak to an individual
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.180]   and we'll get you the login credentials for your loved ones, everything so that you can
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:30.380]   keep paying the bills or shut them down or put in an autoresponder or send it the funeral
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.140]   notice to everyone in their Facebook group or what have you in the event that you don't
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.340]   have that password.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.020]   And then you just throw a bunch of stuff and when you say, oh, I promise that we're like
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.580]   super secure about this.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:45.740]   We never ever, ever, ever let anyone get all those logins without the without someone
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:48.820]   really being dead, even though it's, you know, a giant attractive nuisance.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.900]   And everyone would believe you and you could make a ton of money because those funeral directors
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:54.460]   are really good at selling stuff to grieving people.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:58.420]   But before we go, don't get people, don't get people have privacy rights.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.860]   I mean, what about what are the privacy rights people who are dead?
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:05.780]   Well, you can't liable a dead person, which I find pretty interesting.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:10.340]   I think people, dead people do have privacy rights, but I think that most of us who've
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:14.900]   died and haven't thought about it, probably would like that some of that stuff would
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.900]   be preserved, right?
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:19.340]   I mean, in the absence of any explicit wishes, I don't know what courts do.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.700]   Mark Twain did that with his biagra.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.700]   He's auto biographer.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.460]   He got published 100 years later, right?
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.460]   Just recently.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.500]   But France, Kafka, you know, he told Max Brod burn all my papers when I'm dead.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.260]   And Max Bro was like, yeah, I'll do that.
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.260]   You don't worry.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:32.260]   Franz.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.260]   And then he died and he had them all published.
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.660]   And I always think, you know, if if Franz really wanted them burned, he knew where the fireplace
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.660]   was right.
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:38.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:39.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.820]   That looks like a hesitation mark to me.
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.460]   You cut this way, not that way, man.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:47.700]   That's a wink, wink, nudge, nudge, if ever I heard you burn them all.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:52.020]   The past that we're depressing the crap out of the chat room.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.220]   They're all there easily to press.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.980]   They've been depressed for five years.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.140]   For some reason, I'm fascinated.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:02.820]   Maybe it's because of my age, you know, and many of my friends are dead now.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:08.740]   But I just, it seems like it just seems like there's something that nobody, I mean, will
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:09.740]   is one thing.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:13.020]   I mean, but even like what happens to your Facebook account?
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:16.780]   Now, if you, if you pass, I want to, I think you should, I think there should be a way
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.860]   to create a site that's like your memorial site.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:20.420]   Like, yeah, Facebook actually does it.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:25.180]   They actually have a way to memorialize your page and your friends can make comments.
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.180]   And then there's the issues of what happens when people bully you after you die and Facebook
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.900]   actually tells you, no, it's true.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.460]   They have there, there are, there are, it's really terribly tragic, but there are cases
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.100]   of teenagers who have been bullied and died or killed themselves.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.700]   And then they continue to get bullied and it's a big deal.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.900]   It's a big problem, actually.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.340]   Facebook also posts boredom bullying on the next.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.820]   What Facebook also pushes ads with dead people's pictures in them, you know, your uncle Bob's
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:50.820]   that's bad.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:51.820]   That's not good.
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:52.820]   That's not good.
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:57.020]   It's showing up stuff that, you know, with uncle Bob retweeting or, you know, refeeding
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:03.620]   his, his, you know, his love for, for Resident Evil four, whatever is, whatever is getting
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.060]   sponsored pushes that week.
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.060]   Well, have that.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.860]   And uncle Bob also gets to vote several times too for another 20 or 30 years.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:15.540]   You know, by 2050, Charlie Strauss told me that by 2050 half the people who've ever used
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.540]   the internet will be dead.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.180]   And then what?
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.260]   Well, so the internet will be more dead than alive, right?
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:25.220]   The more the users of the internet will be dead than alive.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.180]   I try to have an ethernet cable, you know, in the, in the grave.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.580]   So I'll continue to use it.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:35.140]   You know, all of this is a product of the fact that over the past 15 to 20 years, right?
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:38.940]   All of this is, is changing and happening so fast, right?
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.940]   So fast.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:45.340]   I mean, we can't barely keep up with the day to day changes of this stuff, let alone sort
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:49.340]   of the 20,000 foot view, the big picture changes of what does this mean for our lives and the
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:54.340]   ways that we're putting our thoughts and ideas and, you know, organizing our lives around
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.660]   all of this digital stuff.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:12:00.140]   You know, this is stuff that's going to take, it's going to take a long time to figure out.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:07.020]   And there's going to be some stuff that gets lost and, you know, mangled in the process,
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.020]   unfortunately.
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:12.260]   We're going to take a break, but there's a big story just breaking and we'll have it
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.260]   for you.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.980]   Softbank just bought sprint.
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:17.980]   Oh, there were rumors that this was happening.
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:25.180]   Remember Deutsche Telekom tried to sell a T-Mobile to AT&T that was turned back by regulators.
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:28.460]   And it made everybody wonder, well, what happens to sprint?
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:34.500]   And of course, the great fear was if T-Mobile gets sold and, and, or merged with AT&T and
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:38.060]   then sprint goes away, we'll have two carriers, bad enough with four carriers.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.820]   Well, we'll have the details on that and your thoughts too.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:47.300]   I know that's a very US centric story, but something we're interested in in just a second.
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.420]   But first, let's talk about, you know, I was just thinking maybe you could make a Squarespace
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:56.300]   site prepay, you know, like a hundred years and then you would have your, the site where,
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.580]   you know, your, your, your, your memorial.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.420]   How long do you want to last?
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:07.540]   Squarespace should start, uh, start some sort of infinite deal like, like forever as long
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.740]   as we're around.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:11.420]   But how long is any of us going to be like Squarespace?
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.620]   How long is Google going to be around?
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.540]   Is Google going to be around a hundred years?
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:21.820]   Facebook, you'll be able to buy it on a thumb drive.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:25.500]   For a buck for, I mean, we don't, the world is changing so fast now.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.380]   We don't even really know what it's going to look like a hundred years from now.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:32.380]   It's pretty sure it's not going to look anything like, uh, we look like to a hundred years
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.380]   ago.
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:36.060]   Yeah, I think Google will come in injection form in a hundred years.
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.300]   Yeah, who knows?
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.860]   The Singularity is nigh.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.220]   You wrote a book about the Singularity.
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.220]   Your last book.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:45.660]   Well, kind of an extended joke about the singularity as well as a bit of a love note to it and a,
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:50.540]   and a kind of sarcastic doubting note, but, but maybe an intervention with the singularity
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.540]   and Charlie Strauss.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:52.540]   That's what we need.
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:54.100]   That's this book, Rapture of the nerds.
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.100]   We'll talk about that too.
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.900]   I want to, I do want to, it's a great book.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:57.900]   I want to talk more about that.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:02.620]   First, let's do the, squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:06.100]   The new square spaces here, their version six of their software completely rewritten
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.100]   from the ground up.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.060]   50 new features.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.900]   One of the key features is squares.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:15.380]   This was something that square space really knew they had to do used to be in days gone
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:19.000]   by last year when you made a site, you'd make it the desktop site and the mobile site.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.580]   But now more than half of your visitors to almost any site are mobile.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:26.540]   Does it make even, it makes sense to have a separate mobile site anymore?
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:32.420]   The space says no, square space and most modern web designers say one size fits all.
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.340]   What we're going to do is make a site using something called responsive design that will
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:41.380]   be appropriate no matter what size screen whether you're using an iPhone or a Galaxy
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:47.540]   Note 2 or something even bigger, like a 27 inch iMac.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:48.540]   So go to square space.
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:50.020]   I'm not going to tell you, I don't, and I don't do this.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.180]   I should be more clear about this.
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.180]   This is two things.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.420]   Hosting, the best hosting ever.
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.220]   It never goes down.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.060]   It's one software combined.
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.460]   The advantage of doing that is the software is always up to date.
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.380]   You don't have to worry about patches, security flaws.
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:03.820]   They always keep it up to date.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.540]   They really do have the best hosting.
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:09.140]   I think it has something to do with the tight coupling between the content management system
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:12.020]   and the server software.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:16.100]   We have tried and have failed time and time again to bring a square space site down.
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.260]   You just can't do it.
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.260]   Beautiful templates.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:26.060]   Listening from designer templates, you can customize to your heart's content.
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:28.940]   And again, you don't have to worry about the responsive design because for instance when
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:32.340]   you put an image in there it creates seven different sizes so that it always looks great
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.820]   on any screen.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:38.500]   Even when you change the column widths and so forth, all of that is automatically handled
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:43.380]   in the new templates for square space six so that everything looks great on all the different
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.460]   sizes.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:50.580]   You get of course the ability to use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JSON because it's state
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.060]   of the art but you don't have to even know what those terms mean to use a square space
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.060]   site.
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:16:00.740]   They've got by the way a great Cintex colored editor that pops out if you're a big CSS or
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.620]   a JavaScript user.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.260]   You can implore it from the existing, almost all the existing APIs so that your data goes
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:11.420]   right in including all of the links, all the images, all the comments even.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.420]   Export to, you're never trapped in a square space site.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:19.340]   And the ability to include things like Google Maps and Flickr and Twitter and Facebook and
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:25.460]   all that stuff with just little widgets means that your site will be a rich, vibrant place
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:26.460]   to visit.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:30.740]   I think square space is a great site, a great place to host your site whether it's a one
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:36.060]   off or a wedding or an anniversary or a birthday or your e-commerce site.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:40.500]   I want you to visit squarespace.com and as with all of our sponsors we really encourage
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:46.420]   this and I think it's a testimony to how confident they are in their product.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:49.900]   They offer you a free two week trial.
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.380]   You don't need to use a credit card or anything.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.980]   You just go to squarespace.com and click the get started button.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:17:00.380]   You can try it for two weeks if you decide you like it or you want to keep that site.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.660]   That's where we come in.
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.380]   They've got two plans now.
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.500]   They've really simplified this.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.180]   The basic plan and the unlimited plan.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:09.780]   Standard plan starts at $8 a month when purchased annually.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.340]   You can also get it $10 a month to month.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.500]   The unlimited plan is the one you should look at.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:21.860]   $16 a month, $16 a month for hosting and software with unlimited pages, galleries, blogs,
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.460]   unlimited bandwidth.
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:26.460]   They're not metering the bandwidth at all.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.900]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:32.980]   When you buy an annual plan they'll register the domain for you for free and they'll hook
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.940]   it up to your square space site for free.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.700]   All of that for $16 a month and now here's the good stuff.
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:43.180]   When you put in the offer code, "Twit 10," you could take 10% off that.
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:47.020]   If you get the annual plan you get the biggest savings.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.100]   Squarespace.com, use the offer code "Twit 10."
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.300]   You only need that when you buy it's free to try.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.020]   You'll save 10%.
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.300]   "Twit 10."
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.980]   If you're listening to this in November or December, it's the number.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.820]   It's "Twit" and then the number of the month.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.820]   "Twit 11" will work next month, "Twit 12" a month after like that.
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.820]   Then we start all over again.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:10.380]   Squarespace, the secret behind truly exceptional websites.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.620]   I've been using them for two years.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:15.020]   I haven't moved to six yet but I'm going to do it before the end of the year.
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:19.700]   It's a little tricky moving to six because you can't just take your template and move
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.700]   it over.
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.980]   Your content will move over but you really want to start with a new template so you get
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:23.980]   the responsive design.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:29.740]   Yeah, that's what I need to start with the new template and do that and tweak it a little
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:30.740]   bit.
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:32.700]   It's a great service.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:37.580]   Every time I've had a problem or wanted to tweak something, their responsiveness has
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:41.740]   been terrific and so, yeah, I have no problem recommending them.
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:47.820]   The fact that you can bring any of your data in and you can get it out at any time is very
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:51.420]   customer centric like that a lot too.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:57.820]   Just about an hour ago, CNBC reported that SoftBank, the big Japanese cell company,
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.540]   I think they're not number one in Japan, I think number three in Japan but they're a
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:06.940]   big company, has agreed to buy 70% of Sprint in the United States.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:09.540]   That's a $20 billion purchase.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.620]   The deal is expected to be announced tomorrow morning.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:14.740]   The boards of both companies have agreed to principle.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:24.500]   Of course, there'll be some regulatory hurdles that they have to jump.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:29.860]   The current price per share of Sprint is $5.73.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.260]   The tender is $7.30.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:36.340]   That's a good premium for Sprint shareholders.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:41.820]   Given the structure, it says it will not require a shareholder vote.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.340]   It's not a fire sale.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.340]   That's good money.
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:51.260]   It's not a fire sale, which is surprising.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.260]   They really failed.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.380]   They really tripped over YMAX.
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:58.940]   They could have done something so cool and they set out to do something so cool and they
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:08.420]   ran out of money and they also ran out of regulatory leverage to a certain degree because
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.820]   they were trying to get YMAX out.
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:17.520]   The thing that they were doing with YMAX was YMAX was YMAX was trying to unlock the strangle
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:26.540]   hold that the carriers have over mobile broadband in many ways.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:30.700]   At the same time they were doing that, they had to buy bandwidth.
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:35.540]   All these towers, you still have to buy backhaul to the towers.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:38.540]   They had to buy this stuff from a lot of their competitors.
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:44.260]   The ones who had the most to lose from what the way Sprint was going to roll out YMAX.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.420]   Ultimately, it failed.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.420]   They ran out of money.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:48.300]   They ran out of time and they had to sell.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.420]   I don't know that SoftBank.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:57.300]   It now has essentially an ancient network.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:02.380]   They do have a decent data network, but it's aging.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:04.220]   It's like, what do they really buy?
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:12.700]   The main thing that Sprint has is a massive amount of the airwaves, of the spectrum in
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:14.460]   the US.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:16.940]   That's what I think SoftBank is buying.
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:24.300]   It's the spectrum and not the assets of Sprint itself, which are of dubious value.
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.140]   YMAX has pretty much failed.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:28.460]   It's a declining asset.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.380]   Sprint CDMA network also declining asset.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:37.340]   All of the spectrum that they own in the US is more than most of the other carriers.
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:42.700]   I believe it's even more than Verizon if you go and you look at all of their spectrum assets.
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:46.780]   It is still a viable asset, but you're talking about a longer-term build-out if they're going
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:53.060]   to essentially shelve all the stuff that Sprint has already done and replace it with some
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:59.740]   kind of GSM LTE network based on SoftBank, which is certainly a possibility.
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.940]   Sprint is already replacing its YMAX 4G network.
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:07.180]   Sprint with the first national carrier in the US to have so-called 4G with YMAX.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:11.260]   I actually am a Sprint customer and I largely have it because of the unlimited data.
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:15.540]   I really like not having to look at a meter every time I download data, but the problem
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:20.260]   is living in the Bay Area where we don't have LTE, that data that I do get unlimited amounts
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.980]   of comes very slowly.
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:25.620]   So I'm still on 3G, but they are rolling out LTE nationally.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.720]   They're taking their time.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.980]   I think they're in about 20 markets right now.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:32.580]   They announced a hundred new markets this week, including, and the reason I know that
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:35.620]   is because Petaluma, where we are, is one of them.
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.740]   Are you actually online yet or are they in out for coming out?
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.460]   Well, the press release was interesting.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:45.500]   It didn't specify a date and they said, "But you may notice LTE soon and you can use it."
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.380]   But the official launch is in the future.
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.700]   So I don't have a Sprint LTE Sprint phone.
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:50.700]   So I have to-
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.700]   Well, I'll have to turn mine back on.
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.100]   Although I'm going to Argentina tomorrow where Sprint doesn't work.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.980]   I have to carry a GSM phone when I'm down there.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:01.260]   But up here, I have to turn on because sometimes it'll work and sometimes it'll don't.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.900]   But the point is that they're abandoning the YMAX.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:04.900]   They're moving over to LTE.
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:10.260]   So they're going to have the same type of network as AT&T and Verizon.
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:14.580]   And this is also interesting in light of the fact that T-Mobile is trying to acquire Metro
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.420]   PCS.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:19.900]   So that means we're now going to have four viable mobile phone companies.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:20.900]   That would be a good thing.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.340]   That'd be fantastic if we do.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:23.340]   Exactly.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.860]   The opposite would have looked like last year with the Deutsche Bank.
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:31.780]   I wonder if CDMA can actually be phased out and GSM phased in without any kind of regulatory
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.500]   hurdle from the FCC.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.860]   It's funny because you see Sprint customers overseas in England.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:40.220]   They're the ones looking at their phones going, "Why doesn't this work?"
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.220]   It's actually hard.
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:44.900]   Actually, they're lucky because if it did work, they'd be paying $3 a minute to use their
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:45.900]   phone.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:50.700]   Well, no, but even with a local SIM, I mean my last trip home, I came back from my last
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.700]   tour.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.700]   I got off the plane.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.180]   I had a shower at the Arrivals Lounge at the BA Lounge and I ran into Bill Nye the Science
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:56.180]   Guy.
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:57.740]   And I went up to him and I went, "You're Bill Nye the Science Guy.
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.940]   You're so awesome."
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:23:59.940]   And he said, "Are you American?"
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:00.940]   And I said, "I'm Canadian."
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.460]   He said, "Good enough.
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.700]   I've got a Sprint phone and it doesn't work.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.180]   Where do I rent a phone?"
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:10.740]   And I was like, "I don't know where you rent a phone into Heathrow."
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.740]   But you know what?
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:15.820]   I've just come back from Burning Man and I brought my old Nexus phone along as a camera.
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:16.820]   It's in my bag.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:18.340]   I'll reset it to factory defaults.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.340]   Here's my card.
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:20.340]   Mail it back to me when you're done.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.020]   So Bill Nye went around London with my phone.
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:23.020]   Can you guys see this?
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.460]   This is my bucket of phones.
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.460]   That's enough.
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:27.460]   Some of the GSN.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.620]   I'm going to go through this later tonight.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.820]   I'm going to pick out a couple to bring with me to Argentina.
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.380]   One of them sure to work.
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:39.740]   And I just went to my phone bucket to pull out my only Sprint phone, which is a Galaxy
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:40.740]   S2.
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.740]   I'm curious.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.140]   Maybe we are getting 4G.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:48.940]   The problem is a lot of these carriers, including AT&T, label HSPA+ and other phony things as
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:49.940]   4G.
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:53.980]   Clearwire, which is the YMAX that Sprint was using, was terrible.
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:25:00.820]   By the way, according to the CNBC report, Sprint's got 48% of Clearwire and needs to
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:04.780]   complete the purchase of Clearwire before this can go through.
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:11.060]   So it's expected that Sprint will soon announce the full acquisition of Clearwire.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:12.420]   I don't know why they want it.
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.420]   Why would they want it?
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:14.420]   That's all spectrum.
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:18.100]   It's not the technology, it's the frequencies.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.780]   No, it's air space.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.140]   That's like beachfront property.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.140]   Clearwire.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:28.420]   It's like an airline by another airline for the gate, rather than the planes, which is
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.900]   exactly why they buy them.
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:30.900]   Excellent metaphor.
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:34.780]   You know, the spectrum, Sprint owned a bunch of this spectrum.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.700]   They spun it off and they gave it to Clearwire.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:42.860]   Essentially when they spun off their 4G as Clearwire, they're just buying it back, right?
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:46.500]   When they're getting the spectrum, when they're buying Clearwire, they're just buying back
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.700]   all that spectrum because it's beachfront property.
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.700]   Got it.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:52.180]   This is like a telecoms version of an AquaHire.
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.180]   Right.
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.180]   That makes sense.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:59.100]   And I don't know, I was owned by Softbank, not me personally, but Ziff Davis was owned
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.020]   by Softbank briefly.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:05.420]   And I don't have great memories of it.
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:10.220]   But I mean, on the other hand, I don't have horrible memories of it either.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.860]   Well, I'm booting this up.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:13.500]   You know, it says 4G right here.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.500]   So that must be.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.860]   They wouldn't let them put it on a phone if it doesn't prove.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:20.420]   You know, none of this is actual 4G.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:21.420]   That's the other thing.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.060]   It's all a big fat lie.
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:29.020]   LTE is closest, but it's still not, you know, what the original specifications of
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:31.340]   4G were based on.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.100]   ITU, I love this.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.140]   It's in Wikipedia, so it's got to be true.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:40.140]   4G is nominally 100 megabits download.
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:42.540]   But the ITU made an exception in the US.
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:49.340]   They said, "Well, if it's a big improvement over your 3G network, you can call it 4G."
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:51.300]   So we don't have any of that.
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:52.300]   I don't know.
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.740]   Corey, who's your carrier in Great Britain?
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:27:00.620]   I use orange, and I'm not super thrilled with them, but they just, you know, I'm grandfathered
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:05.220]   into an unlimited data plan they unwisely offered 10 years ago.
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:10.820]   And so I'm going to stick with that until they, I don't know, somehow decide to violate
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:14.220]   their contract or go bankrupt or something.
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:17.860]   But I mean, you know, they're hilarious because orange, oh, hunch is a French company, but
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:23.220]   you go to France and they're like, yes, orange, orange France is not orange UK.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:28.060]   And you wouldn't believe the roaming rates orange France charges us here at orange UK.
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:29.740]   Honestly, there's nothing we can do about it.
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:34.460]   I mean, it's, you know, we're as shocked as you are that you're paying 8 pounds of megabyte
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:35.460]   in France.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.460]   8 pounds of megabyte.
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.460]   Wow.
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.100]   I mean, if you're low.
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:45.780]   I mean, anybody gets on a plane turn off data before the plane takes off because by the
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:48.980]   time it taxis to the terminal, you could be broke.
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.220]   I mean, it could be really devastating.
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:56.060]   I went to Russia with like 300 meg for the weekend plan.
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:02.420]   And I ran over it because the, they're bit counter lagged by like just a couple of minutes.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:06.820]   I ran over a couple of megs and the bill was something like 78 pounds.
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:07.820]   Oh, man.
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:08.820]   Oh, man.
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:10.900]   It's the best in South India, Russia.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.380]   Network runs over you.
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.380]   Yeah.
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:20.460]   What's the best UK temporary sim part in terms of mobile broadband?
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:21.460]   I got no idea.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:22.460]   Three.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:23.460]   Is agent is free.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:26.580]   I hear very good things about three Sarah language.
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:28.900]   She was in London for low web London.
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.700]   Got a three sim put it in.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:31.700]   It was very cheap.
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:32.700]   It included unlimited data.
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:33.700]   It was a great deal.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.700]   I can't remember what it costs.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:39.100]   And if anyone out there knows the best argentina plan, please at Larry Maggot on Twitter.
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:42.020]   I can use that information early tomorrow morning.
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:43.020]   This is big stuff.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:44.540]   Actually, I'm in London in three weeks.
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:46.020]   That's why I was asking, but it's big stuff.
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.820]   This is tech support for all of it.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.820]   You know what?
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.820]   It is.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:54.820]   If you got the iPhone 5 from Verizon with the unlocked sim card, you got the best international
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.660]   phone and it's from Verizon.
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:59.660]   Hey, do those little tiny sim cards, whatever they're called?
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:00.660]   The nano sims.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:03.260]   No, you have to cut the sim down.
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.420]   Somebody sending me a nano.
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.620]   Frazier's sending me a nano sim cutter.
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:09.260]   And that really is like a little guillotine.
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:13.780]   Well, the funny thing is it actually cuts some of the, you know, the context.
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:17.420]   Most of the sim is paper, but this actually the manana sim cuts the context and apparently
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:18.420]   still works.
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:19.420]   Those are extra.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.420]   I have those traces.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.420]   They don't do anything.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:25.020]   That's why he was break fluid and windshield wiper fluid in the same bucket.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:26.620]   It's all the same crap it off.
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.780]   You're a dying at just a market.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:30.420]   They screw you in and neither.
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.740]   Hey, as long as we're talking phones, I got, I, my, the cherram's going to hate me.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.660]   I got to talk about my galaxy note too.
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:38.420]   I love it.
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:40.020]   Do you like big phones, Corey?
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.020]   Giant.
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:42.220]   I got, I got the Nexus.
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:43.220]   I got the big galaxy.
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.220]   That's a nice phone.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:45.220]   Yeah, you said that.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.220]   That's a nice.
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.220]   It's a nice phone.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:51.380]   Actually, that's the same resolution as this, but this is five and a half inches.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:55.740]   I think this is the phone for old people like me because I can, and people with sausage
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.220]   fingers because I can type on it.
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:58.220]   I can see it.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.820]   I just, I'm so big.
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:03.620]   Do I look, does this phone make my head look small?
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:07.060]   You know, there's a British comedy sketch where a guy walks around with a phone that's
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:11.300]   like sort of the size of a big cat and he's got to look to the side of his head and he
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:15.660]   walks in and it's like a kind of like ambush comedy like he walks into places like banks
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.660]   and he says, "I'm on the phone!
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:18.660]   I can't hear you!
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:19.660]   I'm on the phone!"
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:23.180]   And he's got this phone that's literally like as big as a toddler.
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.660]   It's just not inside of his head.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:25.660]   It's really amazing.
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:26.660]   Nice.
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:27.660]   Nice.
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.980]   So, that's about what the galaxy note looks like.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:30.980]   I mean, it's, it's about that.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:31.980]   It's like a baguette.
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:32.980]   It's pretty close.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.380]   Remember, remember a few of you that were trying to make phones as small as they could?
[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.380]   Right.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:39.140]   Like, palm king or this teeny, teeny little phone?
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.540]   That was so, so 90s.
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.540]   That was in the 90s.
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:42.540]   Right.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:46.300]   So, instead of signing at a French science fiction convention next to this young French
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:50.980]   woman who'd published her first novel at 18 and I got a text and I took out, I had
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:55.700]   some big Nokia phone with like a Zeiss lens and it was giant and I took it out to answer
[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:57.700]   the text and she went, "Your phone!
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.260]   It's so big!"
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:02.300]   And then she took out a phone like the size of her fingernail and pulled out the antenna
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.620]   and went, "Hello!"
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:07.900]   I'm surprised with my little phone.
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:10.300]   It was really funny.
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:15.020]   I actually have the video of the giant phone.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:16.820]   It's Dom Jolly, or Jolie, right?
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.940]   That's the guy.
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:24.340]   Yeah, he apparently, you can watch this on the YouTube.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:29.500]   He's on a train with his giant phone.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:34.860]   I don't think my first cell phone, I think I had one about that size.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:36.860]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:37.860]   I want a train!
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.860]   A car thing!
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:44.860]   Yeah, no car tough, Tila, rid of Tano!
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:45.860]   In a tunnel!
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.860]   Hang on!
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.860]   Get me a nice price!
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:48.860]   I'm in a train!
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:57.860]   It's funny the first time, but I think he's recorded about 140 hours of that and there
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:58.860]   is content.
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:31:59.860]   It goes, it works, it always works.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.700]   It's, you can do no wrong.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.700]   Everybody hates cell phones.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.220]   That guy's going to send you a takedown notice tomorrow.
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.860]   Oh, I guarantee you.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:10.860]   You know, at this point, it's actually every week on Twitch.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.300]   And it's things like Brazilian TV.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:16.100]   And sometimes it's like for a year old episode, it's just weird.
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.660]   I get YouTube every day.
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.260]   I get a YouTube takedown notice.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:20.260]   Really?
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:24.380]   They're not enforcing their, attract three complaints, get booted off of YouTube forever.
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:27.500]   Let's talk about that AT&T says, "Six strikes and you're out."
[01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:35.020]   That's coming up in just a bit, but first let's see what we missed this week on Twitch.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.020]   This is Twitch.
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.020]   Tech News Today.
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:42.020]   I'm going to go out on a limb, Tom, and maybe, maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot here,
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:46.380]   but I'm going to say that it is no longer mythical.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:49.500]   Don't shoot yourself in the foot out on a limb, you'll fall.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.740]   Home Theater Geeks.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.700]   The tagline was perfect sound forever.
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:55.700]   I remember well.
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:56.700]   So...
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:02.700]   And I got to ask, if it was perfect sound, why do people not like it?
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.700]   The tech guy.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:04.700]   Phones are like purses.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:07.780]   You ever notice a woman never goes to a smaller purse?
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.100]   They only go to bigger purses and bigger and bigger.
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:12.860]   You escalate and phones are like that.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:16.580]   You start getting a big screen, then you can ever go to a smaller screen.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:17.580]   You got to go to bigger and...
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:18.580]   Gizwiz.
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:19.580]   Hey, come here.
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:20.580]   Give me a hug.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:21.580]   You crazy.
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.580]   You crazy either.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:24.740]   You just give me a big hug.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:25.740]   Come on.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:30.180]   Come to your daddy.
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:31.180]   Twitch.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.180]   We love you.
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:36.940]   That would be the segment they use in the...
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:37.940]   Best of episodes.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:40.860]   Those are some of the things you missed this week on Twitch.
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:43.740]   We do that because sometimes people watch this show and they don't know that there's
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:46.340]   actually other shows on the network.
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.540]   Some of them.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:52.100]   Samsung did unveil a mini Galaxy S3 now.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.500]   Speaking of bigger and smaller, it's a four inch Galaxy S3.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:59.260]   So now they have a 4.3, 4.8, and 5.5.
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:03.940]   This is basically a Galaxy S3 with a giant screen in Galaxy now.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:07.100]   Any size, but I think that that's their strategy, right?
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.340]   Is that it's basically the same phone across the board.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:15.780]   And Jelly Bean, which I have to say is a lot better Android operating system than...
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:21.180]   In fact, at this point, it's every bit as good as anything, anybody, including apples,
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:22.620]   every produced, and every bit is fast.
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.140]   It's very, very fast.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:28.380]   Notifications are amazing on that, by the way.
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:29.580]   I mean, that's kind of the killer.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:34.140]   I still believe that's the killer feature that Android has over iPhone.
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.020]   And they took it even further with Jelly Bean as the notifications.
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:38.020]   They're just so...
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.020]   So beautiful.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.740]   You know, so amazing.
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:41.740]   Yeah.
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.740]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.060]   You know, I think at this point, and I love the Samsung ads, where they basically they're
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:49.540]   saying, "You know, the iPhone's for your mom and dad."
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:50.540]   Yeah, they're funny.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.540]   Are you funny?
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:52.540]   Mom and...
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.500]   It's just at the end of the ad, it's just...
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.700]   Am I in line for the apps?
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:57.700]   Yes, Mom.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:35:01.180]   Is Apple going to sue Samsung for a 4-inch screen?
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.180]   Do they have a patent on that?
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.180]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:05.540]   No, because it's such a weird shaped 4-inch.
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:06.540]   It's so weird.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.540]   It's so weird.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.540]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.540]   It's tall.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:11.740]   Anyway, enough of that.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:17.020]   Can we talk about that outfit that you were wearing, Leo, and the clips that they had?
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.020]   What outfit?
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:19.020]   What are you talking about?
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.660]   Okay, just checking.
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:26.260]   Okay, so that's the GizWiz, which is our gadget, you know, kind of goofy gadget, if
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:27.260]   you show.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.340]   And on a crap I found on Sky Mall.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:30.340]   And...
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:31.340]   Yeah.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:35.020]   And so what we do is we pick some stuff from Sky Mall and we let the audience vote and each
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:37.180]   week I buy whatever they said I should buy.
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:42.180]   In this case, it was a tie-died union suit.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:43.460]   I threw in the hat.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:45.100]   That's a pork pie hat.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.980]   That's vintage.
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:47.980]   That's vintage.
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:51.380]   You know, it's remarkably comfortable.
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:54.820]   And it's ready to wear the plier.
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:57.540]   I have now a finally apply a costume.
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.060]   I'm ready for Burning Man.
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:03.340]   By the way, you're looking pretty trim and fit in that costume there, Leo.
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:04.340]   Nice thing around.
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.340]   That's not what Dr. Mom.
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:09.620]   I have a physician in the chat room who diagnoses me via chat.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:17.620]   She said, "No, you're going to lose weight."
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:18.620]   What were we going to talk about?
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:19.620]   I forgot.
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.620]   Oh, AT&T.
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:21.780]   Six strikes and you're out.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:26.980]   Now this is the three strikes law, the Hadoop law in France, I think has been overturned,
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:27.980]   right?
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:28.980]   No, no, Hadoopi.
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:29.980]   Hadoopi.
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:30.980]   This Microsoft's.
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:31.980]   That's talented.
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:36.660]   No, Hadoopi hasn't been overturned, but the new government is talking about doing something
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:37.660]   with it.
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:41.820]   But they've sent out a, like, a heptilian notice as threatening disconnection.
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:45.540]   The only person they've ever actually tried to enforce against was a guy who they admitted
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:46.900]   hadn't downloaded anything.
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:51.500]   His ex-wife had used his connection to download and they're like, "But under the law, you
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:52.500]   are responsible."
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:55.980]   So, they find him some euros, but they didn't disconnect him from the internet.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:02.580]   But in America, AT&T just leaked a memo that, that Tournfreek got that basically described
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:03.820]   what their regime is going to be.
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:08.060]   And that's if you get unsubstantiated copyright complaints after a couple of them, they take
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:13.780]   away your YouTube and your Facebook until you go to copyright re-education school.
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.620]   And then if you get six of them, they just disconnect you.
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:19.860]   And of course, AT&T is successfully lobbied in lots of places to prevent any kind of municipal
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:22.340]   Wi-Fi or anything that might compete with them.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:25.020]   And it looks like Sprint's 4G is not going anywhere.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:28.380]   So it's like a little Tomlin, "What are you going to do without us?
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:29.380]   We're the phone company.
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:31.900]   You're going to use two Tinkans in a string for your broadband."
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.180]   So yeah, it's pretty bad.
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:37.100]   I mean, it's pretty depraved.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:42.460]   I've been complaining I had some running with Comcast this week trying to get it installed.
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:43.460]   And they just serve it.
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.260]   It's so screwed up.
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:46.500]   But so I tweeted about it.
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.180]   And that boy, I tell you.
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:49.500]   They pay for some reason.
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:53.060]   You could talk about it like crazy on the radio, on the TV.
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:55.060]   But you tweet about it.
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:57.820]   So I've been getting calls from the Comcast executive.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:02.860]   The worst is this morning, 8 a.m., Sunday morning, 8 a.m., they wake me up.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:05.580]   And I'm thinking, "This is not what I call customer service.
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.020]   This is not what I'm looking for.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.260]   Go away!"
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:10.260]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.860]   These guys are out of control.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:12.860]   They're monopolists.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:16.460]   None of them understand customer service because they never had to.
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:20.180]   The thing about AT&T is really what they're saying because in that briefing to their own
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.580]   customers, it says, "What if someone says they didn't download anything?
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:24.580]   What should I tell them?"
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:28.260]   And the answer is, "You're responsible for anything anyone does on your shit."
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:31.580]   So what they're really saying is, although that's not a principle in law or anything,
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:32.580]   right?
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:36.020]   There's no contributory liability for leaving your Wi-Fi open.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:42.820]   But what they're saying is, if you live in the same house as someone who's got a router
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:48.660]   that is implicated in an unsubstantiated accusation of copyright infringement without
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:52.500]   the chance to examine the evidence against you or rebut it or face your accuser, you
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.060]   lose your internet access.
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:59.340]   Which means that you could have a child or a roommate who does something and you could
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:03.260]   lose your job, you could lose your ability to go to school because having internet access
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:06.260]   is not just for playing games.
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:08.140]   It's how I earn my livelihood.
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:12.700]   If they took away my internet access, they would be taking away my livelihood.
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:17.820]   And if you're one thing to do, if I did something illegal, but it could be a roommate doing it.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.700]   Well, and it includes mistakes, right?
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:26.540]   They accused a laser printer at a university of downloading an Indiana Jones movie once.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:30.900]   And if you have a rare disease and your support network is online, if you're from a diaspora
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:35.300]   population, the way you stay in touch with your family is over Skype, there's a million
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:38.380]   ways in which losing the internet costs you.
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:40.300]   Now, I just want to point this out.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:45.620]   This is from Torrent Freak and it is, we don't know of the provenance of this.
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.860]   Torrent Freak says this is an AT&T training document.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:51.820]   I don't know one way or the other if it is.
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:59.820]   AT&T said they would embrace a regime of six strikes and you're disconnected this year.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:03.020]   If this isn't the training document, then there's some other training document that
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:07.540]   it must be substantively similar about disconnection because they've agreed that they will disconnect
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:09.660]   along with all the other major carriers.
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:13.660]   Now, that's the issue is disconnect.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:18.460]   And my sense of the original proposal was it didn't involve disconnection, it involved
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:19.460]   reeducation.
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:25.180]   No, it was graduated, they call it graduated response where it starts with a stiff letter
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:29.500]   and then you have to go to reeducation school and then, I don't know, they come over and
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:33.860]   they punch your grandmother and then once you get to SAC.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:37.020]   But they did say that for six strikes, we will cut you off.
[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.340]   Yeah, we disconnect you.
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:41.540]   I just not sure we'll ever see this in the real world.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:46.340]   I mean, if AT&T were owned by Time Warner, right?
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.900]   At Time Warner, if this was Time Warner, I would totally buy it, right?
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.860]   Because they are incented because they're also in the content business.
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:53.860]   They're in the content business.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.500]   But everybody's in the content business.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.900]   Now Comcast owns NBC Universal.
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.180]   Yeah, but AT&T is not.
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:05.940]   AT&T makes all of their money by selling you more broadband than you need and overcharging
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.380]   you for as much as they can.
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.700]   And they're in the business of keeping customers.
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:13.020]   And so I don't know.
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:15.340]   Like I said, I don't think this would hold up in court.
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:19.540]   I think AT&T is economically incented to keep you as a customer.
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:23.700]   I mean, what court case would someone bring?
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.740]   I mean, I'm sure your contract says.
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:28.060]   OK, so then they are, yeah.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:33.060]   Obviously, if it was one of those two companies, I'd be--
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:34.100]   Jason, you're breaking up.
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:34.980]   I think that--
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:37.540]   I think Time Warner has something to say about this.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:38.020]   Yeah, right.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.500]   I just don't know what court case anyone would bring.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.580]   I mean, it's a contract thing, right?
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:43.820]   This is what your contract says.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:45.300]   It's your terms of use.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:50.220]   The problem is that if everybody else is doing it, AT&T is, I think, is going to look
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:50.580]   at that.
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:54.540]   And they're going to say lawmakers-- if we're the only ones who defect from this,
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:56.300]   lawmakers are going to come and clobber us.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:56.780]   Right.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:59.500]   Well, I don't know whether internet carriers are considered common carriers,
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:02.220]   but we do have protections when it comes to non-carriers.
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:02.580]   They're not.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:03.100]   They're not.
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:03.660]   Absolutely not.
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:06.220]   So it's just like any other contractual order.
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:10.100]   You don't have any rights to communications to access.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:10.860]   No.
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:11.860]   Well, we--
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.780]   Yeah, I'll just say they're economically
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:15.780]   incented to keep you as a customer, right?
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:21.980]   There's no AT&T isn't out there looking at a big bandwidth hog, right?
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:23.820]   Bandwidth hogs, they want to kick off the network.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:32.460]   I could see them saying you've been down a bunch of stuff that's pirated,
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:36.060]   and using that as a reason to say, let's get them work because they're using up
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:37.100]   a bunch of our bandwidth.
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:40.980]   I just can't see them incented in any way because of copyright infringement
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:43.260]   to try to kick you off.
[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:44.820]   Corey, is this a good time?
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:46.980]   And we were approaching an election in the United States.
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:48.340]   We're not only electing a president,
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:51.300]   but we're also electing members of Congress in many cases.
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:57.020]   Is this a good time to have a litmus test to call your member of Congress up
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:01.820]   for election or his or her opponent and say, what is your stance on a free and open
[01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:02.980]   internet?
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:03.220]   Sure.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.900]   I mean, this is right for the future, the folks who really spearhead
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:07.020]   at the anti-SOPA stuff.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:09.100]   They're running--
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:12.220]   get out the vote campaign that involves contacting your lawmaker
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.380]   and talking to them about how you feel--
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:17.620]   or contacting candidates and telling them how you feel about these issues.
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.140]   And I think in the wake of SOPA, there's
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:23.180]   some residual terror there in the halls of power
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:26.980]   that there is some kind of sleeping giant that's at least rolled over
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:31.260]   in its sleep, if not actually waking up last year, and that more might happen.
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:33.620]   I mean, it was pretty seismic last year.
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:36.580]   I was in DC a week before the SOPA hearing started.
[01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:41.260]   Every hillrat, every congressional aid I talked to was like, just give it up.
[01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:42.380]   They've got the signatures.
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:43.180]   It's done.
[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:43.860]   You lost.
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:44.660]   Forget about it.
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:49.180]   It directed Google with on board, though.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:50.620]   Every couple of years--
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:52.940]   Every couple of years we get a chance to really let them know.
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:56.260]   And I think this is a very good time for everybody who watches this show,
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:58.300]   who's a geek, to write your--
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:02.220]   as Corey calls them, your Congress critter, and let them know.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:05.220]   And especially if they're up for election, you might ask them that question.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:07.660]   How do you feel about the six strikes?
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:09.140]   All House members are up for election.
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:10.660]   They serve for two years.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:13.660]   All the House members and many senators.
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:14.020]   Yeah.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:14.660]   30 senators.
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:18.820]   This is an opportunity to do that right now.
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:20.700]   You're not going to get this opportunity for another two years.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.260]   Let's take advantage of it.
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:29.380]   There's more artists every year who are just showing that they don't need this kind of thing to thrive.
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:32.580]   I mean, I don't know if you saw the humble bundle that we launched last week,
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:33.300]   where we launched--
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.660]   You can't miss it if you go to crappound.com.
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:36.220]   There you go.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.180]   It's sitting right there.
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:37.780]   But I mean--
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.460]   What is the humble bundle?
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:43.340]   So it's like the humble indie bundles for games, the same people who run it.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:44.980]   I just volunteer for them.
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:49.380]   But they would gang up six games or eight games and say name your price,
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:50.820]   give some of it to charity.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:52.500]   We'll give you all these games.
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:55.140]   And the first one did over a million dollars.
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:58.620]   The most recent one did 4.7 million in the first week.
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:44:59.780]   It's a little two-week promotion.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:01.380]   So we're doing this with a bunch of books.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:07.020]   We've got Neil Gaiman, John Scalsy, Palabachi Galupi, Mercedes-Laki, Kelly Link,
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:09.580]   my new novel, Lauren Bukes.
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:10.660]   And you name your price.
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.220]   We've done over half a million dollars in like four or five days.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.300]   You name your own price.
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:15.500]   And some of it goes to charity.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.740]   You get to decide how much the charities are EFF, child's play,
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:21.740]   which gives games and toys to children's hospitals.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:24.380]   And the science fiction writers America emergency medical fund,
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:26.700]   which basically bails out writers who are going to lose everything
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:29.700]   because they got sick because they're freelancers.
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.460]   And it's a good cause.
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:31.980]   You get books.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:33.220]   There's no DRM.
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:34.380]   It's going good.
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:37.220]   And you get eBooks, three books.
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.860]   So we don't need six strikes.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:40.820]   We don't need three strikes.
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:41.860]   We don't need surveillance.
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:43.180]   We don't need DRM.
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:46.940]   You know, we treat our customers like we'd like to be treated
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.580]   and they come and give us half a million dollars.
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:49.460]   It's not bad.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:49.900]   Look at this.
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:51.940]   You could choose the amount-- I love this website.
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:53.020]   So you choose the amount.
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:55.740]   You could do a customer amount or anything for $15 to $100.
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:59.460]   And then there's a slider that says, how much goes to authors?
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:01.180]   How much goes to charity?
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:04.420]   How much goes is a humble tip to humble bundle?
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:07.780]   If you tip those arrows, you can choose how much per author, too.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:09.380]   So tip the little arrow next to the author.
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:11.860]   Oh, so you could vote for-- we should do this for Twit.
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:13.580]   Because people keep saying, how do we
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:15.220]   donate to individual shows?
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.620]   So Corey, Doctor, all the way-- oh, but then it--
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:19.620]   Zero to everybody else.
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:21.860]   Oh.
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:22.780]   I think--
[01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:23.780]   Let's make it a larger--
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.380]   It just shows that you can be nice and people will do it.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.580]   I mean, our top donor right now gave us $1,000.
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:29.180]   Wow.
[01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:29.940]   Isn't that neat?
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.380]   I do think this is the way for the future, actually.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:33.900]   And I think that-- actually, Corey, I
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:35.940]   think the way that you did it with your books,
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:40.340]   when your DRM free version of your books--
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:42.300]   I'm surprised more authors haven't done it, right?
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:43.940]   I mean, you even threw it out there.
[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:45.660]   If I remember right, then correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:48.340]   But you threw it out there for free and even said,
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:51.700]   if there are other formats, you guys submit your formats
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:54.500]   and we'll add them to the list of download.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.260]   And it obviously didn't work as--
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:58.780]   it didn't hurt your revenue.
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:02.420]   It actually helped spread the word about your product
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:05.220]   further and wider and get in the hands of more people,
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:08.180]   created more fans, and then created
[01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:12.180]   more of a viable product and a viable brand for you.
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:13.180]   So right?
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.620]   And it's not like I can stop you from copying.
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:17.100]   If you want, yeah, that's exactly what I did.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.380]   But it's not like I can stop you from copying if I want, right?
[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:21.700]   There's no magic way I can get the food coloring out
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.820]   of the swimming pool, right?
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:23.380]   It's a book.
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:25.500]   It's like 80K.
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:26.820]   You can copy it in a second.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:30.820]   So the only thing I can do is convince you to pay for it
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.900]   and not coerce you.
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:37.260]   Well, I just bought your book $100 to humble bundle.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.260]   Good for you.
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:39.260]   Yeah.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:40.580]   Is this an all-of-a-furred way to sell your book, Corey?
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:41.780]   Is this how you'd like to sell it?
[01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:42.940]   I don't know how many preferred ways.
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:43.940]   I mean, it's all the same.
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:44.460]   Hey.
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:46.780]   So I just get a story about Bookshare.org,
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:49.820]   which is a Palo Alto organization that provides free meat
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:53.260]   reading material to blind and physically disabled people who
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:54.780]   have trouble with regular books.
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:56.580]   And the biggest problem that they have
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:57.900]   is digital rights management.
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:00.500]   Because once you have a DRM-free book,
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.100]   you can make it big screen.
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:03.660]   You can make an audio version.
[01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:06.220]   You can actually make it useful to a person who
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:07.540]   has a physical disability.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:10.620]   But with DRM, it's actually making their work harder.
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:14.780]   So ironically, even though they have a license to get free books,
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:18.580]   they're pushing for a DRM-free version going forward
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:21.820]   in the hopes that it will no longer be necessary to have
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:25.020]   to carve out exceptions to the copyright law
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:26.900]   for people with disabilities.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.340]   And my publisher, Tor Books, has announced
[01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:32.500]   that all of its books are DRM-free and all of its science
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:33.660]   fiction and prints around the world.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:34.740]   You listen everywhere.
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:37.100]   Largest science fiction publisher in the world.
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:37.580]   I love this.
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:43.700]   Will Wheaton spent $242, not Will Wheaton spent $242,
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:47.820]   and Will Wheaton's clown sweaters spent $242.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:48.260]   Yes.
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:50.540]   So you got a big fan with Will Wheaton.
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:52.540]   Well, I mean, I think the other two are not Will.
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:54.660]   I think the other two are just people who follow Will
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:59.900]   around on behalf of his sweater and donate money.
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:00.860]   But wait a minute, Corey.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:03.300]   It's odd that they all gave the same amount.
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:05.220]   Well, I think they did it so they could bracket him
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:06.020]   on the leaderboard.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:06.620]   Oh, they did.
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:07.580]   One was a little more.
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:09.020]   One was a little less.
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:09.420]   That's right.
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:10.660]   One gave one penny more.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:11.540]   One gave one penny less.
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:13.060]   That's bizarre.
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:15.140]   Back at him on the leaderboard just to be--
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.300]   So they could be next to their friend.
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.900]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:19.380]   Wow.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:20.220]   That is neat.
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:23.260]   Obviously, I didn't spend enough to make it to the leaderboard.
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:24.180]   I'm going to have to--
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:25.420]   You can go and add more money.
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:27.700]   I'm going to have to revise my contribution.
[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:30.700]   And then you can get it in PDF, Moby, or EPUB.
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.260]   That's right.
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.140]   Awesome.
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:32.620]   Awesome.
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:33.100]   Yeah.
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:34.900]   All these books I just got.
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:38.060]   And the humble folks, there are 501(c)(3).
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:39.980]   They're a nonprofit.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:43.220]   They only do it because they want to make it better for people
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:46.900]   who make media to directly reach their audiences
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.540]   without having to be jerks.
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:49.180]   Neat.
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:52.460]   Oh, and it makes it even easier to send it to your Kindle.
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:54.580]   They just give you the whole thing right there.
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:55.780]   That's awesome.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.380]   Well, Leo, you've done this to a degree, too, right?
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:00.180]   You said you weren't going to take a salary.
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:02.060]   You were only going to go on the tips that you had.
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:02.980]   Yeah, it didn't work yet.
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:03.980]   So well.
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:04.580]   It didn't work.
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:05.080]   OK.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:05.900]   All right.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:07.060]   No, we do.
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.900]   What happened was it was just complicated.
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.980]   So we just put it in the general fund.
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:15.580]   But I take a salary roughly equal to that times 5.
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:16.340]   And then--
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:18.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:20.500]   And then what we've done lately is we just
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:24.740]   sold some t-shirts to raise money for an elemental stuff.
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:25.820]   We're not giving it to charity.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:26.540]   I'm the charity.
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:30.660]   But I got to make a living.
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:31.300]   Yeah.
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:32.340]   You're living in California.
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:33.180]   It's expensive.
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:35.980]   And then I spend the money on things like the Humble Bundle.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:36.980]   You see?
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:38.380]   Humble Bundle.com.
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.580]   It's the trickle-down theory.
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:40.260]   It's trickle-down.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:41.500]   Make me rich.
[01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:42.100]   That's right.
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:42.700]   Not promised.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:43.620]   You're going to be 53%.
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:47.260]   I'll give a small percentage to worthy charities.
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:50.940]   But when you take a tax or anything, you pay much taxes.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.340]   I pay more than 40%.
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:54.420]   I don't-- I'm no 14%er.
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:54.940]   OK.
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:57.180]   All right.
[01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:00.140]   I am giving much of my money to the federal and state
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.140]   governments in this fine land of ours.
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:03.140]   California.
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:05.740]   California is more than 9% now.
[01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:06.420]   No, I know.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.980]   I did my taxes yesterday, actually.
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:09.980]   I can see the California piece.
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:12.660]   As they cut the federal budget, the states
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:14.460]   start taxing you more.
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.180]   You pay one of the--
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:17.380]   I pay double tax on that because there's no tax relief
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:18.260]   if you live in the UK.
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:20.220]   So I pay tax on it and can't bring in.
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:23.460]   But you don't have to pay for health insurance in the UK.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.260]   That's true.
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:24.780]   That's true.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:26.220]   Well, I do through my taxes.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:26.860]   But yes.
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:28.060]   Well, that's OK.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:29.060]   That's right.
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:29.500]   That's right.
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:32.260]   Hey, I'm excited about the new Boxy TV for cord cutters.
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:32.940]   This is awesome.
[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:35.260]   An HDTV antenna and a DVR.
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:36.180]   This was leaked.
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:37.300]   But I think it's true.
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:40.460]   And I know people are talking about it.
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:45.660]   So this is a Boxy box that you add your own storage to.
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:48.300]   And it will do DVR.
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:53.060]   And if you live near an HDTV signal, who needs the cable?
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:55.740]   Very, very cool.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:58.260]   Leo, did you see that there are two new sling boxes came out
[01:51:58.260 --> 01:51:58.780]   this week?
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:51:59.300]   I did.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:00.500]   Does anybody care?
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:01.820]   I care.
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:02.380]   I care.
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:04.380]   Yeah, because they're a sponsor.
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:05.420]   Oh, excuse me.
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:06.780]   Shut up.
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:08.420]   I care a lot.
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:11.020]   So the question is, I mean, but it's a really interesting question.
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:15.420]   How important is it to get that access to your broadcast
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:16.740]   versus over the top anyway?
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:17.940]   I think you still need it.
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:21.260]   But and especially if you are paying for cable, what it does
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:23.100]   is it gives you what you really want.
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:25.860]   And someday we'll all have, which is any of our content
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.740]   anytime, anywhere, in any form, on any device.
[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:30.380]   And it's really good when you're out of the country.
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:32.420]   So for example, Corey, from the UK,
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:36.100]   if you had a sling box perched in someone's house here in the US,
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:39.100]   you could actually watch US content if you wanted to.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:39.740]   But I agree with you.
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:40.780]   I dream of a day--
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:42.620]   I don't like TV, but yes.
[01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:46.740]   I dream of a day where a sling box won't be needed.
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:49.980]   Someday the children can play in green fields,
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.940]   and there will no be no need for a sling box.
[01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:53.580]   And Big Bird will be roaming free.
[01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:54.340]   That's right.
[01:52:54.340 --> 01:52:57.140]   But until that day, we still need a sling box.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:59.540]   All right.
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:52:59.940]   You know what?
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.380]   Let me do a last commercial here,
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:04.420]   and we can wrap it up pretty quick.
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:06.380]   There's a few more stories.
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.420]   But I want to ask you about your singularity novel,
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:09.380]   too, Corey.
[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:11.100]   I don't want to forget that.
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:14.100]   But first, a quick word from a nice Canadian company,
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:16.060]   just like you.
[01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:18.460]   It's from up Ontario way, up your way.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:20.860]   It's called Fresh Books.
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:23.620]   This is one of the first web 2.0 services I ever used.
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:26.220]   Amber MacArthur introduced me to this in 2004.
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:28.740]   Because I was moaning and groaning about the fact
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:30.100]   that I had to invoice clients.
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.660]   I hated the end of the month.
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:33.340]   I never wanted to do invoices.
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:33.900]   But you know what?
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.700]   I found out an interesting lesson.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:36.820]   You don't invoice.
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:38.140]   You don't get paid.
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:42.060]   In fact, I think the day that she told me about Fresh Books
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:44.700]   was the day I said, I forgot to invoice Rogers, who
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:46.780]   was paying for the TV show for like six months,
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:48.660]   and they said, well, we're not going to--
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.220]   that's six months ago.
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:52.140]   You want us to pay you now?
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:53.300]   So I realized, you know, I really
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:56.020]   should probably get these out in a more pronto fashion.
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.780]   Fresh Books was the solution.
[01:53:57.780 --> 01:53:58.540]   It's awesome.
[01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:00.300]   Cloud accounting.
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:02.100]   Five million people use Fresh Books
[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:05.060]   to make billing completely painless.
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:09.420]   It's so much easier to get paid with freshbooks.com.
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:11.940]   They have a new iPhone app that will track expenses,
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:14.180]   turn hours into invoices on the go.
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:15.780]   You can actually do almost anything
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:18.820]   you could do on Fresh Books on the new iPhone app.
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:20.060]   Create invoices easily.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:21.020]   Email the clients.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:22.380]   Clients love them because not only can they
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:24.460]   view the invoices online, they could pay you on the spot
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:28.460]   with a credit card, PayPal, one of the online authorization
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:32.860]   systems, time sheets automatically become invoices,
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:34.860]   and your account and will love you around tax time
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:37.180]   because you get all the important stuff to them
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:39.220]   in a form and fashion they can use,
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:42.940]   even automated late payment reminders for those few clients
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:45.100]   who just don't pay right away.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:48.380]   And of course, as with all Canadian companies,
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:51.460]   you can call or email Fresh Books and get a live person
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:52.700]   and they will respond instantly.
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:53.980]   I don't know what it is about Canada,
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:57.260]   but customer service spot on.
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:58.100]   I think it's because--
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:58.940]   - Oh yeah, eh?
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:00.980]   - They're nice, they're nice people,
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:02.460]   and they just wanna help you.
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:05.500]   If you wanna send physical invoices,
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:06.340]   they can do that too.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.460]   They'll print them for an additional fee.
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:09.260]   Print them, stamp them and mail them.

[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:33.900]   Started using it eight years ago.
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:35.140]   - Wow.
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:36.060]   - Freshbooks.
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:37.740]   - That's my biggest problem with the writer
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:38.820]   is I forget to say it.
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:39.660]   - It's horrible.
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:41.180]   - I'm really good about getting my articles in,
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:43.100]   really bad about getting my invoices in.
[01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:44.100]   - It's the worst thing.
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.620]   It's why I'm glad I'm no longer a freelancer.
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:49.020]   Thank goodness. - Yeah.
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:50.740]   - I work for myself.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.340]   I don't invoice myself, however.
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:54.140]   So I never get paid.
[01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:58.140]   - So Corey, tell me, tell me, what is it called?
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:55:58.980]   The book you wrote?
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:55:59.980]   - Rapture of the nerds.
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:01.940]   - Rapture of the nerds.
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:03.700]   - Well, we'd written a couple of novellas over the years
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:06.100]   that have been very widely read and reprinted
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:08.540]   called jury service and appeals court.
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:11.260]   And our publisher asked us to write a third one
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:12.940]   that was as long as the first two put together
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.660]   and then some called parole board.
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:16.820]   And they were published with a complete rewrite
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:18.780]   as one volume called Rapture of the nerds.
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:22.700]   And it's basically a kind of mad cap rush
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:25.220]   through a world where the singularity has already happened.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:27.660]   And the only people left behind on the planet
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:29.620]   are people who didn't wanna upload their minds
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:30.540]   for one reason or another.
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:32.260]   Either they have deeply held religious beliefs
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:35.620]   or their technophobes or deep greens
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:37.060]   or they're skeptical about this whole thing
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:39.060]   about having their top of their head sliced off
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:42.260]   and their brain destructively scanned
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:43.540]   and uploaded to the cloud.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:46.900]   So periodically the cloud of post humanity
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:48.980]   sends sort of get evolved quick schemes
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:51.220]   to Earth via the RF spectrum
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:54.220]   and various people who should know better download them
[01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:55.740]   and try to instantiate them on Earth.
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:57.020]   And when they do and they get caught,
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:59.780]   there's a tech jury that meets in Libya
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:01.420]   and to evaluate their technology.
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:04.540]   And so Hugh is a kind of deep green Welsh potter
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:08.660]   who hates the singularity as parents have both ascended
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:09.780]   and he resents them.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:14.780]   And he's called to tech jury in Libya
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:17.820]   where he's infected with alien technology
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:20.380]   and sort of the rest unfolds from there
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:21.700]   through the next two volumes.
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:23.660]   And there's surprise appearances
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:28.660]   by various famous philosophers and so on and so forth.
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:34.100]   There's a great scene where he's sitting in his pottery
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:36.460]   and working on a pot and there's a thump at the door
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:37.300]   and he says, "Who is it?"
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:39.820]   And this booming voice says, "It's the singularity."
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:40.820]   And he says, "What do you want?"
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:42.380]   He says, "Everything is different now."
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:44.660]   And he says, "I don't want any."
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:45.500]   I love it.
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:46.980]   That sounds great.
[01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:48.340]   Charlie's a very funny guy.
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:50.420]   So writing this book with him was hilarious.
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:53.540]   Rapture of the nerds, available in craphound.com
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:54.540]   and everywhere else.
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:55.780]   And from Tor Books, yeah.
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:56.620]   Tor Books.
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.060]   Tor Books is a great publisher.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:57:58.900]   It's a great site.
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:57:59.740]   They're awesome.
[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:01.460]   So I think because you're in Britain,
[01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:04.620]   you're probably more aware of this Gary McKinnon story
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:06.940]   than we are here in the States.
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:09.060]   Gary McKinnon, a British computer hacker,
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.460]   on Tuesday will learn his fate.
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:12.060]   He's been fighting for 10 years
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:15.260]   against US extradition for hacking the Pentagon.
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:20.460]   On Tuesday, the home secretary will announce her decision
[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.700]   to Parliament on whether McKinnon will be extradited.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:27.020]   Why is there controversy on this?
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:30.060]   - Well, you know, he's this autistic spectrum guy
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:33.820]   who has trouble functioning in outside society.
[01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:37.980]   He basically probed an American military server,
[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:39.780]   reported a security vulnerability,
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.500]   didn't do anything bad.
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:44.620]   He's basically being extradited as a kind of terrorist.
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:46.900]   And there's, you know, I think legitimate fear
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:49.060]   that he's gonna end up in kind of Bradley Manningville
[01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:51.100]   in a kind of, you know, solitary confinement,
[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:55.140]   naked and freaked out kind of indefinitely.
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:58.220]   And so yeah, Brits are pretty worried about it.
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:00.460]   It seems pretty clear that what he did
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:03.420]   was not the kind of thing that actually
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:04.860]   was done with any sort of malice
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:06.940]   and presented any kind of risk.
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:08.700]   It was just against the rules.
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:13.620]   And the, I think it's pretty, I would bet
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:15.020]   that he's gonna end up being extradited.
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:18.220]   I don't think the Tories are likely to keep him in Britain.
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:19.700]   - That's kind of sad.
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:21.580]   - They're gonna send him off.
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:22.420]   - Yeah.
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:24.420]   - I mean, there's a reason they call them the nasty party.
[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:28.660]   - What is the view in the UK of the US
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:31.560]   are kind of attitude towards homeland security?
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:37.620]   It sounds like the Brits are somewhat afraid of it.
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:39.060]   - Well, it's not unitary, right?
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.460]   I mean, it's spread it across the side.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:42.380]   We are the country with--
[01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:43.540]   - You've got more cameras.
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:44.580]   - For TVs per red blood cell.
[01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:45.420]   - Yeah.
[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:49.420]   So it's on the one hand, I think there's this sense,
[01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:50.860]   oh, you know, the Americans are mad,
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:52.940]   they fingerprint you when you come into the country.
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:56.380]   And on the other hand, you know,
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:59.740]   we kind of lead America in things like network surveillance
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:04.740]   and CCTVs and we were, we actually rescinded habeas corpus,
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:07.180]   right?
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:08.380]   - Yeah, and the Magna Cartables.
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:09.980]   - Hey, so do we, you know, what the hell?
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.260]   - You know, but they can actually like hold you,
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:13.460]   I think it was for 14 days.
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:15.100]   Eventually they kind of, I think they backed off in it,
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.500]   but they could hold you for 14 days without trial.
[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.860]   You know, we don't have a First Amendment,
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:22.820]   so there's lots of people who get busted
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:25.780]   for very weird things like making jokes on Twitter about--
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:26.620]   - Yes.
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:27.460]   - You know, we talked about that last week.
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:28.300]   - Yeah.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:29.140]   - And stuff.
[02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:29.980]   - Yeah.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.100]   - So, you know, I think that that
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:34.860]   Britain's who are moderately self aware understand
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:37.020]   that they are living in a very glassy house
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:39.300]   and that there's no, they have no business telling Americans
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.420]   that they've gone security mad
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:43.660]   when Britain's gone, justice security mad.
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.780]   And I think that there's a sizable portion of Britain's
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.220]   who seem to vote for this stuff
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:51.740]   and who, for whom, you know, a security puppet show
[02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:54.500]   is just as good as security and, you know,
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:58.540]   bulk surveillance just keeps the bastards from misbehaving.
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:00.580]   And, you know, it's rather pity, I think,
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:02.220]   to use a British phrase.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:04.100]   - And yet there's clearly mistrust of the US
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:05.820]   and what we might do with Gary.
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:08.100]   - Sure, although, you know, there's the special relationship.
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:09.780]   I think when it comes to a head is when,
[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:11.660]   you remember the people who tweeted
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.380]   that they were coming to New York to--
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:14.900]   - Dig up Marilyn Monroe.
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.060]   - LA, yeah, they're gonna dig up Marilyn Monroe's group.
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:18.340]   It was clearly just hyperbole.
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:20.260]   I mean, it was tasteless, but it was like no more tasteless.
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:21.100]   - It was a joke.
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.380]   - Yeah, it was, you know, I mean, they say sillier things
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:24.820]   in American pie movies, right?
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:25.660]   - Right.
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:27.660]   - And yet they were turned back.
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:29.340]   And I think at that point, you know,
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:31.260]   notwithstanding the nodding of airport incident,
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:34.020]   a lot of people were like, seriously, really?
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:35.180]   Like, you can't tell the difference
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:37.740]   between an actual terrorist and someone who says,
[02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:39.820]   I'm coming to get so loaded in LA
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:42.300]   that I'm gonna end up digging up Marilyn's grave.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:44.620]   Like, because if you can't tell the difference
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:47.220]   between those things, I think you're doomed, right?
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:48.060]   - Yeah.
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:49.580]   - Because, you know, you're gonna spend a lot of time
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:52.020]   chasing drunk people and you're gonna be so busy,
[02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:53.700]   you're gonna miss the guy planning to blow up
[02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:54.540]   something for real.
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:55.380]   - Right.
[02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:58.700]   - But again, we're the ones who chased this guy, you know,
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:00.740]   who said, oh, if my girlfriend's late coming
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.580]   into nodding of airport again next week,
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:03.820]   I'm gonna blow the place up.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:07.820]   And a tweet that nobody saw until weeks later,
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.940]   and then, you know, nobody took seriously,
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:12.540]   but some prosecutor decided they should do something about it.
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:14.060]   - He won his case though, just recently.
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:15.540]   - He did, eventually years.
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:18.420]   I mean, he lost his job, his life was destroyed.
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:20.420]   The state, he didn't win his case because the government
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:23.180]   were like, you know, you're right, that was just dumb of us.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:25.300]   He won the case because eventually it got to a judge
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:27.300]   who said, really, really?
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:29.700]   No, you know, sorry.
[02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:31.220]   - You're gonna love this, Nathan Mirvold,
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:35.100]   former Microsoft CTO and world renowned patent troll,
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:39.220]   has just patented DRM for 3D objects.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:40.060]   - No.
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:45.060]   - He's very worried, as I think all right-minded people are,
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:47.900]   that people with a maker bought might just, I don't know,
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:50.580]   make something that's patented.
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:54.380]   So he's got a patent Tuesday from the USPTO,
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:56.540]   Manufacturing Control System,
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:00.420]   describes methods for managing object production rights,
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:02.700]   DRM for 3D printers.
[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:06.980]   - I call prior art, 'cause this appeared in my short story,
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.220]   theme punks, which became my novel makers
[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:12.860]   and was serialized on Salon, that's a 2008.
[02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:14.700]   - This must be depressing, the world is coming true.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.820]   - I'm pretty sure it was serialized on Salon in 2007.
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:18.940]   So I call prior art.
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:23.380]   - The dystopia you imagined in 2007 is becoming real.
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:24.820]   Corey, great to have you.
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:26.420]   - Nostradamus to predict it, right?
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:28.620]   - So great to have you.
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:30.100]   Let's actually, before we wrap up,
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:31.820]   let's say hello to Tom Merifina,
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:33.100]   what's coming up in the week ahead,
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:37.220]   what stories we'll be covering on TNT, Tech News today, Tom.
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:38.660]   - Hey, thanks Leo, here's a look at some of the things
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:40.500]   we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead
[02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:41.540]   for Tech News today.
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:44.660]   On Monday, October 15th, Pubcon starts and runs
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:46.820]   through the 18th in loss of Vegas, Nevada.
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:50.300]   Tuesday, October 16th, IBM has their earnings
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:52.820]   and TwilioCon takes place.
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:55.740]   Wednesday, October 17th, eBay has their earnings call
[02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:59.140]   and Google Wallet is set to phase out its prepaid card.
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:01.700]   That's the cutoff date, so use it up.
[02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:04.340]   Also, the Dublin Web Summit takes place that day
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:06.660]   and it's IMDB's birthday.
[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:10.180]   Thursday, October 18th, it's earnings, Palooza,
[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:12.900]   Microsoft, Nokia, Google and Verizon
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:14.580]   all set to announce their earnings
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:17.020]   and it's the Nintendo NES's birthday.
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:18.700]   Finally, Friday, October 19th,
[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:22.420]   and anyone buying Office 2010 or Office for Mac 2011
[02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:24.900]   will also qualify for an upgrade
[02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:27.500]   to the equivalent version of Office 2013,
[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:29.580]   starting on Friday, October 19th.
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.140]   That's a look at the week ahead, back to you, Leo.
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:33.020]   - And I just bought Office 2010.
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:33.900]   Darn it!
[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:37.220]   No, just kidding, just kidding.
[02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:39.700]   Corey Doctorowza, of course, one of the founding editors
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:42.540]   of Boing Boing Boing Boing.net is a great site
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:46.060]   for wonderful things and we love it very much.
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:47.460]   We're always eternally grateful.
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:49.740]   Of course, his books are just taken off.
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:51.100]   You can't stop writing them.
[02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:54.180]   You can find out more at his own website, craphound.com
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:56.820]   and absolutely pick up a copy.
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:04:59.220]   It's a young adult, right?
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:01.060]   - Yeah, I'd say, you know, sort of 13 and up
[02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:04.060]   or 11 and up if you've got a really precocious young person.
[02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:07.380]   - If you want to radicalize your teenager,
[02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:11.420]   do so now with cinema pirates available everywhere.
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:13.220]   Thank you, Corey. - I'll put up bail for him.
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:14.060]   (laughing)
[02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:15.020]   It's really great to have you on.
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:16.860]   Pirate cinema, I've reversed this.
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:18.500]   I'm dyslexic, pirate cinema.
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:21.540]   Thank you, Corey, good to have you.
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.500]   - Thank you, Leo. - Jason Heiner is the man
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:26.220]   in charge of tech, republictechrepublic.com.
[02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:30.100]   It's a great place to get an analysis of tech news,
[02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:35.100]   particularly with regard to kind of enterprise, right?
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:40.100]   - Yeah, so I write for tech republic, Znet and CNET as well.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:42.780]   So writing about tech republic and Znet
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:44.620]   are mostly the business of technology
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:47.660]   and CNET is consumer technology.
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:50.220]   So you can find me on all three.
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:51.460]   - It's great to have you again, Jason.
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:52.660]   Thank you so much.
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:53.900]   I appreciate it. - Oh, it's a pleasure.
[02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:56.300]   You helped me get elected president of the internet
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:58.420]   and I'm very grateful, but I understand somebody else
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:00.660]   is running now that guy from Reddit.
[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:02.900]   So go ahead, he can have a job.
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:05.580]   - No, it's a lifetime term. - It's a lifetime term.
[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:06.660]   - It's a lifetime term. - Is it?
[02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:09.300]   All right, take that, Alex O'Hanean.
[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:11.860]   And we thank Larry Maggett from CBS Radio.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:14.300]   It's great to have you, Larrysworld.com,
[02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:15.780]   a great site, a good place to find out
[02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:18.500]   how to set your privacy on iOS 6,
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:20.020]   'cause it's not where you think it is.
[02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:21.340]   Thank you, Larry, for being here.
[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.460]   - It's really a pleasure, Leo.
[02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:23.940]   - Thanks a lot. - It's great to meet you
[02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:25.420]   other guys too. - Yeah.
[02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:27.940]   I got a baseball game to go to or watch.
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:29.020]   - Oh, baseball. - Yeah.
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:30.660]   I think the Giants are playing.
[02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:31.900]   I'm excited.
[02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:33.060]   But thank you all for being here.
[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:34.540]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon,
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:38.620]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time on twit.tv.
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:41.140]   You can watch live, we love it if you do, but if you can't,
[02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:42.700]   of course we'll make audio and video versions
[02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:44.140]   available on demand after the fact.
[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:46.580]   On the website, twit.tv or wherever,
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:49.700]   find podcasts are aggregated.
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:51.100]   We do hope.
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:55.940]   We do hope you will make it a regular visit to the twit network.
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:57.580]   Thanks to our producer, Joe Johnson.
[02:06:57.580 --> 02:06:58.540]   Thank you, Corey.
[02:06:58.540 --> 02:06:59.500]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:00.540]   Thank you, Larry.
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:01.860]   Thank you for being here.
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:02.780]   Another twit.
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:04.580]   - This is amazing. - Is in the can.
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:07.160]   (upbeat music)
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:08.420]   (laughing)
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:09.820]   - Do it in the twit, all right.
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:11.740]   Do it in the twit, baby.
