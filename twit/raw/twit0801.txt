[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.360]   at a home goods and I was like what is this untitled goose doing in a home
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.960]   goods so you got some paint and I painted him to look exactly and I bought him a
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.520]   little a little neck ribbon like you can do the game it's very fun a tiny
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.840]   crown oh it's untitled goose game it brought to life yeah it's nice to see you
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.960]   Ashley also nice to see rich tomorrow KTLA's rich on tech haven't seen you in
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.040]   in an age normally you'd be you'd be taken over for me on the radio show but
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.880]   no one's going nowhere so I'm glad we could get you on the Twitch show instead
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.520]   yeah thanks for having me it's been fun I missed my trips up to a pedal Uma I
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.640]   know once or twice a year miss having you here that's all right the log in still
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.320]   on my computer anytime you need to use I like that touch I never actually used
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.080]   it oh by the way oh when it was there I never we never logged in a picture of
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.240]   you on it this is for rich it's like leaving Santa cookies you know you got
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.640]   to take one bite just let me know you did it that's all and somebody who hasn't
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.920]   been on our show in years it's weird because a week ago on the radio show I
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.080]   mentioned David Pogue and the missing manual somebody was looking for some
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.640]   information I said oh Dave's got great books and then minutes like an hour later
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.080]   I get a DM David Pogue is here it's so great to have you David thank you very
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.160]   much I I try to appear on your show once every 400 episodes so I was I was
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.360]   aiming for a number 800 last just missed it just missed it 801 this week
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.800]   David used to be the of course well David used to be a lot of things used to
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.280]   be a musical theater composer used to be at the New York Times their tech
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.080]   reporter you wrote the missing manuals but I understand that's not that's the
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.360]   end of that one that is true my missing manuals on iPhone Mac and Windows are
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.640]   no more or Riley is going to keep up with some of them some of the missing
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.960]   manuals from other authors but they said that you know people just aren't buying
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.680]   textbooks anymore they all all these young people today get their information
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.400]   from YouTube and Google so that's right my wife said well why don't you pitch the
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.800]   same exact thing is willing to invest so so I'm happy to announce right here on
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.520]   live Twitter my new series the unlocked series the first one shipping now Mac
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.600]   unlocked and then the iPhone one comes out in a couple of weeks you also did
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.160]   which I really enjoyed the basics Pogue's basics series and those were a lot of
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.040]   fun but I'm really looking forward to your next book couple of months ago I
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.360]   went through a phase where I thought I should prepare for climate change because
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.520]   it doesn't look like we're gonna do anything in time so I really should
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   figure out you know what I'm gonna do in the next 30 years but you actually
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.880]   have written the book that one must read it sounds like when does this come out
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.280]   oh man you you put put your fun finger on the nail this is my magma
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.480]   two years I spent working on this it's how to prepare for climate change it's
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   where to live how to invest how to ensure how to talk to your kids and then you
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.920]   know how to survive flood wildfire drought 20 years and stuff how do you
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.680]   come out in January kids you know you know you have my plugging for the show
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.760]   okay good you know how you like the weather and it's really hot you know
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.920]   like kids you know like you know that is get ready it's gonna be great you're
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.360]   gonna look what do you like do you kids like summer do you like summer yeah how
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.160]   about you know how much you like summer guess what actually here in Northern
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.320]   California you're in Connecticut right now but here in Northern California
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.440]   but here in Northern California and you too rich in Southern California we had
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.080]   the worst wildfires over the last few years that's really what's scaring me I
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:59.600]   don't know I don't know if I can stay here it's been really not not the climate
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.000]   haven yeah you got the sea level rise you got the wildfires you got the heat you
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.640]   got the drought oh yeah and of course the big one the big one what's the big one
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.920]   the earthquake big one there's a bigger one big one it's the big one the big one
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.200]   not technically climate change related but it is lurking out there it is over
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   enough the thing I worry about the least of all of those things like it's a
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.400]   thing I'm most concerned I felt like I was a kid that was the thing I was the
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.600]   most scared of is most concerned about and then because you know it's like we
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.760]   had the Lander's quake and then we had Northridge and it was like oh the big
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.440]   one's coming and now I'm just like that was like the least of my worries I'm
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.120]   more concerned about you know not having water in five years yeah life is just
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.680]   uncertain I think worrying about the future is probably doesn't pay off but
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.720]   there's plenty to worry about the present we can worry about that in fact
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:01.560]   this story just breaking as as we began the show from Reuters hackers believed
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.440]   to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.160]   US Treasury Department and another agency that decides internet and
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.920]   telecommunications policy this is now in the hands of the National Security
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:22.240]   Council they had an emergency meeting at the White House today there's concern
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.160]   within the US intelligence community that the Russian hackers who targeted
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.040]   Treasury and the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.320]   Information Administration have used a similar tool to break into other
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.160]   government agencies this is according to four according to Reuters who say they
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.880]   learned this from four people briefed on the matter but the people didn't say
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.720]   which other agencies as always it's hard to attribute these but apparently Russia
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:58.040]   is currently believed to be behind the attack you may remember that fire eye
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:06.760]   which a big US cyber security company disclose was hacked fairly recently and
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.920]   apparently tools that they had hacking tools they had were exfiltrated it is
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:20.520]   believed that perhaps these are related so this is a mess and probably couldn't
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.200]   have happened at a worse time well maybe it could have happened been worse if it
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.760]   happened right before the election the hackers broke into the NTIA's Microsoft
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:39.000]   Office 365 staff emails were monitored by hackers for months this is one of
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.640]   those advanced persistent threats they sat on the network and this watched what
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.680]   was going on yikes the hackers are highly sophisticated according to Reuters and
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.320]   have been able to trick the Microsoft platforms authentication controls another
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.240]   person briefed on the matter said this is for sure a nation state the full scope
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.280]   of the breach is as yet unclear so there's not much to say and as you're
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.640]   listening to this you know as we're talking on a Sunday afternoon this is
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.480]   just breaking I suspect over the next few days we'll learn more maybe but this
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:19.200]   is where I think warfare is headed is cyber warfare for sure for sure and it's
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.640]   weird there there really hasn't been a lot of breach news in like a year I mean
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.080]   remember for a while every other month it was Sony's target somebody and I guess
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.960]   it's like everybody got distracted with the with the pandemic had so many other
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.120]   things to worry about but you know what the hackers were not slowed down by the
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.280]   pandemic they took that as an opportunity in many cases I think well I think you
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.080]   know it's one thing for the the government but for the average person it's
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.360]   like you know I always just think about you know what what I have out there and
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.200]   you know what what I could be hacked with and you know it's like that two-factor
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.280]   authentication I talk to people all the time like you gotta set this up you got
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.320]   to make sure you use different passwords and I'm talking to people all the
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.120]   time and you know you know Leo I'm sure all of you know this but like when you're
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.440]   a tech person you're kind of like that doctor at the party where you're like
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.000]   all right now tell me your passwords I can like figure this out and it's like
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.440]   okay it's a Roomba one two three four I'm like what yeah try one two three four
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.560]   five at the end I'm like wait seriously I mean this is like no people are still
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.040]   using these terrible passwords and they don't want it they don't want to make it
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.120]   hard because then they can't log in so but you know what really about it
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.760]   here's the thing it doesn't matter even if everybody in the country magically
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.120]   started using long complicated passwords all distinct and change them
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.680]   every day that's completely irrelevant to data breaches a breach is when they
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.040]   get the database of passwords it doesn't matter it's not our fault it's not
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.040]   even matter at that point when they get a password because right I already have
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.120]   all your information right it sounded like they were said they got into
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.320]   Microsoft authentication like you know it looks like they were just watching
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.000]   the emails being sent back and forth I mean are we not putting two factor on
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.720]   our government 365 sure we are so although I remember four years ago the DNC hack
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.800]   Marty Podesta the chairman of the Democratic National Committee what was
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.760]   this password it was like password what to three or something it was terrible
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.400]   so bad it was finished yeah it reminds me of a long time ago someone used to
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:29.320]   someone told me whatever technology you see the military have they're 20 years
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   ahead and I would like to amend that today to say whatever cipher technology
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.600]   you see all of us using subtract 20 years that's what the government's using
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:47.680]   because I feel like we just cannot upgrade our infrastructure and and really
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.760]   a big part of it is you know you see these these senators these these
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.840]   representatives these Congress people they're printing out their tweets yeah
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.360]   they're printing them yeah yeah it's a crits wild executive still do that I'm
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.760]   not on email I'll just have my secretary print out the email and I'll read it
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.680]   hand write the answer and would you send that for me well it's like large
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.920]   corporations that this new software comes out and they don't want to upgrade
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.480]   their computers because it breaks one tiny piece of functionality that they
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.200]   use in their organization and so it's like you know I'm editing on one version
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.480]   of a program because I've got my personal computer and someone I'm working
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.880]   with like I can update I have an update in a year because you know it breaks our
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.200]   graphics program it's like wait what like what this is something I try to
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.000]   explain on the radio show and I don't think I've done a very good job but that
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.640]   there is this issue of your personal information as you point out of your
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.480]   personal information being or your phone being hacked or whatever that's less
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.640]   likely because these are kind of general attacks across a broad scope of
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:55.520]   people they're not going after you per se it's all a numbers game that's a
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.160]   little easier to protect against in fact I think everybody can doing simple
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.600]   things like two-factor but then there's another level entirely of this nation
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:10.040]   state hacking where I mean we're learning about we learned about just last week
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:17.120]   a drive-by attack on iPhones it's been patched I don't want to scare you but it
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.600]   was discovered last spring by Google's project zero where you wouldn't even
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.920]   have to touch the iPhone you could be in another room capture the airdrop packets
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:34.000]   flying through the air modify them you could hack the iPhone get into it get
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.560]   in full access to everything on the iPhone but worse yet it could then worm
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.920]   itself into every other iPhone and encounters so a nation state should you
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:51.520]   know sitting at a cafe in Tel Aviv waiting for the Israeli you know
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.280]   attache or the US attache to walk by have a cup of coffee hack his phone he goes
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.800]   back to the US embassy every phone in the embassy is then hacked by him in turn
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:07.360]   via a wormable exploit this was a nightmare attack a no touch no involvement
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.160]   attack that's the kind of thing that fortunately was patched and probably
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.140]   isn't gonna buy any one of us but I would not be surprised at all if a nation
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.760]   state or somebody like fire I had this for a long time and just they sat on it
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.720]   because they're using it for specific targeted attacks so I try to explain on
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.080]   the radio there's a mass attack you know those are easy to thwart you don't have
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.560]   to worry so much but if you're a spy a military attache if if you're the target
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:44.080]   of a nation state it's basically hopeless you're dead you might as and so I don't
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.760]   know what we're doing for ops sec the fact that the Treasury Department was
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.400]   hacked probably shouldn't be too surprising we had a panel a little while
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:57.040]   ago red team versus blue team about attack and defense a last pass panel last
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:03.280]   month and we had people like Bruce Schneier on Bruce who is one of the key
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:09.760]   kings of security said it's hopeless there's nothing you can do you assume
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.800]   you should assume that you're not only under attack but that you have been hacked
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.560]   and and that they are wandering around you should assume that there is nothing
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.480]   you can do you try to mitigate it maybe and there are lots of things you should
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.720]   be doing in one hopes that the Treasury Department and NTIA was doing but I this
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.120]   is my fear and this is what I actually was getting at David was I were I think
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.900]   just like we have a Geneva accord because there are some military technologies
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:44.880]   like poison gas that is so horrendous we just agree you know universally never
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.560]   to use these because if one side doesn't you do it's just horrendous that we need
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:56.240]   a Geneva accord for cyber attacks because these are so pervasive and
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.760]   problematic if we use them they're going to use them we all have to agree to just
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:06.560]   put these by the wayside do you think that's even possible no I'm not sure I
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.040]   mean I know where you're coming from Leo I mean you've always been a huge
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.840]   advocate for security and privacy I've always been a little more relaxed about
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.280]   it I mean not for state secrets obviously obviously obviously but like when it
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.440]   comes to targeted ads for example yeah I don't but that's bother me no I get
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.000]   some of my best ideas for reviews from the targeted as the tech products that
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.800]   show I'd rather see ads for a product I'm interested in then something I'm not
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.360]   interested in of course yeah I mean although you did say something is you
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.200]   you're like we've probably all been hacked have you fooled around in the
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:50.760]   latest Mac and iOS operating systems in that new Safari password yeah protocol
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.800]   checker I love that shows which of your passwords have been in a breach yep it's
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.400]   amazing and actually firefox in Chrome has been doing for a while with
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.960]   extensions one password also has a watch tower feature that like notifies you if
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   you are if you double up on passwords on any given website if you if it's been
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.280]   used in a breach if it's it I mean it prompts you for like a whole bunch of
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.520]   stuff which I use one password I that's like the password manager that I have
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.320]   been using a lot of credit to to Troy Hunt of have I been pwned because he's
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.480]   been the guy who yeah keeping track of password breaches you can go to have
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.920]   I've been known comms see if a password that you use is is in these breaches it
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:38.120]   almost always is yeah you know I think there's two things though like what David
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.880]   was saying there's like privacy and I get it like it's so privacy is like kind
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.840]   of so overblown with like you know I deal with like the average person that's
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.760]   watching the news and they're always worried about Facebook tracking them in
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.800]   Instagram and all stuff and like when it came to like the COVID-19 you know
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.720]   notification exposure notification systems in California everyone was like
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.960]   no way like that's government tracking me I'm like well it's not but but I think
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.880]   there's privacy and then there's security and I think that like when it
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.720]   comes to your email and your photos like I would hope that people want those to
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.560]   remain private and that you know it seems like to me that companies like
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.880]   Google and all these other companies are trying to they're almost protecting us
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.240]   from ourselves like when we use these like I was helping my dad the other day
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.120]   with some photos and like I logged in with his password from my computer and
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.960]   even though he doesn't have to factor on it's still said like we think something's
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.920]   a little suspicious here because they saw I was logging in from California
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.960]   versus where he lives and where he typically logs in I thought that was
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.160]   pretty smart I was like that's a good kind of protection that he wouldn't
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.840]   have in place but you know Google kind of figures that out so I do think there's
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.800]   two things writing which is privacy and security which they're not always the
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.560]   same they do but they do to some degree together I'll give you an example David
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:53.680]   of a privacy invasion that actually is related to this and could be a hazard
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.400]   apparently the United States has been using the Patriot Act to gather logs of
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   website visitors so the Patriot Act which gives government very broad powers
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:12.800]   has been used by FBI to collect logs from websites that list everybody who's
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:19.040]   visited those web pages now that's a privacy breach but then when the
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.200]   government gets it that becomes something a little of a little more
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.640]   concerned and then when the government is breached that becomes something a
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:31.200]   little bit more concerned so they do tie together and I'm with you I'm not I'm
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:39.440]   not a privacy Puritan I'm not I'm not saying we it's understandable we trade a
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.000]   certain amount of privacy a certain amount of convenience and usefulness but at
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.480]   the same time there is a relationship between your security and your privacy
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.840]   and when you I mean the biggest tech companies are built on this I mean
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.520]   built on oh yeah Google and Facebook said I mean yeah I mean that's that's
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.480]   their job is really the only one that's like kind of done a pretty good job
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.600]   like this like exactly right and that's why when people are like talking about
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.720]   how expensive Apple stuff is it's like well when you go on the iPhone the stuff
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.520]   that they have built into you know the latest operating system is like it's
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.640]   pretty amazing like that one like I don't know if you download a new app and it
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.920]   says like you know do you want to share I we get the whole like one time share
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.160]   of your location but then it goes into like do you want to share your course
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.680]   privacy or your course location or your precise which is something that like
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.440]   Twitter is collecting people's exact locations for years now and the fact that
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.080]   you can you know the Apple kind of realizes that and says okay you know what
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   let's give them like city level versus like exactly where Rich DeBiro is
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.160]   tweeting from like I that's pretty ingenious for Apple to you know and now
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.760]   I think Google's doing a little bit more of that with their operating system
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.240]   fair right like that fair like it's like okay I get that there are some pieces
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.640]   of information that help these companies these tech companies make better
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.000]   products do their job you know obviously like Apple's voice assistant but I'm
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.200]   not gonna say her name because my home pod is gonna go crazy because her
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.680]   mo around here she never responds to that thing is that's the exchange that
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.680]   we make for having you know if you own an Apple product you're giving less data
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.960]   in that way to Apple and so they're gonna have a subpar product compared to
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.280]   the other voice assistants out there that collect a lot more information on a
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.080]   regular basis because it's because it's opt out not opt out a little cynical I
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:34.520]   kind of feel like Apple would collect this information if it's not out of
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.640]   the goodness of their hearts yeah they're not altruistic it's just because
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.800]   their business model isn't selling ads well also because they tried to sell ads
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.560]   in that flopped their iads product was a flop so they made a virtue out of a
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.680]   failure and said yeah hey you know what we don't want that information after
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.800]   all right classic Steve Jobs and now it's a marketing now it's marketing because
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.040]   it's like every other company like if you look at Amazon I mean all of the
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   smart home products from the three big companies you know or I guess you
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.440]   include Facebook but the portal hasn't really taken off but I mean if you look
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.480]   at all those products I mean really they're they're way like I was thinking
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.880]   about this the other day because I've got the Google Assistant here and I
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.120]   noticed when my kid said something it they stopped a timer and Google at the
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.320]   end said something I can't remember what it was it was like by the way you know I
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.200]   can also do this and I try as me what freakin nuts I don't want to know it's
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.360]   got very very verbose lately that's that's getting us ready for an
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.200]   advertisement to be slipped in there work and say yeah you know you just
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:40.080]   asked for your yeah would you be a wire for yours on set yeah I mean there have
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.720]   been situations where when I actually wished that Apple would take more of my
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.680]   data to be more Google like you know Google Maps when you're when you put in
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:56.360]   a destination you type one character and it's got it seven oh no you were there
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.040]   15 times last year David
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.880]   like Google like you put in one number and it gives you target in Nevada or
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.280]   something yeah exactly it's like let me show you what I found on the web and
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.360]   it's like hey here's this place you went to 20 years ago like we remember that
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.560]   and I'm just like it's a little creepy but also like it's handy well let me
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:21.920]   ask you all three of you are when Apple says we're the privacy company and
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.680]   they've sure doubled down on over the last couple of years do you trust them
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.800]   do you believe them do you use an iPhone because you feel like it's a safer
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:37.120]   device David well here's the thing no and how do you know any of them are
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.120]   telling the truth right I mean they show these declarations when you download an
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.920]   app this app would like this data they say I mean at a certain point you know how
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.040]   do you know by the way Wilbur has something to say hey Wilbur Wilbur is a
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:58.520]   doorbzel Wilbur is a orange cat does he care about his privacy he does he
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:05.960]   makes it more than clear leave me alone human you know it's funny with the you
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.320]   know with the whole privacy thing when it comes to Apple like cuz I actually I
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   actually don't like that Apple protects my privacy because when you know when
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.720]   I'm using an Android device it's kind of like that thing that David was talking
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.760]   about that we were just talking about where you type in one letter and it kind
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.280]   of it auto completes exactly what it thinks you're searching for whereas on
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.480]   my iPhone because it doesn't collect all that data it's like I have to type so
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:35.160]   many more things in like I am like just doing more lazy rich
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:42.240]   is that the reason you want to give it all up so that the type so much but it's
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.040]   not just convenience though it's also annoyance like honestly iOS and Mac OS
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.880]   have gotten more and more and more annoying I download a photo app and it
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:59.800]   says this app would like access to your photos well no kidding well I how about
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.560]   you actually you believe Apple when they say they're more open it it said they
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   said this app is not trusted move to trash and I was like that was my only
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.720]   option that annoys me no none of my none of your business how would yeah how
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   would my mom know to go into settings and go into you know the security thing and
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.760]   say you know open anyway she would never find that thousand right how about
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:28.880]   you actually do you trust Apple so I think of the four of us I'm the only not
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:41.600]   white man I believe you're correct yes and I think that for me I have seen too
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:48.280]   many friends I've seen too many news stories about rich rich made a really
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.720]   good point a little while ago that there's a difference between a targeted
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.680]   ad and somebody having access to say like your photos in a breach right your
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:04.240]   private things you want to keep private and you know I I put pictures of my kid
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.720]   online every now and again but I would not fire hose them on the internet and
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:15.280]   you know I have picture just just cherished pictures of like my family
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.080]   subsist you know I have a picture of my grandma in the ICU the day she passed away
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:24.200]   like just pictures that like I would never want made public I just would
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:32.920]   never want to trust iCloud with them and and I I trust Apple enough to choose
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.440]   their product over other phone makers so you put it on iCloud but not Google
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:45.800]   photos I think because of their stance on encryption I'm I am more inclined to
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:53.120]   choose Apple if Google changed its mind if they I it's it's a hard
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.040]   conversation because as David mentions and it's a little bit of a cynics take
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:03.560]   but it's not untrue it which is how much can you trust any of these tech
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.600]   companies to actually tell us what's going on what they're actually collecting
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.760]   how much they know about us how much access they have I mean Apple can say
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.440]   all day long like we don't have access to XYZ thing on your phone but like do
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.400]   we really know that I we don't you know and and we may never know that but but
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.480]   at the end of the day with the information that is in front of me and
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.200]   what I know and what I would like to protect the the information I would
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:33.280]   like to protect I use an iPhone for that reason and I actually have gotten
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.120]   away from I left Gmail for that which is this has been a wild couple of months
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:45.520]   for me leaving Gmail has been like just very bizarre and extricating yourself
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:53.040]   from that ecosystem is difficult but I moved over to hate.com and oh really
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.880]   yeah you trust David Hine my or Hanson with your email why I'd be worried about
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.480]   the longevity of that email though that's you know so base gets says that they're
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.480]   supporting it permanently like this is not a thing that they're gonna sundown
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.520]   good I actually oddly enough I think I trust base camp more than I trust
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.480]   Google to launch a new product and keep that alive because it was just literally
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.560]   just like kill things Google can't trust all the time so it's you know G-mails
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:24.280]   like one of the few things that they haven't killed so I so I'm why not I'm
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.320]   trying it out I mean all my stuff still stays on my my Gmail account it's it's
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:34.160]   on that server but new emails now are going to that hate.com email address
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.880]   funny I did the same thing I moved everything off Gmail a few years ago I
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   was using Gmail because they had the best Danny spam filtering but once yeah
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:50.040]   once it didn't matter I started using fast mail which is an Australian email
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.000]   provider because I figured well I'm paying them that's probably better than
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.200]   getting something for free and I'm slowly weaning myself off of Google I
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   used to really love Google but I I'm starting to trust them less and less and
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.080]   we're gonna talk a little bit about their labor issues and firing Timrit
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.960]   Jabru which is pretty horrendous and some of the things they've been doing
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.440]   lately I feel like they're less and less trustworthy if even because their
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:23.680]   attention span is so short yes 100% and and I trust Apple thing I do trust
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.040]   Apple but I but what the only way you should really trust a company is by
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.440]   looking at what their profit motive is because their only job is to maximize
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.920]   profits and I trust Apple to protect my privacy mostly because it's in their
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.080]   interest it's in their profit interest that's their business model and the more
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.880]   that becomes a business model the more I will trust them ultimately though you
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.000]   know if what you're worried about is that they're gonna give your grandmother's
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.600]   picture to the government I wouldn't trust them because they will do that at
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.280]   the drop of a hat not that the government wants that yeah I mean I think
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.960]   it's just more of like you know we we've seen so many like let's say celebrities
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:10.120]   in these you know these like photo breaches a long time ago but but
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:15.960]   generally speaking like for me it's been partly what you were talking about
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:22.000]   with like you know I just you know the whole like what is it don't be evil or
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.400]   yeah that's now right it's just it really feels they're evil let's face it
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.840]   feels bad it feels it all feels so bad like I left Facebook this year I
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.880]   believe all my stuff from Facebook I'm like I just I would like to stop
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:41.440]   supporting companies that I really feel are like actively harming as opposed to
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:52.320]   maybe like bumbling bumbling sort of like ignorance harm but it's just like
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.520]   it really to me I just I'm at a point now where I'm like I just I can't support
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.160]   that anymore it's like Facebook for example I just feel really strongly that
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.400]   it just is actively harming society I don't want to give attention I gotta
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.840]   get I'm I go one out of that system and there is nothing I want more than to get
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   out of Instagram or have the government break it up I'm just I would like to be
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:19.160]   out of that ecosystem I want an Oculus so bad I'm not gonna do it not buy one
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.600]   I will not buy one because you have to have a Facebook account to do it I'm not
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.480]   gonna do it yeah so let me ask you because you started this and I don't know
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:33.640]   is it because we're white men we're we're we privacy is a it's a privileged
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.720]   position we have about security and privacy that people of color and women
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.120]   can't afford is that kind of I think it's I think it's I think in my experience
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.720]   and I I can't speak for the larger because I don't study it I don't research
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.920]   it full disclosure they're like and fully admitted but in in my experience
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.120]   and and having been around tech for the for over a decade at this point and and
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:06.000]   talk to so many people about it I have found that oddly enough like just straight
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.480]   white men tend to tend to care the least about about giving their data away for
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.800]   something returning it is a privilege in a way and and there are a lot of people
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:21.360]   in this world who need anonymity you know there are people in other countries
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.600]   in our baby even in our country who are afraid of being tracked because they're
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.200]   they're protesting something that is really important to them and they they
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.440]   don't want people to know who they are or they're giving information you know to
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.680]   the public that they you know is really is really sensitive and you know for me
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.200]   it's just it's very much like I every every woman in tech that I know is like
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.000]   very protective of their data and very protective of their information and you
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.680]   know I have this problem even outside of tech you know we have these scraper
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.480]   sites in California where where for whatever reason like I don't know how it
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.640]   is in other states but you know we have these like what is it like Spokio or
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.000]   whatever where you can look up a person and their address yeah and it's just
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.240]   why does this exist like we have this because it's public information it's
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.000]   public information but why does it have to be public information I could have I
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.160]   remember the time where you could be like unlisted in the phone book right like
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.760]   you pay a little for whatever and you pay for that but the thing is is like this
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.760]   is sort of how we built this and technology came along and we just said
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.680]   well we'll just keep doing what we were doing before without actually considering
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:33.520]   the ramifications of that which is now not only can I look somebody up and up
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:39.000]   in a phone book the phone book is now the entire world and so it's the internet
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.240]   and so for me you know California or any other state allowing this should not
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.400]   allow these things oh oh I'm sorry the FTC is talking so let me let me shut them
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.000]   you would think of all the websites in the world they would not have auto play
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.240]   all right I'm sorry they're trying to get their video numbers up there's
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.840]   Christ stop it actually it's it sounds like that you're retreating from Facebook
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:07.400]   and Google is not about you are afraid that they can get access to your data and
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.920]   some human is going to look at it it's more a general discomfort with their
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.320]   negative effect on society yeah and I think that it's it's mostly that it's
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:23.320]   sort of that like lesser of all evils where I'm just like I feel so
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.520]   uncomfortable the line has been so crossed with those companies in a lot of
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.360]   ways that I just can't I can no longer bring myself to to put myself in their
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.120]   ecosystems like that's a big thing for me so it's not necessarily that I really
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:44.240]   feel an extra level of trust with Apple but it's not at least at the base level
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:49.760]   of it like Rich was saying I know that their business model and Leo's like
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.880]   their business model sort of relies on protecting user information so at the
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:00.800]   very just the bare minimum lowest bar at least they can sort of like half clear
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   that like that's that's how I feel about it it's just it's it's so you know I
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.160]   think you're right we can't just you can't take any of these companies word I
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.480]   mean it's just it's all a bunch of corporate you know back they have a
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.680]   responsibility to their stakeholders to make money as whatever way they can
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:24.920]   that's I've never I've never gotten on board with you know being making part
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.640]   of your identity I know a product or a company and this is why I used to be
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.760]   Android Ashley like when I started out in this industry I was Android Ashley
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:38.200]   and I remember getting death threats and rape threats when I got in I had
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   tweeted I got an iPhone as a second line just to know what the competition was
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:49.400]   that was it that was all the only one on my phone and and I got so many awful
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:57.000]   emails from people who were just furious and you know I just to me I can't there
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.840]   are things I am enthusiastic about there are things I am a fan of I there are
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.080]   certain things I absolutely love their game companies that I love and there are
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.880]   tech companies that I really enjoy and there are products I really like and and
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.760]   I will tell my friends about them and evangelize about them because I enjoy
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.200]   them and I think they're good but but at the end of the day I just I can't attach
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.160]   my identity to any of these companies and I think that that's actually one of
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:27.440]   the biggest problems that we see in in sort of like the the consumer base we
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.040]   sort of turned it into this like it's not just tech actually this is universal this
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:37.560]   tribal is yeah this tribalism is like it's the problem losers it's no longer sort
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.920]   of it's yeah it's just winners and losers and it's like it just doesn't have to
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.440]   be that like it just never has to be that you had people stabbing each other in
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.640]   Washington DC over the election the tribalism has gone way beyond any I
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.040]   don't know maybe it's not new maybe we've always been this way you know
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   Protestants always been this way but years and you super charges now because of
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.320]   the Internet and places like Facebook yeah like social media yeah does anybody
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.560]   know what that that there was a again like there was something I had read where
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.280]   they said imagine every single person in the world getting their own newspaper
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.240]   written exactly for them to tell them only the news that they want to hear and
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.600]   like that's basically the Internet you don't have to imagine yeah and it's like
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.440]   that's that's what it is it's that everyone gets no one's getting the same
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.240]   everyone gets this little individualized thing and I don't know that it's
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.920]   necessarily I personally have slugged somebody because he uses VI instead of
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:39.280]   Emacs it and so I I completely understand how how vicious these battles can be
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.720]   kind of no it's a shame that you got death threats that's terrible I you know
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.400]   it's ridiculous I hate saying it's like oh it's just being a lady in tech but it
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.840]   kind of is like ever I don't know anybody who hasn't experienced no it's
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:55.240]   everyone yeah the other thing is that Twitter and to some degree Facebook
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.760]   enable this kind of drive by hate it's so easy growth and engagement it's yeah
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.200]   and it's so low cost that I think people do and say things that they wouldn't
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:12.120]   normally do and say being abusive is easy and and and free yeah I want to take
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.840]   a little break we should get to we've been circling around this we should get
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:22.160]   to this Facebook has been sued for a monopolization by the FTC 46 states DC
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:29.960]   and Guam this is a big lawsuit unlike perhaps some of the other lawsuits we've
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:34.920]   seen recently I don't think it's political I think this one's pretty serious

[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.520]   subs I don't know the post office gives them a deal for one because of their
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.960]   volume post office loves you know David you know in DICIA right this is the
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.600]   the thing when you print a stamp with stamps.com there used to be other
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.120]   companies doing this I think stamp owns them all including in DICIA but
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.280]   they're that's called in DICIA and there's a barcode on and stuff it speeds up
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.640]   the mail for the post office so much because they can scan that that I think
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.080]   they actually want you they really prefer you do that the other thing that
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.760]   happens is normally you can't put a package that's greater than a pound in
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:54.480]   the mail that since 9/11 9/11 you have to bring it to post office they can look
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.800]   at you and say are you a terrorist but because stamps.com's in DICIA ties to
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.680]   your account they don't you can put you can put it in the post office box as
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.920]   matter if it's more than a pound so there's the post office wants you to do
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.280]   this there's also let's be honest there's a subscription with stamps.com I don't
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.480]   know how much of that goes towards it as well but it's not that much so I mean
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.560]   there's no just not like you get a nickel off every stamp up to the first
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:21.600]   10 it's like forever so I don't that's what I'm saying I don't understand why
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.280]   people don't use it but this is not if you're if you're an Etsy shipper or
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:30.600]   something or an Amazon associate yeah you got to use it and they've acquired
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:36.240]   pretty much everybody who used to do this so you pretty much that's the that's
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.200]   the one to go with that's all I can say that's not part of the ad either so
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:50.600]   F Wednesday Federal Trade Commission came out with a 124 page lawsuit which I
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:58.920]   read from cover to cover fascinating in dining a Facebook for monopolistic
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.080]   practices they had a lot of you know clearly they've been doing their research
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.960]   for a long time they had emails they had a lot of internal information they had
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.440]   what I consider in many cases smoking guns Mark Zuckerberg saying yeah we got
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.920]   to buy Instagram and put them out of business things like that it seems to me
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.080]   to be an open the shut case but the problem I'm sure it won't be I'm sure
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:28.080]   it'll go on for years the the problem is what's the remedy you can my wife was
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.160]   saying this the other day she said you can't it's like you can't make them get
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.840]   rid of Instagram and what's apt now like you gave them permission years ago you
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:44.640]   can't say oh sorry we take it back or can you actually this is really interesting
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.240]   first of all I also read the entire thing I was weren't you impressed yes how
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.280]   like plain English and well written it very well written whoever wrote it it
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:59.920]   wasn't legal ease no it was very clear and I thought kind of an in a damning
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.480]   indictment to be honest so Mark Zuckerberg's argument against this is
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:11.920]   whoa whoa whoa FTC you approved our purchase of these right well he's he's
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:17.840]   right but he's also wrong because I also looked up the actual approval from the
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:23.040]   FTC when it happened and the last line you can look this up online is we
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.120]   reserve the right at any point to change our mind to revisit this decision okay
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.840]   and now they are and you could make the case when they bought Instagram Nova
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.880]   you know it was a little company that five employees they weren't huge although
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.200]   the in the indictment they make the strong case that they were already so
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.080]   successful that it was legitimate for Facebook to say these guys could eat
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.200]   our lunch but a lot of people say off oh Instagram wouldn't have been Instagram
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.560]   what's app wouldn't have been what's app if Facebook hadn't bought them but it
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.680]   was very clear I think that they Facebook looked at these companies and
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.840]   others like Snapchat they mentioned a company that Facebook tried to buy
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.240]   forever but they didn't say the name I'd have to be Snapchat right I don't know
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.320]   yeah why why do you think they redacted I don't know so much of that documents
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.680]   probably redacted like weird things too like it was like yeah how many users
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.880]   they had every month I was like isn't that like public knowledge I think that
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:21.200]   that wasn't that's the point which is that they had internal documents and they
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.080]   were probably rightly so being a little protective of Facebook's
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.400]   privileged business information that they had access to stuff that wasn't
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:34.480]   public must have been right otherwise the document the document makes a really
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:42.280]   good case that Facebook either bought companies and subsumed them like what's
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:47.920]   app and Instagram or just bought them to shut them down they named glancy yeah
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.560]   and another one they just bought them and then and they said this is all a
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.920]   screaming violation of the Sherman antitrust act right and you read this
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:02.640]   document you're like of course like very it's a violation yeah but we didn't but
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.600]   what I could thinking but they all do this right right Google Microsoft they
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.200]   all buy up companies and shut them down well remember remember David you and I
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:19.400]   of course are old enough to remember 1998 Microsoft DOJ and Microsoft was
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.720]   predatory in the 90s right same thing in Gulf and Devour right the whole idea
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.200]   Microsoft would go take a meeting with a company get all of the information
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.360]   about the company say yeah thanks anyway and then duplicate it over and over
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.580]   again DOJ came after him it was a protracted battle I know it was a long
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:42.360]   time because it started the day tech TV launched and it and even after tech TV
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:46.160]   went out of business this was still going on so I know it was a long battle
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:52.000]   eventually there was a consent decree Microsoft allowed an ombudsman inside the
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.040]   company to watch over them but I think more than anything the effect of the DOJ
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:01.520]   lost it against Microsoft was to chasing them to make them in their boardroom say
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.320]   yeah maybe we shouldn't do that that that would ups you know that could cause
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:10.800]   more problems for us and I I would bet that some of the benefit of this whether
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:16.160]   they succeed against Facebook or not is to get Google Apple Microsoft Amazon
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.040]   especially to sit up and take notice and say look the government is not a
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:27.520]   complete pushover it's mostly a pushover they let NBC Universal and Comcast merge
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:35.520]   they let AT&T acquire Warner HBO and Turner I think I think the bigger I think
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.520]   the issue here I mean I look at this from two ways number one what's the
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.640]   benefit to the consumer of breaking up Facebook like does it how does it make
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.440]   my life any better or you know do you want me to answer that that's well in a
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:51.840]   second but I think the other part is if you start a company there's almost no
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.760]   way to compete with these large companies that's it point that's the answer
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.960]   your first question and you're done right so I mean it's like it's like I
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.560]   don't even know how Dropbox is still you know functioning when you've got you
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.200]   know it's like they're this small company compared you know they and they're
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.720]   buying up a little companies but it's like you can't start a messaging app
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.160]   today and have it compete with what is already out there that's the answer to
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.760]   your question that's the harm so there's consumer harm is business harm yeah
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.520]   there's no innovation okay because you can't compete is somebody gonna start a
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.880]   search engine is somebody gonna start a social network to compete with Facebook
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:32.800]   today you'd be nuts right even it's a photo photo social platform right me
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.920]   just gonna get you're either gonna get eaten up by Facebook or you're gonna get
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:41.240]   bought by Facebook and either integrated and shut down right right and now I
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.840]   have to say it's a system of Instagram is probably very happy they got a
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:48.600]   billion dollars from Facebook he's not crying although he wasn't happy with
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.720]   what Facebook did Instagram and eventually left the founders like he's a
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.320]   guy that might start a company that's similar to Instagram but it will it
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.480]   ever take you know would it be able to get somewhere if he wanted to he could
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.160]   have but he knows it's like I'm not doing that and here's another example the way
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:14.240]   Amazon it's actually almost tragic remember diapers calm was created to sell
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:19.360]   diapers what Amazon did is they undercut them they undercut them they took all
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:23.300]   their business then they bought them and of course the founder of diapers
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:28.920]   calm was so you know he got his payday but he was so upset with the way this
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:35.640]   happened that he went out and he started jet and jet didn't succeed too well
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:40.400]   because Amazon Walmart bought him he had another big payday I'm sure he's not
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:46.000]   broke but it's very hard to compete against these mammoth companies even
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.120]   Walmart's having a hard time competing against Amazon well I think the goal at
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.080]   this point is not to compete it's to get to get bought that's right you know but
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.240]   the thing is is you end up with a Facebook who will look at you know snap
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.320]   chats a great example they there was a there was interest there they thought you
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:07.840]   know and then Evan was like no and then Mark Zuckerberg decided to crush them
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.360]   you know and it's like it's like they just okay well let's just copy everything
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.520]   that they're doing how it's so that's an interesting question you're right I
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.280]   mean they copied him completely Instagram stories are you know that's snapchat
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:24.780]   basically it has that hurt snapchat oh yeah yeah they're not
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:29.420]   I mean they I mean I don't know if they're not as big I'm sure they're bigger
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:33.820]   than ever but it's you know how the growth there had you know the trajectory
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:38.900]   of growth has been severely diminished ever since Instagram stories so they
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:43.340]   could have been a new Facebook yeah it could have been its own thing we're
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:49.100]   like stories yeah this format of telling a story with stories is this is
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.580]   where you go for that and now it's become it's kind of like I always say
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:57.380]   this it's like RST LNE and will fortune it's now like the table stakes it's
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.660]   like everyone give you that you give you that we give you stories you want
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.780]   what's up do we give you stories you want to shop on Amazon you can shop via
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:08.900]   stories it's like every app now has stories LinkedIn has story slack has
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:14.100]   everything which is the worst idea guys let's go let's go right up our fleets
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:19.340]   right exactly Twitter as stories did we just call them fleets yeah there's
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:23.900]   stories yeah but the FTC complaint actually said that that Zuckerberg was
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:30.140]   worried about WhatsApp becoming a social media feed Facebook right he was
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:34.220]   like we got to shut them down before they become like us the other thing I
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:39.100]   thought was weird about that complaint by the FTC in the States is that it said
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:44.380]   this is unfair to the advertisers like who's who's worried about how they're
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:50.700]   harmed right it said that I am I forget about it if you're if you're a small
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:54.460]   business and you're spending money on Amazon to try to get your you know here's
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.460]   what they do on Yelp you you know you set up your thing on Yelp and next thing
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:01.380]   you know to get anywhere you've got to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.260]   a month just to get some you know some traction there and same thing with Google
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:09.220]   and the bigger these companies get the more you have to spend that's sort of
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.460]   unnecessary right it used to be you took out a big ad in the yellow pages everyone
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.980]   kind of flipped through whatever but now it's like it's just the more companies
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.540]   that are you know the bigger they get the more you have to spend and a lot of
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:24.700]   that spending is is in my kind of eyes nonsense spending like you're just
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.460]   spending to get back to where you were I think there's another another reason
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:33.940]   they brought it up David so traditionally antitrust actions in the United
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:40.260]   States have focused on consumer harms and and it's always been said in Europe
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:45.620]   they focus on innovation on on competing with other companies and I think that
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:51.060]   there's a new generation of people in Congress and in regulation in the federal
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.320]   government who are saying you know we got to consider both consumer harm and
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.420]   harm to innovation harm to other companies and so I think what you're
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:04.060]   seeing there you remember that the the action that the DOJ took against Google
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:11.300]   also it actually was Congress I'm sorry the Democratic only the Democratic half
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:17.140]   of the antitrust committee in in the Congress brought this exact thing up and
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:21.660]   they said are any trust laws have to perhaps be adjusted for the new new era
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.540]   to consider both consumer harm and in innovation harm and I think when you're
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:30.220]   talking about regulating big tech that's a big part of it and ultimately just as
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.580]   you said rich it's consumer harm but what happens is these companies become so
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:39.940]   big you can't compete against them it kills innovation and so they just become
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.660]   more and more entrenched and that's both a harm to other businesses and to
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:47.780]   consumers in the end so I think that's I think there was a specific reason they
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:52.940]   brought up advertisers in fact as I'm reading this I'm seeing a lot I'm reading
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.860]   but maybe I'm over interpreting it but I'm seeing behind the lines a lot that's
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:01.660]   what I'm I agree with you it was so thoughtfully written that clearly they
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:08.460]   were anticipating some of the objections that judges might have to this I think
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.900]   they're going for a judge a decision by a judge as opposed to a jury decision this
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:19.220]   was clearly aimed I think at the bench as opposed to a jury it's very you know
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:22.140]   there's a lot going on I'm not a late-grade legal mind I'm not a lawyer or
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:26.500]   anything but I find to me this is kind of fascinating is to kind of understand
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.740]   there's a game going on there's a chess game going on and the people who
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:36.100]   designed this complaint I think were very very thoughtful about what they
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:43.380]   mentioned and brought up in this so we could go on and on this is week that
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:48.460]   124 pages we got to talk about let's not but what I'm curious about from all
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:53.460]   three of you I'll start with you Ashley is what would be the out a good outcome
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:59.660]   for this would it be breaking up the company would it I mean what how what
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:06.460]   could government do to fix what is clearly a problem with Facebook I mean it does
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:13.100]   feel like I get one of those weird things where it feels like what needed to be
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.780]   done was those those acquisitions should have just never happened right so but
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.180]   we can't get in a time machine we can't go back we can that's David point out
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.900]   we could roll those back I mean yeah but I mean it feels like okay so you break
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:29.260]   up you break that up but then also it does feel like maybe there's some
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:34.860]   regulation some sort of you put you do what they did with Microsoft put
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:40.540]   somebody inside the company to watch and say don't do that maybe or maybe it
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:44.540]   just comes down to a watchdog group that is that is making sure that that
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:49.980]   companies are not blatantly ripping off features from other companies right so
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:54.980]   it's like you know like for me I feel like Snapchat made something really good
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:58.260]   and they should have been rewarded for that right like having it completely
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:03.860]   just you know basically stolen like the entire concept of it stolen and tweaked
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.820]   in a very minor way and been like oh no no see clearly ours is different because
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.700]   they're not horizontal we you have to swipe left and right and not up and down
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:18.260]   or whatever it is you know to me that that seems like a good way to sort of say
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:22.740]   like hey like if you make something really great you should be rewarded for
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.300]   that and it should not be able to be blatantly ripped off by these other
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:31.900]   big tech companies see I'm what I do with what you do Ashley which is I don't
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:36.540]   participate in the ecosystem I don't like Facebook I don't trust Mark Zuckerberg
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:42.060]   I think we're gonna find out he is a moral not only is immoral or evil but he
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:49.780]   is a moral and he's it's not he's not a good steward of of Facebook but it's
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:53.460]   also I should point out we were a privilege we're privileged to do that
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:55.540]   there are a lot of people that's the only way they're very much that's the
[00:59:55.540 --> 01:00:00.500]   only way they can contact families the only way that they have access to there
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.300]   are some places where you know they have that there are emerging markets where
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.980]   they have a slimmed down version of Facebook that is designed for yeah you
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.820]   know yeah and it is their internet yeah and it's it's that's their internet so
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.380]   yeah absolutely we're coming from a place of privilege so I understand that
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:24.580]   not everybody can give up on Facebook yeah rich is there is is there what
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.940]   would be the outcome of this what would be a positive outcome of this lawsuit I
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:34.420]   again I'm I'm trying to figure out what the positive outcome could be because
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.980]   if you look at a company like Facebook and I think about this with Google and
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.100]   with Apple I mean Apple all these big companies it's like you know we talk
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.700]   about the things that they do really well and Facebook what they do really
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:51.180]   well is their social network and they've done really well with their advertising
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:55.780]   and they've done really well with Instagram and so I think about like okay
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.900]   if we broke them up what would be the benefit so it would be that Instagram
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.660]   would now be able to compete against Facebook in the social media category
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.740]   when you look at messaging with Facebook it's like sure they're a leader there
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:12.580]   but I mean they're not the only messaging game in town it's not like
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:16.380]   nobody else uses any in fact I don't really know anyone that uses Facebook
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.980]   messenger at all and now WhatsApp that's probably a different story especially
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.180]   outside Facebook doesn't care if you use WhatsApp they're happy right now they're
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.460]   all merged right now you've got instant you can cross-platform message
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.580]   between Instagram and Facebook and I think WhatsApp is coming soon down the line
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:36.700]   as well so I mean I see things like that so it's like now personally you know I
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.620]   think in some ways that's better because I'm like oh finally all the people that
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.660]   will only be on Instagram I can finally message through Facebook messenger
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.700]   advice versa but I don't know I'm just trying to think what would be the benefit
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.980]   and I think the point that I brought up earlier is really what I keep going
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:54.660]   back to it's like I as a consumer want the most innovation you know if I own a
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.420]   small business I want the best ways to advertise and right now I see three
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:03.540]   ways to advertise which is Google Facebook and Yelp and that's it and so
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:07.780]   a small company to come along like can't really get into that game or you know I
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.020]   want the best messaging platform and it's like well another little company is
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.900]   not going to come along and do that because they just don't have all the
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.540]   ways and means of getting people to sign up or a photo service you know like I
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.940]   want a better photo service but you know Facebook got out of the photo service
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:24.580]   I mean it used to be you could upload all your pictures there and keep them
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.500]   there and now they don't even care about that so you know I don't know what the
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.420]   solution would be why it would be better if they're broken up at this stage in
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:35.500]   the game I think it's more about the innovation being stifled I do see that
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:41.900]   as being a huge part of this yeah David solution yeah that's my problem with
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.660]   this is I don't know what the answer is I don't know how you fix this well part
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.700]   of the problem is that what we're discussing is the way the entire tech
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:54.420]   world works I mean they've all bought up their rivals to shut them down right
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:59.340]   they've all stolen ideas from each other blatantly I I don't know if anyone
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:04.220]   remembers this I'm sure they don't but I spent five years at Yahoo and once when
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:07.860]   I was there I wrote a really what I thought was a really cool article you
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:14.580]   guys know above all how tribal Mac I mean Apple versus Google iPhone versus
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.900]   Android I mean they they hate each other they blast us when they give
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:23.620]   something a good review so and they always say Pogue you said that portrait
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:27.740]   mode feature on the new iPhone is a cool feature but Samsung had it first
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:35.020]   first five years ago exactly so I did this massive research project or I tracked
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:42.780]   down 168 standard features and found out who had it first turns out Google had
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:47.900]   long pressing first but Apple had stress you know stretching and spreading first
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:53.420]   to enlarge a picture and Samsung had portrait mode they all steal all the time
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.580]   yeah you're not gonna be able to show you want that as consumers I don't want a
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:01.580]   phone that has no none of the benefits of Android in my iPhone or vice versa
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.180]   we want that cross-ballingization that makes products better and this is the
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.740]   other thing going back to kind of like these this innovation stifling like you
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.420]   would think with these big companies being in the positions they are that they'd
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.140]   be able to get into any business they want but we've seen them fail over and
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:21.940]   over so like Facebook or yeah Facebook and Amazon tried to make a phone that
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:26.900]   failed right horrendously you know Apple has I'm sure you know there's been like
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.540]   that social media network they tried with their music service that failed I
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.580]   mean there's a lot of things that like these companies just because they're
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:38.460]   huge don't necessarily aren't able to just like I mean look at Microsoft they
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:42.460]   have billions and billions of dollars and Bing cannot figure out a way to get
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:45.860]   people to search on it and they tried for many years now they give up like but
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:50.460]   do you are but I would argue that that is because that because Google has
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:55.820]   created a natural monopoly there just like Apple and Google have created a
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:59.700]   natural monopoly for phones right so it's like you know Facebook could try to
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:03.180]   watch now but it's too late you know and that's why not anyone can make a
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.060]   better I mean why can't I mean there's so many Android phones that come out
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:10.940]   every year I test every single one of them and 99% of them are horrible and
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.140]   they don't repeat with the iPhone so I mean it's really true meant to be
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:18.140]   flagship devices these are meant to be devices for people who can't afford a
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.860]   flagship device who can't who just need a cell phone you know and the thing is
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:26.500]   is like to me it's like I like I are you the Andy Rubin company what was that
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.340]   one that was like you know essentially oh my gosh it was supposed to be so
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:33.900]   amazing and it was like literally the worst I mean it was a great slab but like
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:38.140]   the camera was so bad it was 20 years old I was like taking pictures on a
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:44.020]   potato but it's like you know it's that you know even the biggest companies are
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:49.500]   struggling to get into verticals where a natural monopoly or duopoly already
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:54.700]   exists like and that I guess to me is even more of an argument that these
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.860]   companies should not be this big like they just shouldn't but I don't think
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:06.380]   anybody wants a heavy-handed federal agency to come in and say if this had
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:10.500]   happened at Microsoft they would not have made Microsoft weaker they would have
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.460]   made Microsoft stronger they would have divided Microsoft this was one of the
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.980]   plants into three or four companies each of which would be bigger than Microsoft
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:23.420]   today is and they would have been worse they tried that with mobell they
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.660]   broke up AT&T and what happened we just got a lot of baby bells that just
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:32.180]   reunited and now there it's it's in some ways it's worse so I don't think they
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.300]   all came back together at the end yeah I don't think that govern I don't think
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:39.300]   breaking I don't know what the answer is okay I'm a throw in one thing that this
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:43.540]   is a minefield and I shouldn't bring it up if I were smart I would just shut up
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.660]   but I honestly think that social media we kind of touched on this a little bit
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:53.300]   social media has been bad for democracy it's been bad for this country 100%
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:58.220]   because it's like what you said Ashley everybody's got their own personal
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:04.420]   newspaper filled with facts that they're sure of no one else agrees with
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:09.700]   that's a big to me that's the real hazard of Facebook is that so many
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:15.300]   Americans that's where they get their news yes that's the real hazard and I
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.500]   don't think there's anything to do about that that's protected by the First
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.980]   Amendment I mean you can't I don't know what the government would do you know I
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.140]   wouldn't want the government to come in and say well you shouldn't have post
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:31.420]   posts about anti-vaxx sure I wouldn't want that but also but Mark Zuckerberg isn't
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:35.140]   gonna go do a good job of that either exactly right it's like you cannot rely
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:41.980]   on the you cannot rely on a board of investors to make decisions that are
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.740]   moral decisions because they because it never works out though they want to
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:51.300]   make money there are we stuck with this who is well we do it because one of
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:55.540]   one of the topics on the potential topics list for today was the fact that all
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:02.780]   these executives are leaving Facebook they leave a note a farewell note to
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.660]   their company they say the reason I'm leaving is because I can't stand how
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:10.980]   little this company is doing yeah to stop misinformation and hate speech so
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:15.660]   obviously there is a sector there are people who think that Facebook should be
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:19.620]   in the business of regulating hate speech and yeah let's
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:27.860]   how do you think Mark cares you think Mark looks at these guys I go oh I gotta do
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.460]   better I think he cares I think I don't think he wants because he's looking at
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:37.100]   the growth of Facebook and if Facebook is is synonymous with misinformation
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:42.660]   which it sort of is right now that is not a good trajectory to be on now
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.300]   imagine you know I work for a news organization right I mean we are and I
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:51.300]   you know I've been in the newspaper world in the in the TV world in the radio and
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.820]   like the whole point of like the system that was built of journalism in
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:59.620]   America for you know the past whatever years is you had reporters and editors
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:03.900]   and fact checkers and you put stuff out there that you believe to be true to the
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:08.180]   best of your knowledge that's all that's all upended by anyone being able to
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:11.420]   start a blog and putting a link on Facebook and sending it out to a million
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:16.020]   billion people so God the system has changed and I don't know what the answer
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:19.380]   is but like you can't go through every link on Facebook and they try AI and
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.220]   this and that but like who even sits there in fact checks every single web
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:27.020]   page that is immediately put up with information on it and you have bots I
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.980]   mean there's just too many things going on that's the big issue here I do argue
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:37.340]   though that I people I know who are not either journalists or in tech like
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:43.500]   don't necessarily put misinformation and Facebook together immediately like they
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:47.500]   they trust Facebook they don't they don't read this they don't care they don't
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.740]   care they don't care I think people I think people have a good understanding
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.740]   that I mean I get I understand what you're saying actually like when oh I don't
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:00.100]   know you should see my my timeline before I quit was just full of people who
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:05.460]   were convinced that you know these crystals were gonna cure their COVID or
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:09.620]   whatever and that's the other thing so remember you know the whole thing of
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.220]   people would post something on Facebook and you'd look at it you'd be like are
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.620]   you kidding like how are people debating this and like one of your friends would
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:18.860]   put like the Snopes link and like nobody even cares they don't even like
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:22.700]   they're still debating it even with like the you know they don't care that's a
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:26.860]   that's a problem they don't they don't care so let's let's talk turkey here what
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:32.100]   would be the potential remedies so there's put the company up there's massive
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:40.460]   fines Leo is anyone in the chat coming up with any ideas let's see no
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:47.940]   all right next let me look it's just it's such an impossible problem because
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:53.260]   you know the thing is is I completely understand that you know without if we
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:59.500]   had broken up Microsoft decades ago it would not have done the things that it
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:07.540]   did but I also argue that is there is there was alternatively there could have
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:12.380]   been ten tech companies that all competed with each other to make good
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:17.980]   products and we could have gotten to a similar albeit different place with 10
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:22.740]   different CEOs who make you know marginally less than what Bill Gates was
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.740]   making at Microsoft it's it's my strong opinion that the DOJ actually at Microsoft
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:33.940]   had very beneficial impacts that they didn't need to break up Microsoft a
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:37.660]   micro did a tooth I mean we wouldn't have a Google if that if they hadn't
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:43.060]   intervened but because of that we got the innovation that second wave of
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:48.380]   innovation in the 2000s and I also think that Microsoft was forced to
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:53.300]   reconsider its its goals and they've pivoted and it's been good for Microsoft
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:59.380]   Microsoft is a better company now than it was in 1998 so I don't I think that
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.940]   whatever happened with the DOJ and Microsoft and as long as it went on it
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:09.020]   was in though it was absolutely beneficial it absolutely did the right
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:14.380]   thing I I'm hoping the same thing will happen with this I just I don't know what
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:21.220]   the answer is but I just think more people with good ideas deserve a shot at
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:26.660]   at having a great tech company and and I that's all I want and I don't know how
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.860]   to make that happen I don't think you can force it be doing something else
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:34.820]   right now but yeah it's just it's a hard it's a hard problem it's a hard problem
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:38.900]   it's a hard problem I mean it's not that there's no room for new winners to bubble
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:42.820]   up no I mean who'd heard a tick-tock a couple years ago I mean it still can
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:47.820]   happen if the idea is good enough tiktocks if you don't want to sell your idea to a
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:53.580]   major company more than likely you're not going to be a tiktock you're gonna get
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:56.580]   crushed you're gonna get copied and you're gonna get crushed yeah but tiktocks
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.460]   not trying to get tired well but how did tiktock do it I mean they yeah you know
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:04.140]   they were able to bubble up in this environment and break out in a way that
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:10.100]   we haven't seen that's an anomaly I think we're gonna see that yeah it's not
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.980]   gonna happen very often you know and that's the thing but when it happens I
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:17.620]   mean look at tiktock is is a force to be reckoned with I mean so it's not it's
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:20.860]   not something that does happen every day you know but it but it can still
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:24.580]   happen is is I just argue it should happen more like we should have more
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:27.980]   competition there is no competitor there's no natural competitor for
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:33.300]   Instagram name one right there's there's none there's literal I've looked but
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:38.700]   there's also a history of government intervention that has killed
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:42.140]   competition all you have to do is look at internet service providers in the
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:47.740]   United States and the duoples that are in most communities thanks to the FCC to
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:51.260]   realize that government intervention isn't always the solution it could
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:55.780]   actually make the problem worse yeah but it's just it's not good the way it is
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:59.900]   now so it's just you know why not try something else to me I guess it's not
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:03.460]   the monopoly that Facebook is or even their any competitive behavior that
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:09.500]   scares me it's the dominant position they have in the culture and I really I
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:14.100]   think if marmination info yeah I mean I don't think Mark would do this but but
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:20.140]   we don't know what if Mark Zuckerberg decided I want this to happen I think
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:28.300]   he has the dials and switches to do it he's got the most powerful mass medium in
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:34.300]   the history of mankind easily better than any television network any movie
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:40.220]   company I was watching it's a great movie mank the Netflix very good isn't it
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.820]   great it's black and white shot like it was in the 30s is a story of the writing
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:48.580]   of citizen gain and at one point Herman Mankowitz who's the you know
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:53.060]   protagonist in the in the movie Gary old man Gary old man's brilliant by
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.780]   fabulous good goes you know Louis B. Mayer's given him a hard time and he
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:04.420]   talked to Irving Thalberg movie guy he says you know what the the issue is that
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:10.500]   Upton Sinclair a socialist is running for governor and mayor doesn't want him
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.420]   William Randall first doesn't want him and mankowitz says what are you worried
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:19.500]   about you control a movie studio you can kill this guy's candidacy and a light
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:23.060]   goes on and Irving Thalberg's brain he says oh my god that's right we'll just
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:28.380]   make a bunch of phony newsreels that lie about the candidate and they and they
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:32.780]   of course they were very very successful that's nothing compared to what Facebook
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:37.340]   could do and not just in the US but with two and a half billion people all over
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:41.980]   the world they've been used by despots and dictators in the Philippines and
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:47.060]   Myanmar they clearly are the most powerful medium ever the human there's
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:52.140]   nothing and there's a stop hit them from if Mark Zuckerberg decided he wanted to
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:56.500]   run for president in 2024 he could do it he could do it and there's nothing
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.420]   stopping Facebook he from omitting negative stories about him he could have
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.460]   elected him he could have elected anybody he wanted president in 2020 he
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:11.180]   really could to his credit he didn't mess with the dials but the fact that he
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:15.660]   didn't doesn't mean like Twitter went the extra step and was like just no
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:19.700]   political ads like it's just there's there are ways you can take the extra
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:25.300]   step and there was just a choice to that's risky too because because and by the
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:29.940]   way political ads are coming back to Google as of this week but that's risky
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.980]   too because there's another there's still an election going on right big
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:38.180]   election in Alabama and it it I'm sorry Georgia and it's really always an
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:42.940]   election going on but it's really important that the smaller candidates the guy
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:47.340]   running for dog catcher doesn't have a big TV budget these are these ads are
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:54.220]   for many people the only way they can reach their voters so it's not I was
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.420]   for this you know and I got talked out of this on this week in Google Jeff
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.380]   Jarvis and a year nuts because I said all political ads should be banned on
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:04.420]   Facebook and Twitter and said you can't do that that disenfranchises the little
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.300]   guy the big guy has you can limit TV you can you can put a cap on it cap on
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:12.460]   spending maybe say only a certain amount of money should can be spent like I mean
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:17.100]   that's for for both candidates across their entire like you don't see you don't
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.380]   tell them how to spend it you say hey look here's your cap this is how much each
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:24.020]   candidate spends based on your district based on you know how many
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.060]   constituents you have how you know whatever that is there's a calculation
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:31.900]   I'm sure that yeah that would never fly though of course not it's a
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:36.540]   it's a constant violation of the Constitution for one thing right Leo it's
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:41.340]   what's interesting is that the the states complaint they have all these
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:45.540]   problems with Facebook's power except that one right the one thing they don't
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.980]   mention is there is their mass influence and in sort of if you step
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:55.940]   back from all of this what's happened with these giant tech giants is sort of
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:01.220]   consumerism capitalism run to its logical extreme that's right you know it's the
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:05.860]   same thing with climate change is the same thing with the wealth in equity
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:10.580]   like it's like there are cracks appearing in the big Central American
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:15.020]   concept and that's the theory and I don't know what the answer is right that's
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:19.460]   too many is exactly right exactly right all right let's take a little we've
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:23.580]   terrified ourselves we need what were you talking before the show that on the
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:26.660]   local news they have that the thing at the end the kicker that makes it really
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:39.020]   good you've seen your who skates yeah yeah you get the roller skates out because
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:47.380]   we need them our show today we need a moment we have I need a moment I need a
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:53.380]   moment I need the roller skates only thing that will is a panacea for this my
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:19:00.300]   wife has acquired a number a large number of cat hats from Etsy and has
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:07.740]   slowly been putting on a cat on the hat on the cat and and then I have to run in
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:11.340]   because she's holding the cat down I have to run and take a picture so she
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:16.500]   could post it on Instagram and somebody had a very I think a very good comment
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:22.140]   on the last one it was a Samantha wearing an aviators cat with her ears
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:26.580]   sticking out and the gla and they the comment was symbols to emoji was the
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:31.180]   poop emoji in the shoe emoji and as anybody's ever owned cats they know
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:37.820]   exactly what that means right revenge revenge she didn't poop in the shoes but
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:42.380]   she did poop in the bathtub so I figured that's a warning shot that's a shot
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:47.740]   across the bow you don't ever put a hat on me again what will we won't put up
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:53.420]   with that huh you know not a fan of clothing and hats no most cats aren't
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:58.540]   my wife unfortunately follows some Instagram which has a lot of cats in
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:04.380]   hats and and I think it's given her the notion that somehow you can convince
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:09.340]   cats to wear hats does this look like a happy cat does this look like a cat
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:13.420]   that's about the cat looks deeply concerned I agree with Jack I feel this
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:19.500]   cat is about to poop in my bathtub I don't know why I just yeah deep this cat
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:25.020]   looks deeply concerned that's the comment deeply concerned I do appreciate
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.980]   that it's just crocheted it's not like oh yeah too fussy it's like soft it's not a
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:39.580]   fussy hat okay are I just I look forward every morning when I get up to

[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:07.580]   to you by cent desk you know I think it's no question in my mind that a
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:13.020]   company does well when they say the most important thing is serving our customers
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:17.340]   customer service is everything and you know that because if you've called your
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.980]   bank and been put in hold and or you know if you if you if you
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.700]   called a uber and it didn't show up anytime you get bad customer service
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.420]   you go ugh ugh ugh sometimes it's a little hard

[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:44.940]   shoes were delayed by zappos by a day and tony sent them each a personal email
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:48.540]   and he said if you're on we're going to get you those we're going to FedEx them

[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:39.740]   apple headphones the air pods max he says heavy is the head that wears the
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:45.340]   earpods max have you tried them anybody tried them yet
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:49.260]   anybody got a cut got a pair of you can't at this point if you tried to buy
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:54.060]   them uh you'd be kind of out of luck because uh i think the delivery date is
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.660]   well after christmas now i think it's sometime in february
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:01.580]   they sold out very quickly as as apple apple stuff often
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:05.100]   uh does so i think that you know the really the only question that matters
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.460]   with headphones is do they sound good
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:13.100]   but we won't know that good can good sound 500 yeah what is it five hundred
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:18.300]   fifty dollars good how how good can that possibly sound i just i don't i can't
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:22.940]   wrap my head around it well good news you wrap around your head
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:27.580]   yeah that's right you put them on top here 385 grams worth
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:31.900]   the earlier viewers say that they sound fantastic yeah that the noise canceling
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:38.220]   is fantastic yeah but not 200 more fantastic right in the sony
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:43.020]   mx3's or mx4's a bose quiet comfort or a bunch of other i love them
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:47.500]   like i love my bow see this is this is an apple move and it's you know look
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:51.660]   it's people that love apple that are the upper echelon of their customers the
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:54.300]   frequent flyers the business people the people with a lot of
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:57.180]   disposal and that's why i don't trust early reviews because those are the
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:01.180]   people we're going to say because it's it's a confirmation bias well i spent
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.420]   five hundred fifty dollars on them they must sound good
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:06.700]   they're from apple they're beautiful they must sound good
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:10.220]   i don't trust that i and i'm and i'm sure they do sound good i don't i'm not
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:13.260]   debating the sound i'm sure they're great i mean apple you know they
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:17.740]   when they come out with something it does it usually lives up to the hype um
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:21.740]   you know the two hundred dollar price tag extra that you're paying on top of
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.540]   these things like i remember when i bought my bose noise canceling headphones this
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:28.140]   was ten years ago even that's one of the trick yeah it was like
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:31.740]   you know japan and i was like i need you know these are so expensive like oh my
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:35.420]   gosh and it'd been great you know 350 at the time seemed insane
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:39.100]   550 divide that by a couple of plane flights when you start you know flying
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:42.540]   again and you're a frequent traveler and you're an iPhone person and you have
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:48.540]   air pods you know it's you're going the the 400 let's say it's a buck 43 a gram
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:52.460]   it's expensive it's expensive but i would like to
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:56.220]   i would like to hear you know like you're weighing them out my gram and price
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:00.940]   like as if it's at the supermarket it's a buck 43 a little tail there
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.540]   and you're like you're like a shovel like you're just like all right you want
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:08.940]   you want an extra okay David's got his hand raised i would like to
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:12.940]   formally object to everybody saying that the price of the apple air pods max
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:15.980]   which is what they're called our five hundred and fifty dollars
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:22.860]   these headphones incredibly do not have an input there's no wire
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:28.140]   you cannot plug this into a seat back on an airplane yeah oh no you could
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:32.540]   unless but it's not quite apples adapter right for 35
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:36.940]   right so the price of the air pods max is correctly said to be
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.740]   five hundred and eighty five that's a good point if you want to wear them on a
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:42.060]   camera you're not you're not plugging them in you're using your
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:47.100]   iPad pro uh to watch a movie you're not plugging these things into anything
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:51.980]   you're using your beautiful brand new macbook air with m1 chip
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:55.500]   well that and that was it by the way another complaint that Gruber had
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.860]   these things have that thing apple called spatial audio
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:02.460]   but there's there's no it doesn't work with the apple tv apparently
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:05.820]   it only works he says so i have to watch this movie on my
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.260]   iPad he said it'd be fine if i were on airplanes all the time but i'm not
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.420]   on airplanes i don't believe he asked to watch a movie
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:16.140]   i want to watch it on my tv
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:21.180]   yeah okay also talk about the case yeah that's exactly what i was gonna say
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:26.460]   also it looks like a procedure for your headphones
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:31.820]   what the hell is that it's not it's not properly a case he puts it next to the
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:36.140]   bow's hard shell which is a real case these are just to expose the top of
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:42.940]   these things yeah look apple if anything apple has been
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:47.100]   known to have beautifully engineered things that are very clever
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:53.740]   and it strikes me as absolutely bananas that these don't fold up as small as
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:57.260]   humanly possible and have a beautiful little case
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:01.740]   like that does something i like it blows my mind actually
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:05.900]   and as mark has probably been a way third party accessories
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:12.620]   cases this this case protects the part that's made of steel and aluminum
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:17.740]   it doesn't need protecting it's the mesh part that needs protection
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:21.420]   protected i don't know if it protects anything
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:27.180]   um it is a uh so-called smart case it's magnetic so
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.020]   the headphones power there is no on off switch because it's an apple product
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:33.500]   i'm just thinking about plumbers as i'm looking at
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:37.740]   it does yeah are you saying that's a plumber crack are you saying that
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:42.620]   uh it looks uh now i'm never gonna unsee that i can i'm
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:48.540]   unsettled i can never unsee that now you've done it yeah thank you very much
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:53.820]   but here's what's incredible you guys when the air pods came out
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:57.180]   everybody made fun of them says that was like a floss
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.580]   you know we're gonna buy them anyway not me it doesn't matter how stupid it
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:05.180]   looks or how badly conceived there's no way i'm buying this
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:09.260]   it's got to come down and it's got to fold up i i i like at least you know it's
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:13.980]   like these folds flat i love the the bows folds flat but man i just
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.940]   got to fold i'm not against i'm gonna travel with them i mean that's
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:21.020]   i'm not against uh spending a lot of money on headphones because
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:24.060]   headphones you can spend a lot of money on headphones
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:27.180]   get really great headphones and they'll still be cheaper than an expensive
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:31.260]   stereo so i have in fact a very expensive pair of
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:35.180]   hi-fi man headphones that i can listen to audio file
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:39.260]   high quality music um and it costs more frankly
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:43.900]   but what you're not paying for audio quality on these you're paying for an
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:50.220]   accelerometer and and microphones and an apple watch style knob and
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:53.100]   i don't know if you're paying for audio quality on this i don't think that
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:57.420]   they're you know they're not using uh planar magnetic or any of the fancy
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:01.260]   stuff and it really bothers me that you know it's really a wireless pair of
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:05.580]   headsets so that's by definition not audio file
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:09.340]   i do love i will say this there is one feature about this that i think is
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.380]   really uh it's very apple-esque it's very clever
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:16.700]   and and i would like to see it across every pair of wireless
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:20.780]   battery powered headsets uh when i take them off i just want them shut off
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:23.260]   right when i when i put them back on i want them to turn on
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:25.740]   like that's what you're back for is the circuitry
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:28.220]   that seems this thing that seems very good this thing
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:31.260]   is what was it a six-core processor in each
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:36.380]   copper? remember when our giant computers used to not have that
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:41.180]   like that's so weird to me i remember building a computer in college and
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:44.780]   like it was like a Pentium II or something i was just like yeah i think
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:48.460]   about it just like wow i remember i used to work at like
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.420]   office depot you could you'd sold that sell the chips that you could like
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:55.340]   pop out and put the new end you know the new Pentium
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:59.980]   this seluron if you pop it out you can get the next generation pop it right in
[01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.740]   and uh you'll get some real improvement why can't i just buy an m1 from apple
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:09.340]   just switch it out when i was a kid we had one processor and we were happy
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:13.340]   here's my favorite thing about the earpods max i can't wait till the next
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:16.700]   version when they tell us all the bad things about the first version
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.580]   yeah you know this first version didn't have this in this in this way
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.220]   oh yeah i know it's terrible thing to do last time
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:25.020]   what were you gonna say David Ashley i think the thing that you were talking
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:28.940]   about is a knock against it i mean yes apparently you can just pull a
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:32.140]   couple away and say what oh yes uh what an
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:36.460]   atomic but but the no power thing is a real problem because
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:40.060]   you can't shut the power off without putting it all the way
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:44.140]   into the case right so do you just want to take a break it's a huge problem
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.500]   otherwise it sits there on your tray table using up battery power
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.900]   see i hate that it might be smart enough to
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:53.820]   like the concept of like if you take it off i just want it to shut off and then
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.220]   if you put them on i want them to turn back on i don't
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:01.180]   god the case thing is terrible but yeah i want i want that in all headphones that
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:03.900]   i have that are battery power they're chargeable
[01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:07.420]   yeah i mean the music does that the music pauses when you take it off and put it
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:11.580]   on but the but the headphones and sellers that's that's why again i watch
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:14.700]   marquez's video he says you take them off you put them on the table
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:19.260]   they keep running for two hours so i don't know oh that's not good well
[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:23.660]   yeah but you get 20 i mean unless you're on a really long flight you know i mean
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:26.540]   well there should be a way you could turn up the
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:30.540]   go to sleep you know turn down the go to sleep time two hours they might be
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:34.220]   able to do that in a software update honestly yeah they might give that to you
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:38.700]   in a software like a you know it when not in use shut off after
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:43.180]   and then you can set it the way you do your your screen on your iphone i i
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:46.780]   would say that what you are paying for is
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:53.260]   you know the h1 chip in each ear with six cores the eight microphones for noise
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.140]   cancellation the three microphones for voice pickup
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:00.060]   the accelerometer the optical sensor in each cup
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:04.940]   the the position sensor the this there's a lot of technology
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:09.900]   but do you argue that 11 microphones might be one or two microphones to
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:14.300]   money i don't know i don't know i have to trust apple
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:17.820]   they seem to imagine a little making headphones 11
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:23.500]   microphones 11 give them to you for free at that point because they're
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:27.260]   harvesting so much you're personal data rich you get you get it's a hundred
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:31.500]   dollars per microphone and they get the other six free
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:37.660]   um it's so apple we so apple so apple very apple and you're going to see
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:42.220]   them everywhere i mean are you yes yes you are well you can't get them Leo you
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:46.620]   said you can't get them they're sold out everywhere yeah
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:50.140]   johnny i was probably going to wear them and is cool like fancy what is it a
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.300]   Bentley that he rides around i don't know whatever i
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:56.060]   remember that actually you better stop driving in a Bentley because apparently
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:35:01.580]   johnny i've an apple cfo luka mace you're in uh the running to be the next ceo
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:08.300]   Ferrari is that a plum job i i don't know would you leave
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:15.580]   apple as coo to take a job as ceo Ferrari i can see johnny i've do it and he's
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:20.940]   got nothing to do but i don't know that's so weird i mean he really likes
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:25.180]   lug i mean he loves luxury cars so that seems like a thank you
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:28.940]   he would be sensitive yeah he makes sense like it's not just taking a ceo job to
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:32.220]   take a ceo job that's something you do when you get really
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:37.020]   rich you start to love luxury cars i'll never understand i never know
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:42.780]   i never know you love two things you love the airpods max and luxury in your
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:47.180]   cari yeah and first first-class travel
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:53.020]   Ferrari's this is from ux collective ux design that
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:58.860]   cc apple versus google in ten honest graphics
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:03.740]   one decision making google gives you lots of choices then points to the one
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:07.020]   you want apple just says nope you're getting square
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:12.700]   airpod maxes on your head period uh in research and development
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:18.060]   uh google i don't know what these i don't know what these phallic symbols
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:21.340]   i don't know these phallic symbols mean i don't know there's x's i think it's
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:25.500]   basically like they do so google tends to they actually will launch stuff
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:29.340]   as opposed to like research research research and then launch one thing
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:33.420]   google will launch a bunch of things and then use that as their you know
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:36.780]   they'll just develop a bunch of products they throw a bunch of spaghetti against
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.140]   the wall and then the but apple says no no no
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:43.340]   x's are uh messaging platforms like google is
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:49.660]   right there that's it alo yeah what's the other two alo hang hangouts
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:55.420]   uh meet we'll see we got chat wave number goog wave plus
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:59.980]   wave plus i mean there's just so many to choose from apple puts all its wood
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:03.100]   behind one arrow or phallic symbol in this case
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:06.860]   google has many phallic symbols i see the apple one looks like it just a middle
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:10.300]   finger just kind of it's like nice this is right
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:15.420]   finger graphic there view of consistency apple
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:19.100]   is consistency focused on user experience google is consistency
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:23.820]   focused on visual consistency consistency for consistency's sake
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:27.900]   i think that's this clearly now we know ux design is all about apple
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:32.700]   products pre-announcement google press releases and teasers apple
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:37.500]   shh shh shh i mean that should just be a bucket leaking
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:41.980]   instead of a lock yeah i mean i don't argue that apple graphic is a little
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:44.860]   true anymore no apple we can do everything
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:49.020]   yeah we knew everything uh well in fact apple even announces stuff six months
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:53.100]   in advance now yeah yeah which kind of disappointed me
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:56.380]   i think that's a mistake in general to talk too much about what's coming
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:00.540]   house oh how so how so well at wwdc they
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:05.020]   they unveil all the new stuff that the new watch will have new you know
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:09.340]   then you can't i guess the argument is they got to get developers to work on it
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:14.380]   prior to releasing it yeah yeah i agree though i think it's a mistake
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:19.100]   you know they announced the uh mac pro two years before it came out
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:24.220]   i think that's perhaps a record and then what about the air pad universal
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:29.020]   charger they have never oops never an old air pad
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:33.820]   uh they never did announce apple tags did they that's just rumored but
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:38.140]   it's yeah continuing forever forever a long time
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:43.020]   um apple is working on its own cellular modem
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:47.900]   uh to replace the qualcom part i'm sure apple wants to get rid of everything
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:54.620]   it has to buy from qualcomer or uh until jonnie syrugy says they've got in-house
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:58.940]   efforts they said this in the in-house town hall meeting but to your point
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.620]   actually it leaked out immediately
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:08.060]   some lock so there you go there here's some interesting Leo did you know
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:11.740]   everybody says that apple is making their own chips now right right
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:14.860]   doesn't that suggest to you that they make their own chips
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:18.220]   that they have a fab no but they in fact do not make their own chips
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:21.900]   t's not makes them it's all made in Taiwan yeah
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:25.980]   yeah well that's but Taiwan semiconductor makes 50 percent
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:31.100]   of the world's chips for everybody all the brand names apple is designing them
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.580]   right from you know designing california
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:38.140]   designed and made in Taiwan yeah uh but no that's a good point they don't
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:42.060]   make their own chips but they're but they're using their own chips
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:46.460]   that's fair right yeah yeah i do you have you got an m1 yet
[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:50.140]   david no i haven't i actually ordered it
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:55.580]   the macbook pro one and then i'm like wait two usb jacks yeah down from the
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:59.660]   four i have now and that's when twitter schooled me and said
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:03.420]   pog you idiot the one that they're selling now is the equivalent of the
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:07.020]   low end it's the low end model that they used to have not even pro it's a great
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:11.820]   till the spring you get the m2 on the high end mac pro you can i
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:17.420]   am yeah i actually got it and i love it i love it but what you do find out
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:20.380]   immediately is there are things that don't even run on a rosetta
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:24.540]   mostly weird edge case things yeah you have those programmer tools yeah a lot
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.500]   of dev tools don't you like your home brew and stuff
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:31.740]   but i can still use in a 2013 macbook pro retina because it has
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:36.940]   like very specific plug it has very specific ports that i need
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:41.420]   well yeah for video stuff for all of my like transfer like hard drives and
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:44.620]   everything i'm just like man i just don't want to transfer everything to usbc
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:48.540]   just i just carry a dongle with me everywhere david
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:52.140]   yeah but you know you've you've evolved right i listened to a
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:55.740]   twit where you you went on a rant about how overrated
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:41:00.700]   snappiness is that who cares about i was not a rant i think that's much too
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:05.260]   much to say i was trying to make people feel better
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:09.340]   who don't have an m1 yet
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:15.100]   oh no merely to say that a lot of what you see at least initially what you saw
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:20.540]   about m1 these geek bench and other kind of synthetic benchmarks
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:25.740]   aren't really reflecting real world use and it is true it is snappier but
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:29.980]   ultimately do you care if it is one bounce or two bounces
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:34.460]   on the dock before an app launches i don't think that's a
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:39.420]   quality of life game changer however having had the m1 now for a little
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:42.140]   bit longer it's pretty snappy
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:45.580]   [laughter]
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:51.180]   you've evolved it's snappy i just i don't want people to feel bad if their
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:55.500]   machine isn't snappy anymore i mean actually you love your ancient
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:59.340]   mac because oh i didn't say i loved it i said i have to use it i have not
[01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:03.580]   afraid of it i have a key and look yeah it's far this thing from snappy but
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.300]   it's got an hdmi port or whatever it is that you need
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:10.780]   yeah it has like can we just look at look at this
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:16.540]   i mean just look at all these ports guys you got hdmi on there you got your sd
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:20.300]   card yeah but it's the kids don't recognize those anymore
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:25.340]   i need all i need these parts what's that hdmi port for
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:30.380]   so i have a different philosophy on that you got all those built in you're
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.940]   carrying them around the additional weight the additional bulk the
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:36.940]   additional thickness all the time even when you don't need those ports i would
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:43.100]   prefer a slimmer simpler chassis and have a little dongle when i need them
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:47.100]   and not have to carry around all that extra baggage uh so this year in
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:50.140]   quarantine like that's kind of what i've done yeah i'm actually just i'm working
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:56.700]   on a pc now i just built a pc and um i'll be able to put together a nice
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:01.580]   well mini itx case you got an rtx 3080 in there you got one of them i wish it
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:06.620]   won't fit i got i have a i have a nzxt manta case so it just it will not fit
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:10.620]   well you should have bought a bigger case how you gonna play cyberpunk 2077
[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:14.300]   on that day i'll call it on ps5 come on leo i played on console um
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:19.020]   yeah no i i just uh i well i built this a couple years ago
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:23.180]   and so um i haven't upgraded the video card in it and now the cards are too big
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:25.900]   so now i might i just have to build an entire
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:30.700]   new computer but i i have been doing most of my video work on this and then i have
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:34.860]   my ipad pro with a with a pencil and that's like the other you know screen that i
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:38.620]   kind of use around the house because it's just the lightest easiest thing for me to take
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:45.420]   you know where i'm playing cyberpunk 2077 on my m1 mac and tasha man is it snappy
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:53.260]   no i i'm using google stadia to play it and uh in fact a number of people i heard this is a good way
[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:59.100]   to a number of people said it actually plays better on google stadia than on your xbox one or ps4
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:04.860]   uh you're playing it on ps5 you're not going to get 4k or any of that stuff this game's been
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:09.820]   they've been developing this game since yet 2012 iMac came out that you're using there
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:17.580]   a macbook game out um it's fun it's a fun game um what's your role leo i beg you for a
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:23.980]   corpo you roll corpo i did aren't you funny you pegged me so you get to pick at the beginning if
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:29.740]   you're gonna i don't know matter a street kid right corpo's in a but you learn very quickly when
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:35.740]   you're a corpo that you're not gonna be a corpo for very long there's a quick day new mall and
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:40.620]   you're suddenly out in the street so it didn't really didn't really matter it's grand theft auto
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:47.660]   in a very big open universe in the in the future yeah it's a future gta basically but it's fun
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:54.620]   it's a nice game are you play have you played it yeah it's glitchy it's it's glitchy and not snappy
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:45:02.540]   uh yeah not not nope there's some there's some interesting glitches i know uh my co-producer here
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:08.220]   in la logan he said there was a scene where you're supposed to get a chip put in your head or some
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:14.060]   chip put in someone else's head yeah and uh he it was a gun like a bitch instead it was just
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:19.100]   no don't put a gun in your head like i had a gun installed in my head which is like very funny um
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:24.300]   that made me laugh very hard and then uh my husband's been playing it on his computer and uh
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:30.060]   all of the palm trees keep popping to the foreground all the trees keep popping to the foreground it's
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:34.940]   very weird um i've seen a couple other ones on twitter where it's like a woman walks through a
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:40.140]   filing cabinet yeah there's a lot of weird glitches there's that weird one about like the
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:45.420]   the people's junk like showing there's a clipping issue where there's a lot of uh junk is showing
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:50.060]   through there's a lot of junk in this isn't there a lot of junk yeah i haven't gotten to that part
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:57.740]   yet um now i'm just in the tutorial here uh but i think stadia by the way i'm playing this in a browser
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:04.860]   on a computer that's far far away pretty amazing right it's a good proof of concept because
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:10.940]   this is a obviously very challenging game i'm not playing it on hardware that's this is like
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:15.580]   the original surface studio this is a pig of a machine doesn't matter because none of the
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:21.740]   works being done on the machine so microsoft's launching their own stadia rival x-class in the spring
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:27.260]   yeah yeah so i i know one of the one of the topics how that you know because that wasn't
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:33.180]   gonna work on the iphone and now they're doing that via browser on the iphone which is um you know i
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:36.140]   found that interesting because they have to kind of do that workaround because they wanted them to
[01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:40.780]   approve like every single game that would be streamed if it was to be not just to prove it i mean that's
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:46.140]   separate app for every game yeah separate app for every game and then each one of those had to be
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:51.420]   approved which is just not kind of well oh yeah that's how a cloud service works a cloud gaming
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:56.300]   service yeah so the argument which i think is a good argument microsoft's decided not to make it
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:47:00.220]   by the way they didn't go the epic root and sue and everything but the argument is how is this
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:05.420]   different than netflix uh it's a streaming game i'm streaming and moving i'm streaming a game
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:10.140]   there's no difference but but anyway apples yeah there's a good end because it competes with apple
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:15.100]   arcade Leo that's the real reason of course that's the reason yeah well what is netflix they've got
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:21.980]   apple tv plus i you know i don't know maybe apple is in everything now yeah remember when apple
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:27.740]   when they took their name they said oh you know apple never do music well never do music don't worry
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:35.340]   beetles we're gonna do music yeah don't worry beetles they have done everything yeah uh i have a
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:42.060]   theory on streaming stuff so i think stadia google stadia was waiting for cyberpunk 2077 it was it's
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:46.780]   just been it's been around for a while but i think this is going to be the big launch and i think
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:52.220]   it's interesting that in some cases it's actually a better experience than on your own hardware like
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:48:01.980]   an xbox one or playstation four um and i don't think it's for either microsoft or google it has
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:09.820]   anything to do with gaming i think a it's a proof of concept that you know that their cloud is amazing
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:17.420]   but especially for microsoft i think what microsoft's saying is well if you can run cyberpunk 2077
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:25.020]   what about windows what about office why i mean if you can do a game in real time over the internet
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:31.420]   could you could you do uh run your entire business run your entire business yeah i think that's a
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:38.940]   real point a month yeah a screen yeah yeah i i would like that idea direction right yes they call it
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:46.620]   windows vd yeah uh which is a terrible name that seems like a bad well we're gonna inject you with
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:52.620]   windows without that it's windows vd it stands for windows virtual that's not but i think they
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:59.900]   probably will rename it once they realize what they've done um it'll be windows s t d s t d much
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:08.300]   better simulated straight to desktop there it is you got it perfect windows s t d yeah how are these
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:14.620]   virtual cloud based console games even possible like anyone who's ever tried this mind together
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:21.260]   yeah over zoom yeah like there's a latency issue you can't just wish that away it's amazing i don't
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:25.980]   like push a program in the controller you program in the lag is a feature right so it's like you
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:32.060]   you just assume it's there maybe i mean with a game especially game like this where you're
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:37.340]   shooting things you're dodging things i mean that's where you put a chip in your ear and it turns
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:42.940]   out to be a cup of coffee that's that's what latency will do for you i'm not sure what how
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:47.500]   they're getting around this you certainly have enough to have enough bandwidth you're magic of
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:52.620]   some kind um that's actually really good question david it's probably i mean the bandwidth is probably
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:58.060]   one aspect but the latency of your connection i think that's why this whole 5g idea yeah is so
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:02.540]   important because the latency is improved and i think that's what does unlock a lot of these
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:08.060]   things in the future like the even you know the windows vd whatever you're saying you know it's like
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:12.060]   the latency is really almost more important at this point like people people are sitting there
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:17.020]   they email me like rich you know my my internet's buffering i've got you know 200 down from spectrum
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:21.420]   and it's buffering i know i can't watch Netflix i'm like you know you realize Netflix needs like
[01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:25.340]   five megabits per second yeah i mean yeah perfectly what's going on i don't know
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:29.660]   so what do we try something yes let's do something that's never been on twit
[01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:35.420]   twit before okay okay um i assume all of you have decent speeds i am i'm paying for 200 megabits
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:40.140]   down and it might have okay yes so if you could cut to the broad view of all four screens
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:46.060]   or all three screens in the new i'm going to say one two three clap at that speed everyone clap
[01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:49.100]   on one two three clap ready one two three clap
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:59.100]   it's no way only we can score it but it's not going to do that wait a minute we got to do that
[01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:05.180]   again that was awful let's all sing happy birthday no one two three clap one two three clap
[01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:14.300]   wait that was really off we had two cues there yeah we had two cues rich and i live and die by the
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:19.340]   cues so now first yeah we know's vd and now we got the clap i don't know what's going on in this show
[01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:26.220]   you do dive in live tv i mean it's it's a nightmare the delay so you know i do these station
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:30.380]   talkbacks and yeah actually you've done them Leo we've done them but it's like you know when i'm
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:36.060]   hearing in my ear is like three seconds quicker than what you see on tv i mean it's such a nightmare to
[01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:40.540]   like try to you know and when you see it on tv i'm sitting there like i'm bobbing my head for like
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:44.620]   three seconds people are like what what's the why is this guy talking yet like i've heard what
[01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:49.100]   you said and i started talking as soon as you stop the one chance that covid has given us which
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:56.140]   is we all understand a little bit better that because everybody's got lag and you if you watch
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:52:01.500]   any news at all because everybody's coming from their house now it's just like you're getting we
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:06.540]   all kind of used to the zoom effect i think that is one one thing we're going to come out of the
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:12.460]   quarantine with some information about so which did you choose street kid you looked like a street
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:17.900]   kid Ashley oh come on Leo i went corporal give me a minute you did too i totally did oh that's
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:24.380]   hysterical yeah so street kid no mad i don't know i'm gonna start a new game because i'm bored
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:29.660]   now you're reaching out this is gonna get this could get graphic very quickly no there's no nudity
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:34.940]   in this i actually have a i've got the stadium they sent it to me you know for free from the uh
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:39.980]   i was you know for what was it like youtube premiere whatever i have my youtube subscription
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:43.180]   they said oh do you want to stadia and i ordered it but i've never played it but now that you're
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:48.540]   talking up this game oh yeah well you have to buy the games are 60 bucks sure yeah yeah that's that's
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:52.700]   how they get you yeah i was talking to my brother i was like this is free to play on stadia he's like
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:53:00.780]   no yeah if you but if you don't have stadia i believe right now if you if you buy cyberpunk through it
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:07.500]   they will they're a central yeah they send you a stadium which is great i did that to me so now i'm
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:12.140]   gonna have two stadia i'm gonna open up an ebay when stadia was and now i've started i bought the
[01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:16.620]   stadia pro kit and then i canceled it i thought i don't want that this was almost seems like a year
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:20.300]   ago i don't want that but then the cyberpunk thing says i said all right all right i'm gonna buy
[01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:26.140]   the game they send you the controller and a chromecast ultra because the new google google tv thing
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:32.060]   doesn't work i'm so ridiculous so i was gonna actually ask about that so is my i haven't opened
[01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:38.060]   the box yet is the chromecast in the box as well with the chromecast aller yeah and i can't use my
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:42.860]   chromecast tv which is so ridiculous in fact you can't use any other controller with it either
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:47.660]   you have to have that one to punch and then you could play it but you could play it in a big screen
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:53.020]   tv it actually looks really great yeah um you could play it on anything you can't get your hands on a
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:54:00.220]   ps5 right now or an xbox series x for the holidays like this is a good way to experience it because
[01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:06.620]   as leo mentioned if you're playing on a standard ps4 or an xbox one it's gonna look like you have
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:12.460]   everything on the lowest settings it just looks not great it plays not great either so and even you
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:19.900]   know even a ps4 pro is like gonna there's some struggle there honestly and i don't i don't think
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:26.380]   this was planned but this is the best case scenario for stadia uh i think this is going to put stadia
[01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:31.020]   on the map and it's actually that's good news for microsoft because they're xcloud and vidia has
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:36.140]   g force now they've been doing this for a while sony bought guy chi so they could they've been doing
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:42.300]   this streaming gaming everybody's doing streaming gaming now and it's it's we're in this weird
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:46.940]   period i even thought this when apple came out with its new macintosh computers based on its own
[01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:52.860]   silicon we're in this period where owning your own hardware is rapidly becoming like owning
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:59.500]   your own cds or books everything reliability it's it's you're gonna move to streaming to physical
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:06.220]   i think physical product is yeah so we're in this i mean inter-remember buying you would you would
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:11.420]   want to have a collection of things and i talked about this on my podcast it's like you i used to be
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:16.300]   building a collection of something was amazing you know whether it was books or cds or movies or
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:23.500]   blue rays and as you know everything it's to me i don't even want anything anymore like i why
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.900]   wouldn't i not just pay the ten dollars a month and i know i get it not everyone wants to do that but
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:31.580]   it just seems so much easier like i you know if i want to listen to the new tailor swift thing
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:37.020]   that i see everyone tweeting about i can just do that in a second um yeah you know i don't have to
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:44.860]   deal with all the i know leo i i see you you i i bet you've got the server of your movies right yeah
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:49.820]   plex yeah yeah see i know i but i don't want to do that it's like that's an archive i don't even want
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:55.420]   to do that you're not collecting anything you're an archivist you're here it's archival yeah even
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:56:00.060]   that is old i always love that idea of just you know having all this stuff you know like i own
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:04.540]   this like but then i'm like i don't want any of it like and you can't especially when you move
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:12.140]   man you pack up those cds or those books you don't that's a nightmare right you know what else is a
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:18.380]   nightmare related to this topic i've got a blended family of five children there is nothing you can
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:23.260]   give these kids for christmas because there's no physical things i know you know i'm experiencing
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:29.980]   that for the first time too it's like i'm gonna give them a gift card a steamy card what i'll pay
[01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:35.420]   for three months of netflix for you yeah so what you end up giving them socks and no one walks socks
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:40.380]   no one is happy getting socks that's how i feel with my family it's like i'm like uh what do you
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:45.340]   want for christmas but it's like really the thing is is like everybody wants like an amazon gift card
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:50.380]   or a visa gift card it's like i'm just like okay well i just want to send that to you it's depressing
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:54.940]   i gotta say the one thing that apple did right this year and i think it's kind of a slower burn but
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:59.820]   that little home pod mini is like the perfect gift because it's it's a hundred bucks thank you if they
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:06.140]   have an iphone it's like clearly i will give that to everybody it's a great you know what how about this
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:12.300]   how about me too to try out as a stereo how do they sound it's really cool they do so very
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:18.460]   100 bucks total i opposite size of the room sounds good i bought one for my sister the second
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:23.260]   they sent me the review unit i i couldn't like really tell anyone but i literally ordered one
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:28.060]   this the next day that i could you know the first day i could i said you have to get this like you
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:31.900]   need this in your house and i bought it by the way she just got it today and i ordered it the first
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:36.460]   day it was available so i guess they are selling those so worst feeling in the world
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:44.060]   my son since he was 16 i've been giving him like socks and every single time he opens the
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:47.660]   present what is wrong with you man he's all kind of present are you it's so sad
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:53.020]   they're a great president i know they are yeah socks but a good sock every time i know he's in a pair
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:56.700]   of socks he's got his face is he's all excited he's opening his present he goes oh
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:06.380]   it's the worst it's the worst by the way stadia running i mean uh yeah cyberpunk 27
[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:13.980]   70 on stadia running on a galaxy fold how about that did sam saun have to approve that no i don't
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:21.180]   think so it's the stadia app yeah so and you can even use a screen as a touch controls although i
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:26.940]   don't know if that's the ideal way to do it um i have one of those weird things where you attach
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:32.460]   the phone and you can enjoy stick underneath it and you're well i have that for my switch so weird i
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:36.540]   have that for my antenna switch it's called a fixture s one s one no it's i think it
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:43.340]   they just did a liquid uh injected mold uh version i should get there because i'm really
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:50.380]   great my thumbs are starting to cramp up there it's you put the um the main part of your uh switch
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:56.380]   inside it and then it folds up yeah and then you put your pro controller yeah locks into the bottom
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:59:01.100]   half and um and then that way you have like an actual like controller and set your way cons
[01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:07.260]   did you buy your turnips today yet or i have not uh i have not checked in with i did check in with
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:15.180]   a i haven't checked in with dasie may i um but i did i did go and uh i built some

[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:43.020]   date for you but it's a different day for everybody because you can time travel for people but there
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:49.100]   were like three a second for like a long time i got so many star shards i can't wait to figure out
[01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:55.100]   what to do well then you gotta go talk to Celeste you gotta talk to me yes Celeste you meet Celeste
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:59.820]   got to get your diy's from Celeste get you get you yeah all right this could really go downhill
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:03.820]   we'll take it offline after we'll talk about animal crossing culture my mom got animal
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:09.660]   crossing i talked her into getting it like she was hesitant and she got a switch and animal crossing
[02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:17.180]   in october me too me too she has spent hundreds of hours in game yes yes and she just built a forced
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:23.020]   perspective village what with all houses my mom is better at animal crossing than i am this is
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:28.380]   over rage yeah because you can buy doll houses you can you buy as many as you want and build
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:34.300]   wait my mom's got animal crossing the main game is actually the best covid game
[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:40.540]   because it's a nice world where nothing bad is happening there's an ocean there's a moon
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:46.220]   there's sunshine the waves the sand the beach you can build a nice place you got a little animal
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:51.500]   friends that come by and visit uh do you do this though because everyone's want to come up and
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:56.300]   say i'm sick of my catchphrase you want to give me a new catchphrase do you give them
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:03.900]   evil catchphrases i don't because they're so nice oh i give them the worst catchphrases i
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:10.300]   seem to know yo we are learning a lot about you yeah you took a friendly game and you turned it
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:16.140]   twisted it into something oh but then every time you see them they say it it's so funny
[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:22.700]   all right let's uh we should do a thing the top 10 best covid games you've got two already cyber
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:29.420]   punk anything with a world that you can go into and immerse yourself in i think animal crossing is
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:34.780]   perfect it makes me think like the great british bakes baking show oh among us british baking
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:41.340]   sherry yeah what did you say David you i said in this household among us yeah that's the one right
[02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:46.780]   now that's everyone and do you play that with the kids i do yeah oh that's cool it's just
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:53.260]   the hours go by so and among us and i think people know by now but i'll just say for those of you
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:59.260]   who do not you are on a space it's really werewolf you're on a spaceship uh you have to keep the
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:03.740]   spaceship running you have tasks to fix things and you're with a team there's other people there
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:09.980]   the people your friends and family the real people and some of them though are imposters and their
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:14.140]   goal is to kill you one by one and you have to figure out who those people are and out them
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:19.820]   before they kill off the crew i bet it's a lot of figure out you got to figure out who's sus
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:26.140]   and you got to toss them out the airlock yeah yeah it's it's super fun because you know then then
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:30.540]   you have these meetings where you say okay i think it was leo and leo has to try to get into you
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:34.700]   right not just like werewolf it's basically yeah it is that game make money or assassin is that
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:37.980]   in real life my kids haven't hit me up for in-app purchases on that one yet
[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:43.980]   these are are there i don't think there are i think it's just paid on console but it's free on
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:52.860]   on mobile yeah you could play it on uh ios it's fun fall guys also very fun fall guy roblox
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:58.940]   uh jason and jatron saying roblox is a good one oh i banned roblox in my house did you it's
[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:02.940]   yeah it's isn't it good for kids because they're learning to build things
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:10.540]   ooh no no it's it's like it sounds like minecraft but it's not the games are not um no that sounds
[02:03:10.540 --> 02:03:16.700]   like a big fan of a lot of chiffon butter ad it sounds like roblox but it's not it's chiffon
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:20.940]   i can't believe it's not minecraft i can't believe it's not minecraft i can't believe it's
[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:25.340]   that's yeah that's basically yeah it's like it looks like it's like oh it's blocky it looks like
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:30.380]   they're building something no no there's literally like a murderous grandma chasing after your kids
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:34.540]   with a bludgeon you know that's why kids love that that's why kids love that yeah that's why they
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:39.980]   love it but you're making a list of the best co uh the best covid pandemic games yeah doesn't jackbox
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:46.060]   three dimension that's fun it's fun that's the trivia you don't know jack uh but it's no oh my god
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:50.140]   there's like 40 of them now and there's a bunch of games it looks like you can play against other
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:56.060]   people in their other homes yeah together it's not like among that we did that we did we do an
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:01.820]   after hours every once in a while we did a few of those yeah that's it's was pretty fun yeah um
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:06.940]   we're doing among us for my brother's birthday see i think that's really sweet
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:11.900]   that solves a problem the only way we can all be together you so you're not in the same room but
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:18.940]   you're doing each other yeah yeah that's the only way there's honestly i love werewolves so much that
[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:23.740]   i would go places to encourage people to play werewolf that you had to play in person because you
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:28.060]   know there's sounds and stuff and i just love it so i think i should probably play among us
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:32.620]   that sounds like sneaky stask watch is also another uh sneaky stask watch apple war
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:38.780]   that's a big covid game yeah that was like a breakout kind of apple arcade yeah yeah oh this has been a
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:44.220]   lot of fun let's take a little break we can i love this panel david pog is back with us it's been about
[02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:49.980]   four years since you visited 400 episodes ago his new book is coming out in january can you
[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:55.420]   i pre-ordered on amazon now you can and in fact is all your authors probably tell you
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:05:00.540]   that helps the author a lot because all the sales leading up to the release date count
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:05.500]   for the best seller lists as a single week so so you would suddenly jump to number one
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:11.980]   suddenly boom and i'll tell you what else this is something i i offered on twitter if you if you
[02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:17.020]   want if you're looking for a gift for someone who cares about the environment or just being safe yeah
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:25.420]   send me the receipt to pog at me dot com my email pog at me dot com and i will mail you an autographed
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:31.660]   book plate a sticker oh when it comes and so that way i think to wrap and put under the tree you don't
[02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:36.220]   have to wait till january for that now see here's an example that's brilliant i can order this on
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:42.860]   kindle but then where would i put the book plate so on your forehead on my forehead so i'm gonna
[02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:49.020]   get the paper bill even those twice as much as the kindle oh but you got did you read the audio
[02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:56.220]   book version i am i'm doing it right now this is day six we read one to five p.m. every day me and
[02:05:56.220 --> 02:06:03.340]   an engineer of on speakerphone were halfway through it is the hardest most exhausting heart
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:08.780]   it's so hard i would have done your audiobook just call me you do four hours you do four is that
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:15.020]   something you do actually i can talk for five hours a day for three weeks no easy easy and how
[02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:21.020]   comfortable are the air pods max that entire time do they fit nicely all you yeah yeah my head is
[02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:27.900]   like this it's like it helped me i think i would volunteer i would volunteer too that would be fun
[02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:33.180]   i'm gonna do audiobooks when i retire i think but do you say it's horrible it's it's terrible work
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:40.860]   it's it's shockingly deleted yeah i mean literally other than you Leo when in life does anyone
[02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:48.620]   speak performatively non-stop for four hours or eight hours like it's actors and it's you but no
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:56.060]   girl says if i was this is if i was made for this it is you'd be a good audiobook but i've done a
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:07:03.260]   couple audiobooks i did one when when you visited audible they had me do some weird little red
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:09.900]   writing hood take off his little golden writing hood it's still on amazon audible i think you get
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:15.900]   it for free yeah it was weird Leo if you could narrate any audiobook like your favorite book what
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:21.260]   would it be i like doing books with lots of characters so i can do a lot of voices so it would have to
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:26.860]   be something like krypton nomicon or yeah i'm gonna get into it game of thre
[02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:32.220]   a snow crash snow crash oh protagonist yeah but all of those have been done so maybe the next
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:36.940]   maybe the next Neil Stevenson novel or something you should have done right i should have gotten
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:44.220]   in on that 70s action on that love that i think though that you're right i because the other thing
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:51.020]   i did was Corey doctora once asked me to read a short story uh for uh he did a uh release a
[02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:56.140]   short stories that had a little chip on it that had everybody that famous people reading his book
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:01.580]   semi-famous in my case or less than famous infamous would probably the right word reading his book
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:07.020]   and that was hard because i was doing it on my own with the does the and what i experienced at
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:13.020]   the audible thing is the producers constantly at least for me saying slow down slow down slow down
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:20.140]   mine constantly interrupts me to say did you mean to say that and i'll say say what say what they
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:26.620]   said you just said the seized temperature has gone eight de moyne since 19th is
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:33.820]   i said that really green egg way bush the funny thing is that he asked you did you mean to say
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:40.220]   that like you might have no i meant de moyne no that's exactly what i admit so measurement
[02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:44.380]   i'm just a little bit sick yeah there's 15 de moyne's per degree

[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:18.140]   the end you're completely depleted like you want to merit this makes no sense yeah it really is

[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:11.740]   mobile uh did anything else happen this week let me check i always always forget there was the new
[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:17.740]   headphones uh there was the lawsuit against facebook uh um
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:25.500]   stadia we talked about did you any of you ever get the halo band did you get that rich
[02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:34.940]   the amazon i did not no mmm i have one no um there's a couple of things naked in front of it yeah
[02:17:34.940 --> 02:17:40.620]   there's a couple of things so first of all it's it's not a watch there's no face it's just a velcro band
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:46.860]   with a thing a bump is measuring the normal heart rate steps and stuff but if you press a button
[02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:51.420]   it also listens to everything you say and then gives you a report card at the end of the day
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:57.740]   says you were a little nasty when you talk to uh Ashley you should probably apologize to her
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:03.340]   that kind of thing uh and then you're supposed to post naked in front you can wear underpants right
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:09.420]   yes okay just like in cyberpunk just like in cyberpunk but they might you might be able to
[02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:16.220]   see you're junk but still so uh we're we're baggy shorts yeah you pose in front of it same
[02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:21.820]   senator amy clobuchar wrote a letter to the health and human services secretary Alex Azar
[02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:26.860]   saying what is your agency doing to make sure that all this information that's going to amazon
[02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:33.180]   is protected she says it's even more intrusive than many of these other products i'd already
[02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:39.100]   been concerned she said this one takes it to the nth degree now amazon says your voice recordings
[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:43.660]   don't ever leave the watch actually they i'm sorry they don't ever go to amazon they leave the
[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:47.740]   watch they go to your phone they're analyzer your phone by the app and set back to the watch but
[02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:53.900]   your pictures go to the amazon cloud because they're analyzed and then destroyed but then you have
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:58.860]   to keep taking pictures because they're looking at your body fat and i don't know i didn't even
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:05.740]   really want it i decided i didn't really even want to i don't want to look by a tape measure yeah
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:13.020]   just like you know i don't know man that just seems that seems like that just seems like excess
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:19.740]   for no reason although i would love to know how many times i say the f-word in a day it doesn't
[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:25.900]   say stuff like that it just says you know between 10 and 10 20 am you were you were sounded intrigued
[02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:35.020]   i should you were listening to david pogues new book yeah yeah you sounded depressed
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:40.140]   you sounded depressed then you saw that paper at the end you looked happy i heard you crying
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:45.740]   and then you read the hope chapter yeah you felt and i could tell you were hopeful oh it seems to
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:50.700]   somehow it's forgotten all the information but yeah it would say of course i'm doing podcast a
[02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:56.940]   lot of times so it would last i just had it interested or bored or but i rarely sound
[02:19:56.940 --> 02:20:04.060]   angry but if you now we have a listener uh doctor mom who says uh she wears it while she's out
[02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:10.380]   walking and because she's wearing a mask she's always yelling at people and it's just like you are
[02:20:10.380 --> 02:20:16.380]   you are you need anger management person we are reporting you yeah yeah and the wall street
[02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:21.340]   journals review jeffrey fowler and heather i forgot in her last name they reviewed it together and
[02:20:21.340 --> 02:20:28.140]   she suggested that it's adjectives for how she talks as a woman oh or dismissive
[02:20:28.140 --> 02:20:35.820]   oh oh of a woman heather kelly oh yeah so would say you sound overbearing is this thing gonna tell
[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:40.780]   me i sound shrill because of it's getting launched into the sun yes that's right overbearing it called
[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:48.060]   her yeah oh it described jeffrey's tone with words like opinionated while it was more likely to flag
[02:20:48.060 --> 02:20:54.540]   the tone of heather a mom of two as dismissive and even condescending i'm gonna fight
[02:20:54.540 --> 02:21:02.540]   aware of all like i'm this it makes me want to punch it into the sky actually you sound combative
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:11.580]   right now and dismissive and bossy yeah we we have spouses that can tell us we sound combat
[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:17.580]   well that's actually why i wanted it my my husband would never say that to me yeah he knows better
[02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:21.580]   but that's why i wanted it because lisa says sometimes you sound a little mean to me
[02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:26.380]   and so i said well let's see what the halo says okay yeah let's let's go to the halo
[02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:33.340]   go to the halo it is yeah go to the halo i have an app right here that says i am not being dismissive
[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:43.980]   i'm being opinionated all last week i was so nice to you yeah did not work um this is this is a
[02:21:43.980 --> 02:21:50.780]   perfect example of what tim tim net uh gebru was talking about at google where the the training
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:57.820]   set that you use on these ai very much influences what the ai says it's it's it's imperfect and if
[02:21:57.820 --> 02:22:02.940]   you train it on male voices and then you have a female voice and it's not going to do as good a
[02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:11.500]   job she did her initial work not before she came to google um on uh how face recognition technologies
[02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:20.380]   did a very poor job with women and people of color uh very famous uh google hired her to be an
[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:31.420]   ethicist in their ar she actually ran the ai ethics research at google until she wrote a paper
[02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:38.540]   that maybe was a little critical of the way google was doing things they withheld the paper
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:47.500]   she wrote an email saying uh i'm gonna quit unless you tell me uh who said this was a bad paper
[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:54.620]   you hired me to tell the truth not to whitewash what's going on rather than respond to her email
[02:22:54.620 --> 02:23:02.620]   google fired her immediately uh now of course uh google's ceo sundar patchi actually alphabet
[02:23:02.620 --> 02:23:08.860]   ceo sundar patchi apologize and said where i'm gonna look into this the paper was called on the dangers
[02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:17.420]   of stochastic parrots can language models be too big and it it lays out the risks of large language
[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:25.500]   models ai's trained on according to the mit um technology review which actually saw the paper
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:31.020]   they didn't publish the paper but they summarized it uh ai models trained on staggering amounts of
[02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:39.820]   text data have gone increasingly popular increasingly large the paper talks about uh the energy consumption
[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:45.740]   and which google said well that's old data we don't do that anymore we're haven't you heard
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:50.300]   we're carbon neutral uh don't listen to that david pog climate change isn't real
[02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:58.860]   uh the costs uh and of course the problem inscrutable models an ai model taught to view racist
[02:23:58.860 --> 02:24:03.660]   languages normals obviously bad the researchers though point out a couple of more subtle problems
[02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:09.340]   one is that shifts in language play an important role in social change the me too in black lives
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:15.180]   ladder matter movements for example try to establish a new anti-sexist anti-racist vocabulary
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:21.660]   an ai model trained on vast swaths of the internet won't be attuned to the nuances of this vocabulary
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:26.460]   and won't produce or interpret language in line with these new cultural norms there's all sort you
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:32.220]   can see there's all sorts of issues we as humans are very subtle yeah uh and our understanding of
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:40.460]   gestures handwriting speech computers are not subtle no but when you have humans programming
[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:46.780]   that training set it it helps but also when you have those their biases could be they talk about
[02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:52.700]   right their biases come into play and also their blind spots come into play and i think that that's
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:25:01.820]   actually even a bigger issue is it's not so much people programming ai to purposefully end up you
[02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:05.900]   know we've seen these examples of you know like oh michael softlike put up this ai and within like
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:10.780]   two hours it was racist or you know like neural networks they have to stuff like that but you know
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:16.220]   i think it's actually blind spots really are the problem and when you have such a large when they
[02:25:16.220 --> 02:25:23.580]   talk about in this particular study or in this paper the summary mentions these sort of really large
[02:25:23.580 --> 02:25:31.020]   repositories of information of text information you know you're just going to by default you're
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:37.340]   going to run into more issues and it's not going to be as nuanced because it's not a small batch you
[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:43.820]   know kind of specifically crafted ai and so it's it's it's tough it's a tough thing but blind spots
[02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:51.180]   i think are the the hardest thing about ai is that you know there is nobody on earth who could program
[02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:57.980]   under with an understanding of everybody else on earth and the other thing that's frustrating
[02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:06.300]   is this is why google hired kebru to do this yeah and and you characterize uh sundar's response
[02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:14.380]   as an apology um it's my understanding that there really wasn't an apology he said we could have done
[02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:20.940]   better at de-escalation yeah and she's a little upset she's like oh great so now i'm the angry
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:25.420]   black woman oh boy you're making right making it look like the emotion of it and not the the
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:29.820]   logical point she treated this they paint me as this angry black woman because they put you in this
[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:35.500]   terrible workplace and if you speak up about it then you become a problem and then they start talking
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:40.620]   about de-escalation strategies you write emails they get ignored you write documents they get
[02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:45.340]   ignored then you discuss how it's being done and they talk to you talk about you as if you're like
[02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:52.700]   some angry black woman who needs to be contained uh this is regardless of what really happened and
[02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:58.300]   i think often and i've said this before disclaimer with employment uh cases you don't always know
[02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:02.220]   all the information there's all sorts of legal restrictions and what companies can say about
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:09.660]   this uh so there may be other stuff that happen we don't know about it's not a good look for google
[02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:17.020]   at all at the least it's clumsy yeah it's clumsy and at the worst it's it's insidious yeah
[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:23.420]   um you're right it wasn't an apology was it uh it's been characterized by summons an apology but i
[02:27:23.420 --> 02:27:29.100]   don't see the word i'm sorry the circumstances he he writes that led up to dr gibber who's
[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:34.860]   departure examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process the company
[02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:39.580]   needs to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent black female leader with immense talent
[02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:47.660]   left google unhappily you know those are issues those are issues i mean she's and she's honestly a
[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:54.700]   a catch like that's right she's very valuable like she's really brilliant yeah so what a loss
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:28:01.500]   for them i mean what a what an absolute what a just i mean more than 1400 google staff members
[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:05.900]   uh nineteen hundred hundred other uh people in the field have signed a petition
[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:11.580]   supporting hashtag i support timnet and hashtag believe black women
[02:28:11.580 --> 02:28:19.340]   um actually uh that's an ongoing thing so those numbers are might even be out of day it's now
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:29.580]   2351 googlers and 3729 academic industry and civil society supporters and what is google's total
[02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:35.100]   black employee population i believe it's hundred two percent yeah that was another problem she brought
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:40.940]   up yeah yeah uh i boy things are getting worse and worse for google i have to say
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:46.220]   uh i i used to love this company and now i'm really wondering uh what's happening there
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:51.180]   but you were right uh actually when you said it's not a team sport you know you may love a company
[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:56.540]   but the company doesn't love you yeah and also companies change you know you have every right to
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.540]   to feel like you know you used to love a company and now you don't love them as much and there are
[02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:05.660]   people who feel that way about apple and samsung and i you know it's just and that's fine and you
[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:11.340]   should you should be open to criticizing companies that you care about especially the most like i
[02:29:11.340 --> 02:29:16.700]   argue i mean that you know you should be you should be critically thinking about the things that
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:23.660]   you use every day you know i i love my iphone but i i don't just blindly go with whatever apple
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:27.820]   says i mean jeez if you see any of my live tweets for their events like i kind of drag them a lot
[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:34.540]   of the time because they're just they're so easy to drag easy it's so easy um but but also you know
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:39.340]   it's just you should be doing that you should be looking at the companies that you love to use
[02:29:39.340 --> 02:29:44.220]   their products you should be looking at them with a critical eye and you should demand that they
[02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:49.580]   make their product better for you for everybody who uses it like you deserve that as a consumer
[02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:56.220]   you've given them your money you demand better from them well and as tech journalists we have an
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:30:04.220]   even higher obligation sure because uh the last i hate it when i when you go to an event an apple
[02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:10.700]   event particularly and you see the journalists applauding it's like dudes uh get off yeah that's
[02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:15.260]   that's an interesting one because you know as a journalist yeah i mean you're not really
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:20.380]   supposed to be doing that but i i agree i mean i i think that um opinions have evolved of these
[02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:25.740]   like i i have loved google for many years and in the last couple years they haven't really given me a
[02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:31.180]   lot to love um whereas apple i historically was a little bit more critical of because you know the
[02:30:31.180 --> 02:30:35.660]   way they do things and and i feel like they've given me more to love with their some of the stances
[02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:41.420]   they've taken with inclusivity and um you know just the way they run their company and so
[02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:45.100]   and then samsung somewhere in the middle like i just don't really understand them at all
[02:30:45.100 --> 02:30:50.540]   because get ready because uh seems like we just had new samsung funds now here comes the uh
[02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:57.020]   s 21 yeah but didn't they kill the note all right they killed the note all right p now i i'm so
[02:30:57.020 --> 02:31:01.820]   i'm stuck with this uh fold it's gonna be the fold right that's the thing they're gonna go for
[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:08.460]   anyway i want this i was gonna return it but i guess you only have two weeks to turn return
[02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:13.660]   what do you like about it i love the size and actually this part works where you open it up and
[02:31:13.660 --> 02:31:18.460]   there's there's you know it's it's got a big screen let me unlock it it's got a big screen i love the
[02:31:18.460 --> 02:31:24.780]   size i could play stadia on it but there are pitfalls to to folding screens one of which
[02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:30.460]   is i guess it's so delicate that you have to have a screen protector on it this one is apparently
[02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:36.860]   made of rubber so i don't know if you've ever uh used a rubber touch screen before it's not a good
[02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:44.940]   thing oh no um your finger doesn't glide it doesn't glide it's it it's it hitches rags hitches on it
[02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:51.500]   and it's also it holds dirt so i don't i can't now apparently people are it's there this screen
[02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:56.060]   protector is bubbling up now you remember in the first batch of the first four people took it off
[02:31:56.060 --> 02:32:02.700]   and it broke uh so no i've been reluctant to touch it but people have it bubbling up and stuff you
[02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:10.140]   can bring it to a samsung depot and they'll put a new one on so it's a great quality for a touch
[02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:16.460]   screen phone i'm afraid to touch it yeah what a selling point it's it's got a big it's got a it's
[02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:21.260]   nice it's like happy fun ball it's like that s&l of course happy if i do not taunt happy fun but
[02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:27.100]   just don't don't stop that at touch the touch screen not that happy don't make icon happen
[02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:33.340]   fold the the fault what's the other one flip yeah that one i you know i'm tempted because
[02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:37.420]   it's kind of a you know this one that you have i you know samsung they you know they give you
[02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:41.580]   these things for like exactly two weeks and they literally come to your house and like take it out
[02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:46.380]   of your hands if you don't know this screen the screen was great for the first two weeks yeah that's
[02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:51.020]   that's all the time they gave you it never get to see what happens if it's great yeah and i wanted
[02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:56.060]   to return this after two weeks but unfortunately took us too long to review it so i i bought it for
[02:32:56.060 --> 02:33:02.860]   two thousand dollars i didn't really oh my god yeah well that's you know my that's just shy of four
[02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:10.380]   air pods pro max i know you know you can totally flip that on ebay today for like maybe 700 this is
[02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:17.500]   really cheesy i got they send you for 50 bucks so i got a 50 bucks like coupon so i i said all by the
[02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:21.900]   leather case because you know you carry this around and you feel like if i drop this it is
[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:26.380]   definitely going to break and that's two thousand so this is the leather case they send you
[02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:34.540]   god for 50 dollars that's it it goes snaps on the back and by the way it's not that leathery it's
[02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:40.220]   more like a pink rubber it's it's like plastic more rubber more rubber maybe i'm tactically challenged
[02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:45.020]   maybe i shouldn't be using samsung devices have you ever burned your hands and killed your
[02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:49.740]   ribs and your hands leo oh yeah i used to work in mcdonald's as a fry cook i got no feeling in my
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:55.420]   face at all that's that's the problem those phones are not meant for former fry cooks no no that's
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:59.740]   on the that's actually on the box it's on the disclaimer on the box it says if you were ever
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:04.940]   fry cooks please do not buy it's like a firefighter saying okay i'm going out i'm going to put on the
[02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:14.460]   one glove if you were so i'm a teenager i'm a kid i don't know but if you work at mcdonald's as one
[02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:20.700]   of the cooks you're ex and i'm sure they have a machine that does this now but you're expected
[02:34:20.700 --> 02:34:24.700]   they have a special long spatula because you're cooking like 800 hamburgers at once
[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:30.220]   it's a special long spatula and you're supposed to i was taught to anyway you put the spatula under
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:35.260]   the burgers you hold them with your fingers their things are searing hot and flip them
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:42.380]   and it's considered you just have to it's macho you can't say it hurts oh no you have to do that
[02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:47.980]   so i i can almost guarantee that's not the way they're pretty sure they don't do that anymore
[02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:53.580]   i'm pretty sure that was my number one the fingers on the burger are concerning more than
[02:34:53.580 --> 02:35:00.220]   your searing your seared fingertips yeah now that i think about it that was kind that's kind of odd
[02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:04.700]   but that's how you did it and there now you have no fingerprints anymore because the oil just
[02:35:04.700 --> 02:35:09.180]   burned them right off i'm sure it's helpful though because now you know when i'm making pizza in a
[02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:13.900]   pizza oven or whatever i could just pick it to you right now so leah when so you worked making
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:20.460]   these hamburgers what what ages were you 16 to about 18 or 19 something like that well that's
[02:35:20.460 --> 02:35:27.260]   incredible because you know what i did from 16 to 17 what i wanted a chick-full a oh yum so there
[02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:36.780]   must be some commonality food and tech food workers become tech homeless actually i loved working at
[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:43.100]   mcdonald's i really enjoyed it it was my first job i learned how to work that you know they say
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:46.620]   every you never standing still you're always cleaning you're always doing something it was a
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:50.540]   very it was a great lesson i got i remember 325 an hour
[02:35:50.540 --> 02:35:59.980]   and that was more money back in the 1920s but still you know it was before the depression
[02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:04.140]   for the depression that was good i was happy to have it i was happy to have it
[02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:09.820]   um all right all right let's take it one more break but i do want to talk about hbomax
[02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:16.220]   streaming movies disney did you watch the four hour disney plus reveal talk about
[02:36:16.220 --> 02:36:20.540]   talking for a long time you know i did leo come on of course you did all right we're gonna talk
[02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:25.580]   well we'll wind up with all of that and i just like to say the word john stanky over and over
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:31.100]   again so uh we'll get we'll get to all of that in just a little bit what i i love this panel can
[02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:37.100]   you just stay here all week and and i'll come back and we'll do it again how about that
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:42.060]   our show we're here in the beautiful last past studio i really want to thank last past all year
[02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:48.700]   uh long last past has been our studio naming sponsor um i've been using them for 12 years
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:54.380]   they're their absolute best last password manager out there we use we started using last past
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:37:01.820]   corporately about five years ago there was kind of a funny story around this one of our engineers
[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:08.540]   could never remember the passwords to things like our web pages and you know data bases and
[02:37:08.540 --> 02:37:13.500]   amazon and all that stuff so he made a nice little public website with all the passwords in it so
[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:19.740]   he wouldn't forget um turned out that was probably not a good idea when we saw that we said oh we're
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:25.580]   getting last pass right now if and i imagine for a lot of companies you're sending employees home
[02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:30.220]   there's a little trepidation they have the keys to the kingdom you know your bank accounts your
[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:35.980]   databases everything they've got those passwords if you're using last pass you don't have to worry
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:41.260]   first of all they don't got those passwords last pass does the data is never decrypted anywhere
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:50.540]   but on device computer laptop phone in they have every applique every browser every uh every uh
[02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:55.820]   operating system and so your and your employees may not even have to know the password they just
[02:37:55.820 --> 02:38:00.940]   see the dots and it's all done they're logged in in many cases they they use single sign on 1200
[02:38:00.940 --> 02:38:06.620]   applications which is even better it's passwordless they love it life is simple for them but you will
[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:10.780]   love it too and your IT department security people will love it too because they know exactly
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:16.780]   who's using what when and where and and because last pass does things like multi-factor authentication
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:22.940]   contextual information like ip address geolocation you can really be sure that only the right people
[02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:28.300]   are accessing your data it's called a zero knowledge security model this was invented at google the
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:32.780]   idea that you know in the old days you figure anybody inside the perimeter well you know they're
[02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:38.300]   inside the perimeter so they're safe no no we know that's not you can't do that you assume
[02:38:38.940 --> 02:38:44.940]   everybody is a threat and you have to make sure that everybody is authenticated properly that's
[02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:52.860]   what last pass does you can have absolute control over there's a hundred plus policies you can enforce
[02:38:52.860 --> 02:38:57.820]   we for instance require employees to use two-factor authentication we have minimum standards for
[02:38:57.820 --> 02:39:03.820]   for their master password you can view password scores for every employee you can see what accounts
[02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:08.940]   they're sharing what groups their members of when they share passwords they can do it with last pass
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:16.700]   securely not on a post-it note or via text message it makes it easy to integrate onboarding users and
[02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:21.420]   uh revoking access syncing groups because it'll work with what no matter what your organization
[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:27.100]   source of truth it'll work with whatever directory system you're using i can just go on and on it's
[02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:32.380]   so easy to use it's so powerful and it's so secure and it does the thing that is so hard to do which
[02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:37.500]   is it makes it good security more convenient and normally that's a trade-off it's more secure
[02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:43.500]   as less convenient but last pass makes it actually easier employees love it you will love it and of
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:49.020]   course it uses best strong encryption algorithms and your master passwords never transmitted
[02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:53.900]   anywhere but on the device things like that i t-leaders need to invest now in upgrading or
[02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:58.460]   adding security technologies because remote work isn't over it's not going to be over for a while
[02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:03.420]   let your employees be more productive and more secure start with last passes we what we did and
[02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:09.740]   i am so glad this is this is no time don't wait till the end of the year when you get your new
[02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:14.460]   budget to get strong security now is the time to start solidifying your cybersecurity strategy
[02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:19.580]   with the award-winning last pass a best password manager out there go to last pass dot com slash

[02:40:49.900 --> 02:40:56.380]   ashio i i read a summary of all that's i didn't even do that i read a paragraph
[02:40:56.380 --> 02:41:03.740]   uh it it was a lot one line one line price increase for disney plus yes they're going to 799
[02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:12.300]   and then simultaneously the game awards at a certain point the tga yeah it was a lot animal crossing
[02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:19.100]   best family game of 2020 they're not wrong they're not wrong what was the best game
[02:41:20.060 --> 02:41:26.060]   do you remember best game of this year i mean i argue it was animal crossing but i'd agree
[02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:31.100]   um but i also understand i mean all of the nominees are really good
[02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:37.180]   uh the last of us part two is not not a game that is for me it's depressing especially not now
[02:41:37.180 --> 02:41:41.660]   it's a good game yeah but it's depressing that was the best game of the year yeah
[02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:46.940]   and then ghost of sushema also very very good um i just
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:52.540]   animal crossing was the game i needed this year so yeah game of the year it's so funny and i think
[02:41:52.540 --> 02:41:59.260]   people mock us for playing it and stuff i know my wife does but uh there's a lot of thought and
[02:41:59.260 --> 02:42:04.940]   beauty in it and there's no in-game purchases so it's not i spent hundreds of dollars on simpson's
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:11.340]   tapped out donuts much more than i spent i love that you're at simpson's tapped out donuts whale
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:15.980]   come on i am a whale what are you doing and well this is something that's still a little bitter
[02:42:15.980 --> 02:42:21.980]   about this is some years ago but somehow it crashed and lost my town and i still had 300 donuts
[02:42:21.980 --> 02:42:30.300]   and hundreds of dollars sunk into it i do fear that with uh animal crossing but at least i
[02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:36.380]   haven't spent money to do all this i love it they did not there is no one up oh time what is time
[02:42:36.380 --> 02:42:40.140]   i'm stuck at home anyway yeah what is time at this point it's just a construct they even there's
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:43.420]   little thoughtful things like they've set it up so that you really there's no point in spending more
[02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:49.340]   than an hour a day on it right Ashley yeah i mean got 20 minutes yeah like we really
[02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:55.820]   just you know after you chop you do some some like gardening yeah you want to spend the big chunks
[02:42:55.820 --> 02:43:00.540]   of time you can yeah but you're doing you're kind of then it's a repetitive you're a little grinding
[02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:05.660]   must see i think this is an interesting point that you're making is that so they engineered this game
[02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:10.300]   because there is no in-app purchase there's no sort of like push to right kids you know i've i've two
[02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:15.420]   young kids that are like you know um with roblox and this is why i'm kind of like on a rant against
[02:43:15.420 --> 02:43:19.980]   it is because it's this whole thing of like getting them to play as long as humanly possible right
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:24.380]   because all they want is in-app purchases and clothes and this not in like the roblox you know the
[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:29.340]   roblox i think they're called oh my gosh fight a nickel for every time they ask me for a roblox
[02:43:29.340 --> 02:43:34.940]   i'd be or roblox i'd be a rich nut Nintendo deserves a lot of praise for not doing yes
[02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:40.460]   and absolutely i would look at for the kids because you're built you you have a house
[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:45.980]   you're decorating it you're making things for it then eventually you're decorating your island
[02:43:45.980 --> 02:43:51.100]   you're trying to make it look nice you get awards for the better the better your house looks in the
[02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:55.820]   better you can't fish you open a museum yeah you have a museum they're real animals that exist you
[02:43:55.820 --> 02:44:00.300]   like go look in there and they'll tell you real there's educational stuff yeah blathers the museum
[02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:08.060]   curator insists on telling you he insists so he's so disappointed when you say no no i'm busy thanks
[02:44:08.060 --> 02:44:17.660]   anyway he goes oh okay it's really a guy the little details i know we sound nuts but i'm sincere
[02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:21.580]   here the little details in this i think are really impressive in the fact that they're not
[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:27.580]   scamming you i should say full full disclosure for anybody listening i i have done e-sports casting
[02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:33.580]   with nintendo for splatoon and the producer of that game is also one of the producers of animal

[02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:46.380]   impressed with what he did with animal crossing yeah and he just it's like he they're just um mr no
[02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:50.700]   gami in particular just like just a really delightful kind of like weirdo and like i just
[02:44:50.700 --> 02:44:56.300]   appreciate his his team it's kind of a japanese game though it's kind of very japanese feel to it i
[02:44:56.300 --> 02:45:02.060]   can't wait till sequara season what do you love how this started out as a what you did with disney i
[02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:09.820]   know i don't know i'm sorry twice now all roads lead to a cnh i'm so sorry okay disney's lead back to
[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:15.420]   pulling turn-ups out of animal turn-ups so the deal with turn-ups they call it the stalk market
[02:45:15.420 --> 02:45:20.140]   because you got stalks of turn-ups no i'm sorry let's go on to disney you're doing it again
[02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:26.540]   that's actually leo and i are just gonna launch an animal crossing i think we should is there must
[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:34.220]   be an animal crossing this week in animal crossing t don't have an idea i a c twiac but the really
[02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:41.260]   stunning thing about the disney plus announcement please please get us back on track they are launching
[02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:50.300]   a new serial television spin-off of star wars not one not two not five
[02:45:50.300 --> 02:45:59.420]   ten and ten on ten marvel as well and ten marvel like how can how will they maintain any quality
[02:45:59.420 --> 02:46:03.180]   with that much stuff well you would one would argue the mandalorian's good right
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:11.260]   yeah but that's one not twenty well so i i argue that they're so some of these are limited
[02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:18.700]   so like for example they might only be like one season um so loki is a good example of something
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:26.140]   that is probably not going to be very successful is it a movie trilogy a you know six hours of film
[02:46:26.140 --> 02:46:31.900]   but a six-hour miniseries on disney plus with a smaller budget great for them great
[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:38.860]   it on the other hand it's only eight bucks a month so that's pretty good so this is the
[02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:44.780]   problem with apple tv faces which is they don't have enough depths so disney not only started with
[02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:49.980]   a great catalog but now they're creating massive amounts of content i think that's a very smart
[02:46:49.980 --> 02:46:56.620]   meanwhile over at hpo which is now which is owned by time which is on by warner brothers which owned
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:47:04.780]   by warner media which is owned by atnt uh they've just announced warner's just announced you know
[02:47:04.780 --> 02:47:11.100]   the movie theaters overrated covid all of the movies next year are going to go on at the same
[02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:16.700]   time as they're released for theaters are going to go on hpo max free free which is going to cost
[02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:21.500]   them a pretty penny um this was that thing we were talking about earlier which is we're moving away
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:27.900]   from owning content physical content even movie theaters to everything is over the internet
[02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:34.140]   all streamed all the time and partly that's been hastened by covid but i think it's also the next
[02:47:34.140 --> 02:47:40.220]   big thing i think there's i think there's a never any doubt yeah people get mad at me when i say
[02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:44.940]   that they say no i love books i love my dvd's they're the best qualities on uh d blue ray
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:51.420]   and i go well yeah that is true that's true i'm not so i'm not denying that leo just a tip
[02:47:51.420 --> 02:48:04.700]   from a pro best not to mock your views you know i'm not talking about them okay so many people
[02:48:04.700 --> 02:48:10.220]   have wanted this idea of you know the at home like people are like oh i'll gladly pay 50 bucks to
[02:48:10.220 --> 02:48:14.220]   watch this movie at home which by the way has turned out not to be true because when they wanted
[02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:19.260]   to charge 20 dollars for the moulin i was like no i was just waiting three months with the mural house
[02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:24.060]   yeah did your kids pressure you but there's the thing they're doing but they're doing it again
[02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:29.580]   which means it had to have been successful no they're not they're not charging for HBO mess
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:35.500]   no that's Disney Disney Disney's doing that yeah Disney's doing that yeah Disney never said if moulin
[02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:39.820]   succeeded or not they gave the impression that maybe they did do all right because and now that
[02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:43.260]   we know they're gonna do it again i think they're doing rya the last dragon is the one that's going
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:51.020]   to be how about ten who owns tenet oh that's a war war that where you um you pay a hundred
[02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:58.460]   bucks and you get the entire movie theater right for yeah like 16 people so my my family plus two
[02:48:58.460 --> 02:49:05.580]   guests went and you did that yeah we did it it was cheaper than buying movie tickets and it was so
[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:12.060]   cool i mean it was so cool so you had 10 people how many people did you have we had uh we had nine
[02:49:12.060 --> 02:49:16.780]   people and so you had the whole theater yourself whole theater to ourselves and we could pop
[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:22.780]   we could talk we could use our phones we could you feel safe yeah totally safe they they come in with
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:29.500]   a crew right before you go in and they disinfect everything and yeah i mean this was probably three
[02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:34.860]   months ago is there popcorn is there a concession okay there's popcorn you buy all the same stuff
[02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:41.260]   and and then we watched tenet really cool and had no clue what was happening that movie
[02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:45.500]   that movie is bad storytelling you just have no idea what's happening well that's kind of
[02:49:45.500 --> 02:49:52.460]   just a no one right you bought this gameplay hoping to understand it oh no it still makes no sense
[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:57.820]   oh dear who are these people who are they working for what's going on i often think that with
[02:49:57.820 --> 02:50:02.700]   inception i kind of took me a while to figure out yeah i kind of think that's his thing
[02:50:02.700 --> 02:50:09.180]   um have you seen have you seen the max thing is like you so there's like a few things at play
[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:15.420]   here one there is no longer the paramount rule so these movie studios like disney and Warner
[02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:20.860]   Brothers they do not care if AMC goes out of business because then no they want them to go out of
[02:50:20.860 --> 02:50:26.460]   business by AMC and then they will own a theater they want them to go out of business so that's
[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:31.820]   that's one part of it but the other part of it for um for HBO Max i think actually this is a
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:38.060]   little bit short-sighted um and there has been a lot of outrage in the in the industry about this
[02:50:38.060 --> 02:50:43.900]   from filmmakers and actors um and Chris Christopher Chris Veron did an interview and
[02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:50.300]   discussed this um and he doesn't mention like him uh specifically he talks about the unions and
[02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:56.460]   residuals well there's a big problem because they owe these people box office percentages and
[02:50:56.460 --> 02:51:01.900]   and other aren't the bigger talent the top of the line talent is going to get back end so they're
[02:51:01.900 --> 02:51:06.860]   getting you know like they had to buy out patty jankins what's the back end on HBO Max
[02:51:06.860 --> 02:51:13.100]   so what you're buying them out on the bed there is none so it's the thing is that's the problem
[02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:15.820]   is it a presumed back end they say well we would have made
[02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:23.020]   90 million dollars so here's nine million so as i understand it with Wonder Woman 1984 patty jankins
[02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:30.860]   and that entire cast got ahead of what they they knew it was coming 2021 yeah and there was a
[02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:37.820]   separate discussion made okay to allow Wonder Woman to to launch she's the director and gagadot is the
[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:44.540]   star and they both got big payments yeah they have been paid they have been paid so a lot of times
[02:51:44.540 --> 02:51:50.380]   if you're not familiar with how movies work and how payments work so a lot of times like an actor
[02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:55.340]   will take 10 million dollars and then if the movie makes a billion dollars at the box office they get
[02:51:55.340 --> 02:52:01.340]   an extra 10 million dollars and so that's their bonus they get a box office bonus and so Warner
[02:52:01.340 --> 02:52:08.300]   bought out those bonuses to allow Wonder Woman to stream day and date on Christmas day none of the
[02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:15.900]   talent next year in 2021 none of those as as i understand it and i i didn't run but i'm pretty
[02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:22.300]   sure i had read it 2021 wow HBO Max just announced hey we're releasing these day and date like and
[02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:27.260]   and all of the filmmakers are very upset not only for obviously themselves because that's a lot of
[02:52:27.260 --> 02:52:33.820]   money but they're also upset for the unions because when these things go to streaming and
[02:52:33.820 --> 02:52:38.620]   they're signed for and everything these there are there are union agreements for yachty and a lot
[02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:44.780]   of these other they're crew these are these are regular people who you know barely make ends meet
[02:52:44.780 --> 02:52:50.300]   a lot of times in hollywood or who you know just work jobs and and they are i don't know if they
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:55.820]   make money on the i don't know if they make a percentage of the the take of the you know if you're
[02:52:55.820 --> 02:53:01.660]   you're a driver for like the union they get residuals they do get residual payment when those
[02:53:01.660 --> 02:53:06.860]   contracts are signed and that and that streaming property is sold there is a residual payment made
[02:53:06.860 --> 02:53:12.700]   okay well i mean look at the end of the day i i give hbo max credit i would have never thought
[02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:16.780]   that they would do something like this now maybe it's a push at and t like you said leo is you know
[02:53:16.780 --> 02:53:22.060]   the parent company at this point so clearly um you know they are i mean you would think they're
[02:53:22.060 --> 02:53:29.500]   forward thinking but they're the death star may t and t wants this because it gets people onto
[02:53:29.500 --> 02:53:35.580]   hbo hbo max which is that that's all they make money down the road because of subscriptions
[02:53:35.580 --> 02:53:42.780]   yeah on their networks that's what i was saying we have all yeah i was surprised to see that hbo
[02:53:42.780 --> 02:53:49.660]   max's launch was considered a flop they have 12 million subscribers disney plus now has what
[02:53:49.660 --> 02:53:58.540]   80 million wow only only 30 percent of people who had hbo who get hbo max for free
[02:53:58.540 --> 02:54:04.220]   signed up for it see that's bizarre that's because they can't figure it out i think you nailed it
[02:54:04.220 --> 02:54:07.820]   it's not that they don't want it they just don't know they've got it they don't even know they can
[02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:13.180]   even have them they still have three apps you've got a you had very confusing holdouts in roku
[02:54:13.180 --> 02:54:18.540]   which is still a holdout yeah you had uh h uh what was the other one fire tv just came on board
[02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:22.060]   like two or three weeks ago that's right so i mean when you look at the two largest streaming
[02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:28.620]   platforms here in the u_s_ i mean you know fire tv roku to the biggest were not even available and
[02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:31.660]   then you had these different apps there's three different apps that people were downloading which
[02:54:31.660 --> 02:54:38.940]   was hbo now hbo go and hbo max i mean i was totally a mess it was insane ridiculous absolutely ridiculous
[02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:45.500]   and i do think it's a mistake because they're losing they're already losing directors who
[02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:50.140]   who are just not going to want to work with christopher nolan it's a game to play i mean the
[02:54:50.140 --> 02:54:54.220]   thing is is it's a dangerous game for them talent in hollywood went to bed thinking they were working
[02:54:54.220 --> 02:55:00.220]   for the best movie company in hollywood warner brothers and woke up realizing they were working
[02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:04.380]   for the worst streaming company i don't buy that i don't buy that give me a break
[02:55:04.380 --> 02:55:09.980]   nanny jane's is already leaving considered the most evil force in hollywood and so many hollywood
[02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:13.980]   people have gone there and taken a big payday well this is why atnt he's doing this i mean you
[02:55:13.980 --> 02:55:17.740]   could there's two possible reasons it could be an antitrust thing trying to put the theaters out of
[02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:21.820]   business i wouldn't put it past them but the other reason they're doing it they're recognizing the
[02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:26.460]   facts of the matter which is people at least through june aren't going to be going back to the theaters
[02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:33.660]   right and that their big competition is not it's netflix that that's where people are going to be
[02:55:33.660 --> 02:55:40.460]   getting their content from going forward is netflix amazon prime and so they've got to they've got
[02:55:40.460 --> 02:55:45.660]   to do something to compete and disney i mean disney is one of the biggest forces out there i mean
[02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:51.260]   who when they opened up with this back catalog of stuff they did a great job but like they are
[02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:55.900]   continuing i mean i see we have a billboard here on the 405 where i drive past and it's like
[02:55:55.900 --> 02:55:59.820]   they haven't something new every single month it's just like you know netflix has a million
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:04.780]   new things every month but like disney plus is really doing a good job of like keeping the service
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:09.420]   fresh not in it you know with these huge things but like enough to keep you going there was some
[02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:13.260]   enough to keep you paying there was some thought that part of it might be that Warner looked at
[02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:20.940]   Warner's looked at its 20-20-1 slate of movies and thought like the conjuring the
[02:56:20.940 --> 02:56:27.740]   the devil made me do it but they have the four gotzilla versus kong
[02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:33.980]   tom and uh really that's a big movie yeah but matrices four would be i think some of these
[02:56:33.980 --> 02:56:40.940]   look good yeah there's an interesting theory that someone had put forth that i had heard that was
[02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:47.980]   that this was actually very advantageous for for warner's to do in 2021 during the while the pandemic
[02:56:47.980 --> 02:56:52.780]   is still happening and while not while movie theaters aren't going to be back 100 percent
[02:56:52.780 --> 02:57:00.540]   is that by releasing these movies day and date for one month which they say so it'll be one month
[02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:09.100]   it's like 30 days it's not forever is that um HBO max HBO will be able to and Warner Brothers
[02:57:09.100 --> 02:57:14.060]   will be able to write off the production costs of these movies as marketing expenses
[02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:20.220]   and so so instead of taking that really big hit it's a tax fee low box office
[02:57:20.220 --> 02:57:25.420]   it ends up being okay well now we're not going to go bankrupt because now we can write these
[02:57:25.420 --> 02:57:32.540]   movies off as a marketing expense for HBO max right because it'll because technically it is a
[02:57:32.540 --> 02:57:37.340]   promotion it's they're promoting it by only allowing it to be available for the first month
[02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:43.500]   at its in theaters but that's the 800 pound elephant in the room uh Warner Brothers says that this
[02:57:43.500 --> 02:57:49.180]   is a one-year experiment but everybody else is saying bull on that you're not gonna you're not
[02:57:49.180 --> 02:57:56.140]   gonna snap back to the old way in 2022 well they have well they might have the option
[02:57:56.140 --> 02:58:00.860]   unless every movie theater goes out of business because of it no one's gonna know what the new
[02:58:00.860 --> 02:58:06.780]   way is honestly it'll be some weird hybrid yeah thing like it's not gonna be the way it was for
[02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:12.300]   sure it's not gonna be the way it was and i think i think what has been happening in the film and
[02:58:12.300 --> 02:58:15.900]   television industry has only been accelerated by the pandemic
[02:58:15.900 --> 02:58:22.620]   wow this is really i should have started with this this is a good topic this is a lot of
[02:58:22.620 --> 02:58:28.300]   you guys all gonna get the vaccine as soon as yes you can get how about you david yeah absolutely
[02:58:28.300 --> 02:58:32.620]   how about you rich i did i did a story on the vaccine two weeks ago for sidget sunday morning
[02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:38.860]   and the original plan was for me to get the vaccine on camera i was like oh wow well you know i'm sure
[02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:44.060]   there'll be a redox you'll get a chance to do that um i'm not sure i would have wanted two
[02:58:44.060 --> 02:58:49.260]   two weeks ago though that's really brave of you now that enough people have done it we can see what
[02:58:49.260 --> 02:58:54.060]   some of the issues are and so forth there is a big tech story i mean both of these uh
[02:58:54.060 --> 02:59:02.620]   technologies both of these vaccines are using mr and a messenger rna which is a really amazing
[02:59:02.620 --> 02:59:07.180]   breakthrough in vaccine design and the fact that we were able to design these in under a year
[02:59:08.220 --> 02:59:12.940]   and i guess the you did the story so you could tell me the modena and the fizer vaccines are very
[02:59:12.940 --> 02:59:18.140]   similar almost interchangeable yeah there's actually an even more incredible story they didn't come up
[02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:24.140]   with this in a year first of all a lot of it was done for the sars uh virus that was already in place
[02:59:24.140 --> 02:59:29.980]   which has a coronavirus as well right right yeah and if you go back even farther there's this
[02:59:29.980 --> 02:59:37.500]   amazing Hungarian woman this researcher at university of pennsylvania who started with this idea of
[02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:44.220]   harnessing mr and mr and a to fight diseases and it was such an a far-fetched ridiculous idea
[02:59:44.220 --> 02:59:49.900]   nobody would give her a grant and she was actually demoted oh my god that you have
[02:59:49.900 --> 02:59:57.020]   and then in 2005 she finally nailed it she published the paper the two guys who read that paper
[02:59:57.020 --> 03:00:05.660]   went on to found get this mederna and biont no kidding those are the two vaccines we have now
[03:00:05.660 --> 03:00:10.780]   well she deserves a Nobel prize in medicine i hope she gets one down the road and by the way
[03:00:10.780 --> 03:00:15.020]   david you are great on cbs this morning i forgot to mention that in your opening credits but that's

[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:34.220]   you know link to the story see that's one thing that's changed dramatically over the last couple
[03:01:34.220 --> 03:01:38.700]   of decades it used to be that companies were terrified because the cable companies would get
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:44.780]   mad if you put content online they were worried that it would be killed viewership and so they really
[03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:50.380]   the contracts usually prohibited that but now they're well i remember when you two launched
[03:01:50.380 --> 03:01:56.460]   nbc sued them saying why are you putting saturday live clips up you're killing us and of course they
[03:01:56.460 --> 03:01:59.900]   quickly learned oh my god this is the best thing that ever happened to saturday night wow
[03:01:59.900 --> 03:02:05.260]   yeah right i think that's still an issue with a lot of these um media companies you know it's like

[03:04:40.140 --> 03:04:43.740]   we love all the things you do as well anything you want to plug in particular
[03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:52.860]   um yeah actually you know i'm gonna plug a not cnet thing um i do a comic book show called
[03:04:52.860 --> 03:05:00.300]   comic book squad oh nice with my friends hector navaro and damey and pwatié um and we do that on
[03:05:00.300 --> 03:05:05.500]   twitch every other wednesday oh nice talk about comic books it's just a little it's a little book
[03:05:05.500 --> 03:05:09.420]   club that's what we do we talk about comic books so this week we're uh this wednesday it's every
[03:05:09.420 --> 03:05:14.860]   other wednesday night at eight o'clock pacific and um yeah it's comic book squad so we're gonna
[03:05:14.860 --> 03:05:20.060]   read mr miracle this week and we're really excited because one of the artists on the book mitch
[03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:25.340]   uh mitch jared's is gonna come join us gary's join us oh that's cool uh so yeah it should be
[03:05:25.340 --> 03:05:29.740]   really fun and uh and and we love it and it's a really small little community we don't it's not a
[03:05:29.740 --> 03:05:34.460]   ton of people it's free to watch uh we do it because we love comic books and it's live only
[03:05:34.460 --> 03:05:40.060]   yeah i'm i'm one of those uh people on everybody keeps asking me to archive the episodes and
[03:05:40.060 --> 03:05:45.180]   upload them to youtube and i'm like no you have to come watch it on that wednesday night and then
[03:05:45.180 --> 03:05:51.180]   twitch will keep it for two weeks and then it will go away forever that's so retro but that is such
[03:05:51.180 --> 03:05:57.020]   a cool idea though i think online twitch book club i mean that's brilliant yeah we just talk about
[03:05:57.020 --> 03:06:01.420]   it and then we got the chat everybody can chat about it we pick what we're gonna read the next
[03:06:01.420 --> 03:06:05.580]   time so everybody has a couple weeks we let everybody know what you know what we're gonna read and
[03:06:05.580 --> 03:06:12.940]   um sometimes we'll read maybe just one volume so we might read you know five to eight issues uh
[03:06:12.940 --> 03:06:17.580]   or sometimes like mr miracle it's a 12-ish you run so we just are gonna read the whole thing
[03:06:17.580 --> 03:06:25.340]   wow do you read it out loud no no we just talk about it like a book club yeah talk about the artwork
[03:06:25.340 --> 03:06:30.700]   talk about themes um sometimes we you know we obviously we talk about how it relates to real life
[03:06:30.700 --> 03:06:34.620]   we talk about the time it was written because a lot of times we'll read kind of older books we might
[03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:39.260]   read an older run of something i will say oh well this was written in this year so we can see how
[03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:44.060]   the author was a little clumsy in this way or you know things like that and what was going on at that
[03:06:44.060 --> 03:06:48.940]   time when that book was written so i love it and it looks like you guys are in a comic book too
[03:06:48.940 --> 03:06:53.420]   which i really like that later i decided that in photoshop thank you so much you noticed i
[03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:59.660]   designed a little comic book panel for us to live in and um and so it's but it's really fun and i
