[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   Great to see you.

[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   Hi Alex.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.000]   Hey Leo, great to see you.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Great to see you.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.040]   Newly moved to the big apple.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   That's right.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.840]   I went cross country, moved from San Francisco to New York and finally decided it was time
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.360]   to live on my own and ditch the roommates.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   So a big moment.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360]   Oh, that is.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.720]   It's a big moment in every boy's life.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.720]   That's right.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.400]   You know, I could live with roommates forever, I think.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   But I had a friend visit look around and be like, you can't keep doing this.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   You're over and here.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   You're over.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   You're grown up now.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.040]   You should have your own place.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.040]   That's fun.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.440]   Are you in Manhattan or in Brooklyn or?
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, I'm in Brooklyn right underneath the Barclays Center.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.360]   I mean, I'm a lifelong mixed fan, but plan to attend a bunch of netscames this year.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.600]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.320]   It's just down the street.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   That's right.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.720]   Also moving back to New York.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.160]   I say back because Dan Patterson fled New York during COVID, but he's back, which is a
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.880]   good sign for all of us technology reported CBS.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   Hi, Dan.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.360]   Hey, well, we just did part time upstate and then part time in the city.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   Nice.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.880]   You know, my wife and I pulled through this live video thing and it was in 700 square feet,
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.080]   a little challenging in New York City.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.360]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   Both you and.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   But it is great to be back.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.520]   Both you and Alex move back just in time for the flood.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.960]   Well, too, we had a hurricane two weeks ago.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.960]   Oh, that's right.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.800]   I was saturated, totally saturated.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.920]   So this one, I think this one was bad, but it wouldn't have been nearly as bad without
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920]   the prior one.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.360]   And our meteorologist keeps saying this is climate change is not coming.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   It's here.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   Right.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   Yeah, I guess you could debate that.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.840]   I don't, you know, we still have people, viewers of these shows, which surprises me saying,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   oh, it's a hoax.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   What is it going to stop being a.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.640]   You want science doesn't care about debates.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.440]   What is it going to stop being a hoax?
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.840]   Oh, maybe when the whole place burns to the ground, I don't know.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.720]   Yeah, we've got our own problems out here in the West.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.920]   That's where Larry Maggot is.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.160]   Good to see you, Larry, from connect safely.org.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.360]   It's a shame we can't hang out in Petaluma like we did last time.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   Next time.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.360]   I know.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   Hopefully.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.280]   We so there was this brief period of time when everything seemed like it was getting
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   back to normal.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.560]   Larry was sitting right next to me.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   Now we're back.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.560]   Remote.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   We're back.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   Delta.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   Oh, well, let's not.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.120]   This has not become the apocalypse show.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.840]   So we'll pretend something wonderful is going on.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.800]   Let me see if I can find that.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.320]   Oh, how about this?
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200]   Apple says, oh, never mind.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.720]   We spent many hours talking about Apple's child sexual abuse material detection.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.520]   Larry, I should actually start with you because you are very active in protecting
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.120]   children online.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.840]   Apple, as everybody knows, because we talked about it at a nauseum, was going to use the
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.040]   database from neck Mac.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.840]   You work closely with Mac Mac the National Center.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.160]   I was on board for 20 years.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.720]   Missing exploited children.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.320]   They're an organization found started and funded by the government, but non governmental.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.760]   They're a nonprofit.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.680]   But they do maintain and they're the only place legally allowed to maintain a database of
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.760]   child sexual abuse material.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.000]   They create a fingerprint hash that almost everybody uses to detect it on their own servers.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.200]   So they don't have to send the images around just the fingerprint.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.080]   Then Google, Microsoft, Facebook, everybody uses this to detect it.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.720]   Apple's proposal was a little different.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.280]   Instead of scanning right there on iCloud, as everybody else does, Apple wanted to scan
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.840]   the images on their way to iCloud.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.280]   In other words, put the scanner on your phone.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.120]   I don't know if that was what triggered people, but there was something about this
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.240]   Sankra-sanct phone that made people say no, Apple.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   I think listening.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.400]   You know those ads Apple ran that said what happens in your phone stays in your phone.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.840]   Yeah, Apple might have been.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.320]   That could have been why people thought this about the right thing.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   They created expectations.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.000]   Of course, Apple fought the good fight with the FBI around the time when the FBI wanted
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.440]   to break their encryption around the San Bernardino shooter.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.080]   I think Apple really had a bad messaging over this.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.840]   Part of the problem is the kind of stuff that Apple would have reported to neck-meck,
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.000]   the National Center for the Phoenix-Pooded Children.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.640]   I don't want to go into it on this show, but this is not pictures of Topless 17-year-olds.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   Oh, no, it's horrible.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.640]   It's really horrible.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.880]   Horrible, horrible stuff.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.640]   That's something to do with that.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.040]   I think it's important, and I'm going to let you talk in a second, but I think it's
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:33.040]   important to say right up front, nobody was opposed to this was in favor of this imagery,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.360]   child pornography, peter-esty of any kind.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.680]   Nobody was saying that, but there is also this notion that if a company wants to do
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.920]   something intrusive, they wrap it in, think of the children or terrorism, they wrap it
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.160]   in these hot-button subjects so that deflects criticism.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.560]   So, I just want to say that up front.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.960]   Nobody's proposing that this stuff should exist.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.800]   Everybody says, "Yes, it's a good idea to come up with stuff."
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.440]   In fact, I'm going to go a step further.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.480]   I don't think anybody is mad at Facebook or Microsoft or Google for doing the same thing
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.240]   on their cloud servers.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.280]   Google does it with Gmail attachments.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.920]   Nobody said boo about that.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.920]   All right.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.520]   In fact, they're obligated.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.600]   If it shows up on their server, isn't it their algorithm matching software, which by the
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.920]   way was developed by Microsoft, it's called photoDNI, if it spots it or gets a hit against
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.360]   the neck-neck database, then they are legally obligated to report it to the cyber tip line,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.720]   which is operated by the National Center.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.000]   I think that's a good model.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.960]   I think part of Apple's problem is, again, on one hand, I think they were thinking that
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.320]   by doing this on the device, they were actually making for greater privacy for their users,
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:49.320]   but it really confused the matter and created a backlash, which was probably fair.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.560]   I'm not saying it's unfair, but it was unfortunate because they were trying to do the right thing.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.760]   You say the benefits.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.280]   You actually wrote an article about this last month outweigh the risks, but has your mind
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.520]   been changed in the three weeks since by the conversation?
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:13.560]   To some extent, I think if I were to rewrite that article today, I would say they need
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.800]   to figure out a way to reduce the risks and to enhance the benefits, because I think,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.160]   again, if they move it to the iCloud server and stop scanning on the phone, then I would
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.040]   say the risks are very well under control.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.360]   I don't think anybody would object to that, because what everybody does.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.640]   I was just trying to make the point that there's a really good reason to do this.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.920]   I also made the point that there are always risks at any form of the bill.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.280]   Look, I've got a doorbell camera.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.480]   I think it has great benefits, but does that mean that if you decide to walk in front of
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.440]   my house with somebody you shouldn't be with, that your privacy could be invaded?
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   Absolutely.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.400]   We have to figure out all of these trade-offs in the world that we live in right now.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.760]   Apple, obviously, feeling the heat, they were planning to roll this out with iOS 15, which
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.040]   I'm going to guess would have rolled out this month.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.840]   I think that's pretty safe.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.480]   I have decided to delay it.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.800]   I don't know if they're going to wait until the heat goes off in the do it, or if they
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.680]   want to find a better way to do it.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.560]   Maybe my guess at what Apple did not want to do what you suggested, Larry, because ultimately
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.000]   they'd like to have end-to-end encryption on iCloud so that they can avoid subpoenas
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.720]   from law enforcement in this country and other countries.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.640]   They can avoid that whole thing by putting end-to-end encryption on iCloud, which means
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.080]   the only way they could find those images is on their way in or on their way out.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.000]   By the way, encryption is having been on the board of the National Center.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.200]   Most of my colleagues were very anti-encryption.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.360]   I argued that encryption actually protects children along with everyone else, so that
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.880]   there are pros and cons from the safety standpoint.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   Forget other issues.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.960]   From a safety standpoint, there are advantages to encryption as well as some risks that it
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.760]   brings in, or at least hamperings of law enforcement.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.640]   I think that could be that-
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   No, please.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:15.720]   That Apple's rationale was based on this reductionist lack of nuance conversation that has happened
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.160]   with their peers, particularly Facebook.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.520]   Their peers also acquire the language around safety and encryption to talk about how your
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.240]   content is protected.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.120]   But there really has been an un-nuance debate about this exact topic.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.040]   Many of Apple's peers have confused it and harmed public trust.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:45.280]   It could have been that Apple was maybe trying to do exactly what you suggested.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.680]   I don't know, but I think it could have been that they're looking for a simpler solution.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.600]   I'm not sure who you're talking about.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.840]   Facebook is getting a lot of flack from law enforcement and many in the child safety community,
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.840]   not me but others.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.040]   I was talking about Facebook specifically.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.280]   I think another end, Google, anyone who's dealing encryption is bound to get flack from law
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.520]   enforcement and some people in child protection.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.760]   And they don't want to get flack from everybody else.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:20.080]   But Facebook reported more than 20 million images matching the Nick McData base in 2020.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.280]   Apple reported 256.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   20 million from Facebook, 256 from Apple.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   I think that number alone was one of the reasons Apple said we got to do something.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.560]   This does not look good, if nothing else.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.080]   The optics are the myth.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.560]   The main question here, from my perspective, is where's the consistency for Apple?
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.600]   So if we look back to the time where the company had the showdown with the FBI over the San
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:51.960]   Bernardino terrorists' phone, the key wasn't, should we protect this data that could potentially
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:57.480]   lead us to solve what might be a terrorist network operating in the US or foil the next
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480]   attack?
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.920]   Apple's argument was if we are to create this key, we are going to create this opportunity
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.200]   for it to be used in the future for things that are not this specific.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.520]   We're going to open the door.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.640]   So therefore, we're not touching this at all.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:19.200]   And while this is a valiant attempt, it doesn't sync with the same logic they had back with
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.160]   the FBI case where they're not going to allow anything to happen on device because you don't
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.960]   know what it's going to be used for next.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.240]   And I think that was really getting into trouble.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.040]   But the EFF and many experts were worried about with Apple's scanning on the phone is
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.880]   that then the government could come to Apple and say, "Well, by the way, we'd also like
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:42.680]   you to find images of gay kissing or something if it's Saudi Arabia."
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.640]   And as a result, that would be problematic.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.320]   There were other issues as well.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.600]   In fact, one of the things Apple seems to cite is that some of the technology, there were
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:56.160]   a lot of technologists using these neural hashes who said, "You're going to have a problem.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.600]   It's not that accurate."
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.360]   The Apple said specifically, "We want to make improvements before releasing these critically
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.440]   important child safety features."
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.440]   It's interesting.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.800]   Neck-Mac warned Apple at the very beginning, this was another thing that lit a bit of a
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:18.120]   fire saying, "You're going to hear, 'Was it Larry shrieking commentators decrying what
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.120]   you're doing?
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   Pay no attention to them.'"
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.320]   Well, that may have been a mistaken neck-neck again.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.800]   I stepped down from the board a year ago.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.880]   I can't take any responsibility.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.360]   There are people who neck-neck who get it and there are people who don't.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:39.360]   The ones who get it understand that we cannot use child protection as an excuse for surveillance.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.920]   In 2012, I was supposed to give two speeches in Moscow.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:51.400]   I gave my first speech to a group of basically NGOs where I argued that you cannot combine
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.000]   child protection or child pornography with other harms.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.280]   That was exactly what Putin and his team were doing.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.480]   It's worse than anything else is what you're saying.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.920]   You got to just focus on that.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.480]   But Putin and company created this law that lumped all of these things, terrorism, child
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.160]   pornography, extremism into one law.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   And guess what?
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.680]   The next speech I was supposed to give suddenly they ran out of time right before I was about
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   to speak.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.800]   Now we're going to be a big government televised event.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.520]   They didn't like my message.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.240]   Wow, that's pretty blatant.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.040]   But so you're making the point that Apple's running.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.800]   By the way, Apple may back down at this point or delay it, but by having announced that
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   they can do it, they've already opened the door to this.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.760]   Because in effect, you said, "Well, we could do it."
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.520]   And Russia or Saudi Arabia or China could use that as, "Well, we know you can do it,
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.520]   so do it."
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.240]   It also makes you wonder what's actually behind the privacy messaging that Apple's been pushing
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.480]   at us for the last few years.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.080]   Is this actually a message based off of principles and values?
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.760]   Or is it a convenient marketing message to help position the iPhone against Facebook and
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.440]   the iPhone against Android?
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.440]   That's why I brought up consistency earlier.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.860]   If you're consistent with it, we can say, "Okay, these are your values."
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.480]   But if you say privacy for this, but not for that, and that's what Apple stands for, privacy,
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.160]   then you have to start scratching your head and you say, "Maybe this company isn't as
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.040]   devoted to privacy as a value as we once thought."
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.640]   Now, of course, Leo, you mentioned that this is not something that anybody would want.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.560]   We wouldn't want these images out there at all.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.960]   Well, that's the question.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.760]   We have privacy and block child pornography at the same time.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.880]   Well, you can have full safety in a society and be under authoritarian rule.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.720]   And it's always a balance of how much safety do you want and how authoritarian do you
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   want to be?
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   Exactly.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.200]   It's not a frickin' way.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:58.080]   This exact same debate is raging internally with Apple right now with their own employees.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.880]   And they've had significant issues with the Apple II movement, share Scarlet coming forward
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:09.360]   over the last couple of weeks and talking about how, look, there can be privacy for some
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.680]   things and security for some things at Apple.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:17.040]   In fact, she told me, we have privacy and security for our devices and our products, but
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.640]   not our people or people are exposed if they speak out against Apple.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:28.080]   And I think that this Alex consistency is the exact same at the core, the exact same
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.640]   argument that's happening with Apple right now with their own employees.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.160]   That's an exciting point.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.880]   Yeah, it's a fascinating moment for Apple because from my understanding, they've, there've
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.360]   been departments inside the company that have deployed Slack.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.440]   And when you put these messaging apps inside a company, all these things that you used
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.280]   to have in terms of culture, whether it was top-down leadership or silos like Apple has
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:57.560]   had or a culture where you don't ask questions to people above you, which Apple has had, that
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.680]   falls by the wayside.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.160]   So I think we're entering an extremely fascinating moment for this company where we see whether
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   it can maintain this siloed secretive culture, one that doesn't empower employees to speak
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   up unlike Facebook and Google, or whether Apple shuts down Slack and says, "We're going
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.120]   to keep doing things the way we've been doing and how that impacts employee morale."
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.520]   So the cat's been let out of the bag and I kind of think it's an exciting moment because
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.840]   their culture did need to be tested and I'm glad to see that we're starting to see anything
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   of that.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.720]   You're probably referring to the fact that Apple, which uses Slack for internal messaging,
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.880]   banned a Slack channel that was talking about pay equity.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.240]   I'm saying we don't allow personal conversations on our business Slack.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:46.360]   Meanwhile, there's a dogs channel and others that they did not ban.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:55.840]   So not only did they ban it, they used a completely pathetic excuse for doing so.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:02.840]   Apple employees have Slack channels to discuss #fundogs, more than 5,000 members, #gaming3,000
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840]   members.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:10.600]   There's a 2,000 member dad jokes channel, but don't have a channel discussing pay equity.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.800]   In partial defense for example, not around the pay equity issue, but around the whole
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:21.440]   issue of encryption and data collection, the entire safety community that I'm very much
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.120]   part of deals with nuances.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:30.000]   So for example, as an ACLU member, I feel very, very strongly about free speech, but I also
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.760]   feel very strongly about hate speech and about misinformation.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.040]   Of course, the ACLU is famous for defending the Skokie, Illinois, Nazis.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.040]   Exactly.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:45.520]   In other words, there are competing rights or competing issues that aside from any commercial
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.280]   questions, aside from the fact whether these are greedy corporations trying to extract
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.760]   every possible penny, these companies, and I can't speak so much for Apple because they're
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.200]   not one of our partners, but certainly Facebook, Twitter, Google, companies we do work with
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.680]   Microsoft, they do struggle with these questions of how do we balance these competing rights,
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   you know, right of safety.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.720]   The difference is, as Alex has pointed out, they don't have big advertisements saying
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.440]   what happens in your iPhone stays on your iPhone.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440]   Exactly.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   That's true too.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:22.760]   Apple's kind of walked into this buzzsaw and so for me as you Larry, is it compatible?
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.240]   Privacy of your device and protecting his child sexual abuse material?
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.760]   Are those, I understand you're saying it's nuanced.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.760]   You have to weigh them.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.240]   It's like they're direct odds.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.680]   I mean, what I do on my phone is private.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   It's my personal phone.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.040]   People are, this is the problem, part of the problem is this is a new device, it's a new
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.760]   concept that I would store such personal stuff on a device that's always connected to
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:52.920]   the internet, has a microphone, a camera and a GPS is right there, this kind of paradox.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.440]   They are in conflict, but it's not as if at law enforcement has no resources at all.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.480]   I mean, there's metadata for example, which can be used.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.760]   I mean, it's not unlike the whole wiretapping rules.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.880]   I mean, how you, what you can access and what you can't and law enforcement, I'm sure if
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.760]   they could, would love to have a complete access to every device in the world.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.120]   They don't, but they still have tools that they can use to bust bad guys.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.760]   It's just going to be harder for them, not because we want to make their job harder,
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.720]   but because we want to, as much as possible, protect the rights of citizens.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   Balance privacy is what the Constitution is all about.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:35.240]   It's privacy because the founders were concerned about the king of England going to their home
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.760]   and looking for stuff.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.120]   That's why there's a Fourth Amendment and they balance this need for law enforcement
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.120]   versus this need.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.120]   Exactly.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:50.560]   And constitutional right, not just need, but a right to privacy of your personal effects.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.120]   I guess the courts can weigh in on this.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.560]   That's certainly part of their job.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.400]   I don't know.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.720]   I don't know where I stand on this.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.160]   No one's supporting CSAM.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.920]   No one's supporting these horrible people in their, in what they do.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.880]   And by the way, Apple didn't roll it out.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.000]   They preannounced it.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.200]   So you might argue, as John Gruber on daring fireball has, is this is exactly what Apple's
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.040]   intent was to start this conversation.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.120]   So it may not be that Apple was acting irresponsibly that they were saying, well, we want to do
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.120]   this.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   What do you think?
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   I think it's a third.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.800]   And admittedly, late afternoon on Friday and a long weekend, maybe it's not the most
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:39.040]   newsworthy time to announce an embarrassing backing down, but they did back down.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.920]   Now we'll see what happens in the long run.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:47.640]   They also, and Larry, I got to ask you this, they also told us how if you're a child pornography,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   you can avoid it.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.040]   Just turn off iCloud photos and it doesn't happen.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.160]   Yeah, and you can find another way to share the data like through an encrypted service.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:02.200]   So it's not as if, and that's interesting, you point that out because this material will
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.080]   exist with or without what Apple is planning on doing.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.680]   And unfortunately, these guys will go to any links to get this, to share this kind of material.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.640]   So what's the point of even trying to enforce this?
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.160]   I mean, I would, I don't know, maybe child pornography is a particularly stupid people,
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.360]   but it's not going to, maybe they're not.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.520]   I mean, I have to admit, I've told this story before, but when Patrick Norton and I were
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.920]   talking to the Secret Service about forensics and so forth, one of the guys said, you know,
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.760]   the truth is most crooks are stupid and we'll even just hand you the password.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.240]   So you don't, you know, most cases, it's easy to catch these guys.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:45.840]   I don't know if that's true now, but Apple, it sounds like, to be honest, Apple was doing
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.520]   this for PR because there is a way to turn it off.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.600]   And somebody who's actually doing this by pre-enouncing it, they're saying, hey, you know, if you
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   want to keep doing it, turn off iCloud photo.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.760]   So it's going to have zero impact in enforcement.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.160]   It's a public relations move.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.840]   Much like most of their proclamations on privacy over the past few years.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.800]   And the only real problem is it's a PR move in the contradiction to what they've been saying
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.160]   up to now.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.120]   In both cases, it's PR, it's marketing.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.720]   Your iCloud was never private, by the way.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.400]   In fact, that's what they told the San Bernadine, the FBI in the San Bernadine.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   Okay.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.880]   So they said, had you brought the phone back to his house, it probably would have connected
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.120]   to iCloud and synced up.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.400]   And we would have been glad to hand that data over.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.600]   Or they would have been forced to even if they didn't do it voluntarily.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.600]   Yeah, maybe they're not glad.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.760]   I can't, I can't impute their feelings about it.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.080]   But we know that they hand over often.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.600]   Hand over data from the cloud.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   Sure.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   Because they have to.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   And that's the thing.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.000]   And the problem is if it's encrypted on its way to the cloud, you know, it may be impenetrable.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And that's the problem for law enforcement.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.320]   I think that I honestly think that Apple and they haven't said this, wanted to turn
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.840]   on end to end encryption for the cloud.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.080]   They had to mention this before.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   And apparently, according to some sources, were talked out of it by the FBI.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.760]   But I think Apple would, and maybe the plan was for Apple to turn that on and say, but
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.040]   look, we're giving law enforcement a way to scan this before it gets to the cloud.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.360]   And that's all we're going to give them.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.880]   So maybe this was all about protecting privacy.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.120]   What if somebody steals your phone?
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.400]   Can they can they get access to this kind of data?
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.600]   No, that's the whole point.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.920]   That's why that that's why the FBI, Sam Bernier case was such a big deal.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:38.160]   Apple said under no circumstances, are we going to allow even law enforcement to unlock
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   that phone?
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.320]   That phone is sacrosanct.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.560]   It's encrypted.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.040]   Right.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.560]   So what about that, Alex?
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.760]   Maybe this is more PR.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.960]   Yeah, look, I mean, I think that it's very reasonable that we brought up Facebook as the
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.520]   other company that we're comparing Apple to when it comes to detecting these images.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.400]   I'll tell you why.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.360]   Apple and Facebook are competitors in ways that people don't speak about enough.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.280]   We talk about Apple and Android.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.180]   The truth is that Facebook has the set of messaging apps that will allow people to
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.960]   unhook themselves from the Apple ecosystem and move to Android.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:15.560]   In fact, they're probably going to prevent a lot of iPhone penetration in countries where
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.840]   WhatsApp is strong because you use your phone message for messaging primarily.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.040]   It's the most important thing you do on your phone.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.960]   And so Apple sees Facebook as this ultimate competitor.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.400]   That's why you've seen all these ads about what happens on your iPhone, stays on your
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.000]   iPhones because the company is positioning itself against Facebook because it doesn't
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.080]   want you using those messaging apps.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.720]   So you stay on iPhones and you stay on iPhones and you keep upgrading.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   You buy your next Mac and you buy your next iPhone and the list goes on.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.560]   And so, yeah, I mean, I think that when it comes to PR, that's why privacy has been
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.200]   the moment I've been hinting at it at this point, but I might as well say it explicitly.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.240]   I think that's why privacy has been at the core of Apple's marketing efforts, Facebook
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.880]   number one, and then of course, you know, positioning itself against Android number two
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.400]   to make itself a luxury product.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.440]   And so at the end of the day, Leo, I think what you're pointing on is extremely salient
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.560]   and sort of core to the whole deal with Apple at this point, which is that the company
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:17.680]   is going to scare you about the other companies privacy in order to keep you inside its ecosystem
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.600]   in order to keep Facebook weak and under the gaze of regulators and third parties, while
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.560]   Apple sits out and says, okay, I'm doing good.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.200]   And to reduce Facebook to an app that sits on the iPhone.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   Correct.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.760]   Sorry, I think I think what we're seeing here.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.800]   It gives you the question as much for an iPhone than an Android phone.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   Yes, everybody together.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.960]   This is great privacy.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.360]   And so I think what we've seen here is exactly the case.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.280]   It's Apple all of a sudden, and that's again, it comes to consistency.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.920]   Apple tried to make this PR move, showed that it was inconsistent, that it didn't really
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.280]   care as much about the privacy as it might actually be saying.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.480]   And it was all about the public relations and the marketing impact.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.000]   You know, Steve Jobs back in that they said, said marketing is all about who you are and
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.360]   what you stand for.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   Right.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.000]   And they're trying to say they stand for privacy.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.720]   But when you start to peel back the layers a little bit, you see that this isn't exactly
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.320]   the big angel that it makes itself out to be.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.640]   And that's I think what's being exposed in this moment.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.080]   That's the real bottom line of all this.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.800]   Let me read you two quotes from an Apple employee.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.920]   And this, you know, going back to the point of this is a critical juncture for this company.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.240]   I mean, first of all, they're never going to invite me to anything ever again.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   I mean, look, when I was at CNET, I couldn't report on Apple for obvious reasons.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.560]   But now that I'm at a news company, let's talk about some things that are happening
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   there.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.560]   One is that they never leak.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.160]   They never leaked, at least in any usable way.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   Now they do.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.600]   Their employees leak quite a bit.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.000]   Let me read you these two quotes that I think are pretty important.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.680]   The culture of secrecy is great for protecting our products and for protecting our users.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:04.920]   But if our own employees cannot speak out about sexual harassment or unequal pay, then
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.720]   it works to the company's advantage and not yours.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.200]   You become a target.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.120]   You are unsafe.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.720]   This is an Apple employee who said this.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.760]   Let me read you another quote from her.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:21.400]   Non-white, non-male employees at Apple are at a financial and decision-making disadvantage
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.240]   because these people are terrified of retribution.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.640]   That's a direct quote from an Apple employee.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.080]   I'm an Apple consumer.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.400]   Yeah, I feel guilty because I have a lot of Apple stuff.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   I have to say-
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.800]   This is two.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.840]   Two Alex's point about consistency and about how their own employees feel.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.520]   The safety of their own employees is right now it's a raging issue.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.160]   It's a really challenging time for this company.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.480]   The position themselves is like the one golden angel in Silicon Valley.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.880]   I've avoided talking about this because labor issues are complicated.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.680]   There's two signs off of the company cannot express its side.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   It's difficult.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.880]   In our Apple coverage, we've kind of pressed-
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   Okay.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   No, no, no.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.880]   I'm not saying to stop.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.240]   I'm just saying why we haven't covered this more.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.120]   But you have been and you've been digging.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.080]   Is it your opinion that this is actually-
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.840]   This is a widespread problem in Apple.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.680]   This isn't just a few-
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.400]   Let me tell you.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.920]   Another share came forward in early August and looked at the Verge covered a bunch of
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.000]   other sources outlets covered this.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.960]   I'm certainly not alone and I haven't done the vast majority of this.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.920]   I think the Verge has done great reporting on it.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.400]   Share said after she came out with her initial reports that a thousand other Apple employees
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.480]   came forward to her, she put my phone number and I'm sure she's done this with many other
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.480]   journalists.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.040]   It's not me.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.000]   It's many people covering Apple.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.960]   She put my phone number in a spreadsheet and it's now being shared with a number of people
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.960]   at Apple.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.800]   I mean, not my phone or it's my Google voice, but they call and leave voicemails.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.320]   Yeah, this is why it's spread at Apple.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.040]   Look, it's dangerous to talk like this about Apple.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:15.440]   Share Scarlett has been doxxed and harassed because you don't want to upset Apple people.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.440]   Not by the company.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.160]   I don't know if the company's harassed or by outsized.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.360]   It is literally dangerous.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   It's weird.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.880]   I mean, people, yeah, it's a covering Apple like this.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.600]   This is an unprecedented moment in that company's history.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:35.240]   This is why you don't sad to say in this day and age, you don't be careful not to come
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   forward about anything.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:42.080]   This is why when somebody does come forward, it's worth crediting them because it is and
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.840]   they know it is a dangerous thing, whether it's me too or Apple to, it's a dangerous thing
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.680]   to step forward.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:55.960]   Okay, so this is, you know, we'll probably cover it more now because it's clearly become
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.280]   an issue with Apple.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.840]   Is the shine come off the Apple?
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.680]   Is this going to hurt them as a business or no?
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.040]   They're on their way to a $3 trillion market cap.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.520]   I'll buy the next iPhone.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.480]   Yeah, see, this is the problem.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.320]   Right there in a nutshell.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:23.520]   Well, you know, a lot of people will buy the next iPhone and I think that's fine.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.200]   But I keep hoping we'll get to a point where people actually look at these devices and
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.920]   realize that they're paying a lot of money for sort of spin and polish and marketing.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.920]   And, you know, this is the best iPhone ever.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.440]   Well, of course, it's the best iPhone at birth, the newest iPhone.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.760]   But I mean, there's some great alternatives out there.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.440]   Is Android from any manufacturer?
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.480]   Let me, Dan, you used to in an earlier life used to teach dissidents in countries where
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.360]   it was dangerous to be a dissident how to protect themselves.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.880]   Would you say to them use an iPhone?
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.560]   Yeah, because I mean, risky.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.640]   I have colleagues who do far more of this than I do, but I've spent time in Darfur.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:10.880]   I've spent time in Cairo, in Ukraine and places where your device security is your personal
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   security.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   Yep.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:17.200]   I spent, I mean, not long, just a couple of weeks in Cairo teaching these Sudanese guys
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.680]   how to use security and encryption.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:25.480]   And in fact, we brought them Android phones because you could put Tor on an Android phone.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:29.800]   But we demonstrated everything on an iPhone and my personal advice was an iPhone.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.200]   Now you still have to use good operational security.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.720]   You still have to use a VPN.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.160]   You never touch a Wi-Fi network, never touch the actual mobile network itself.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.920]   You know, do all of your good, up-seck stuff.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.440]   But I don't know how it is today.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.520]   I think I would take a Samsung with Knox maybe.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.480]   But I still would feel better taking an iPhone.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.440]   I don't think I would go to Russia with any kind of phone.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.360]   But also, I mean, it was creepy enough.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.440]   It's, I think talking about locations is important, right?
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.480]   There are some places where you might want an iPhone above an Android.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.440]   There are some places you definitely want an Android above an iPhone.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440]   You'll be a target.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:13.360]   Well, one thing we've learned with the NSO group at Pegasus is that the iPhones are
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.960]   routinely and easily hacked by nation states.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:24.920]   And as far as I can tell, Google doesn't have a server stored on another government's
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.040]   property where the New York Times reported recently that Apple does have some of its
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:36.320]   servers in a data warehouse that they rent from a Chinese government subsidiary.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.400]   So this question has become far more complicated over time.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   And largely, the factor from where I said is the Chinese government's relationship with
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.040]   Apple and Apple's relationship with the Chinese government.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.920]   And once you have those phones, I think it is just the phones in China.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:58.160]   But once you have those phones sitting in those data servers then, or the iCloud sitting
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:04.720]   in those servers, you know, all of a sudden moves to who is the Chinese government going
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.280]   to want to help.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.120]   And it's not just China, it's China and its allies.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.240]   And you end up in a pretty complicated web that doesn't make it as simple as it might
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.400]   have one spin to say, you know, if you want security, go to the iPhone over the Android.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.800]   It's actually complicated because Google doesn't do business in China.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.640]   So there really is no phone you could buy in China that is invaded by the Chinese government.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.000]   That's just a given.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.640]   And so your opposite is going to have to consider that.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.000]   And obviously you keep everything encrypted.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.320]   You don't put anything online at all if I were there.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   We're lucky.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.320]   We're fat and happy.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.600]   We could sit here and not worry so much about the security of our phone.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.800]   For the average American or Western consumer, the difference in your iPhone and Android
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.160]   is not significant.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.240]   But that's not the case.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   And you're right.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   It depends on where you are.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:59.240]   And you're actually right when you travel internationally, I mean, when I was in China,
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.960]   I was certainly aware that I could not trust, I think I had an Android with me at the time,
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.560]   but I could not trust any security on that phone.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.800]   And I just, and I took some stuff off the phone before I got to China.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   Well, take everything off.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.160]   Well, before you go through US Customs, you might want to take everything off your phone.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.160]   Again, yeah.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.160]   Because it's just as intrusive.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.120]   Yeah, I, somebody, periodically I get calls from people saying, I'm going to China.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.400]   What VPN should I use?
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.840]   And while there are some VPNs that work in China, I always tell them, don't use a VPN.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.440]   You're going to China, you are going to be under the rules of the Chinese government.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.640]   It would be rude to try to sneak around their rules.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:44.480]   It might also be dangerous, probably not as a US tourist, but don't, you know, just understand
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   you're surveilled.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:52.200]   Used to be when you go to Russia, there'd be a minder on the floor of every hotel.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.040]   And that person is watching you're coming and going.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.600]   Just accept that, that that is part of where you are.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.160]   You don't try to get around it.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.120]   That's just a red flag, if you ask me.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.400]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.080]   There's a lot more to talk about.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.080]   Well, this is good.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.080]   We're going to do that.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.600]   We're going to do the big, heavy news stuff because we've got a great panel for that.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.120]   Alex Cantor, which says here, big technology podcast.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.520]   And of course his newsletter, bigtechnology.substech.com.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:27.360]   These day one, his book, absolutely a must read.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   Thanks for being here.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   It's great to have you.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.560]   Larry Maggett from the National, formerly of the National Center for Missing Exploited
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:40.920]   Children Now Connect Safely.org with a similar message to protect kids online and a regular
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.240]   in various venues.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.960]   You still do some stuff on CBS, yeah?
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.040]   I'm still on CBS News twice a week.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.280]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:54.120]   And speaking of CBS from CBS News, our friend Dan Patterson, technology reporter there.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.200]   A long time, all three of you, long time friends of the network.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.480]   Always great to have all three of you on our show today brought to you by Udacity.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.960]   This is a great story.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.960]   I love this story.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.440]   Udacity was created in 2011.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.720]   It's exactly 10 years old.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.440]   Sebastian Thrun, who was a Google engineer realized that they weren't the people that
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.320]   were applying for jobs at Google might have had the best degrees and the best pedigrees,
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   but they didn't have the knowledge Google needed.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:25.560]   He said, "We got to do a better job in getting people ready for jobs in big tech."
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.720]   He created Udacity and Udacity is famous for its nanodegrees.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.560]   Originally with Google, but now nanodegrees are created for Udacity with companies like
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.760]   Microsoft and IBM and Amazon as well as Google.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:43.680]   In fact, the teachers you'll have at this incredible part-time online educational program
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.360]   are often team leads from these top companies because they know what needs to be done.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.080]   This is a very practical education.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:55.760]   If you love learning and you're always looking to learn more tech stuff, Udacity is for you,
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.400]   even if you're not looking for a job in the field.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.840]   But if you are, take a look at those cutting edge nanodegree programs.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.680]   They've got programs, they've got class.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.400]   You can't take anywhere else, AI, deep learning.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.960]   How'd you like to be an autonomous flight engineer for flying cars?
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.640]   They've got a degree for that.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.160]   Intro to self-driving cars, machine learning engineer.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.000]   My personal choice, I'd want to be a robotics software engineer.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.600]   I just love the idea.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.360]   I've taken Python classes.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.080]   They're fantastic.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:30.120]   The thing I really like best about Udacity is the courses are project-based.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.920]   Hands-on learning.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.040]   It's not just going and watching videos.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.000]   You're actually going to be tested.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.800]   You're going to have to use what you've learned to create a project.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   All your homework and your project reviewed by qualified professionals, the code reviews,
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.280]   just like you would have if you were working at these big companies.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.080]   Cutting edge technology, you'll get real human feedback, you'll get reviews, and of course
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   you're not on your own.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.760]   They have access to mentors 24/7.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.080]   Udacity knows that it's important to be flexible and easy for students.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.720]   You could put in as little as five to ten hours a week, work at your own pace any time
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.960]   of the day or night.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   You graduate as little as three months.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.000]   You also have flexible payment options.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.600]   They have free courses you can learn at your own pace and on your own schedule.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.720]   Udacity is very, very popular with people who love technology.

[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.400]   Wow, wow.

[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:39.320]   My point out, World Economic Forum says that 75 million current jobs will be gone in the
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:44.400]   next three years replaced by automated processes.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.880]   Maybe you are in that job that's going to disappear.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880]   Maybe I am.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:53.480]   Maybe it's time to learn some skills that will stay with you during the future, the new
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   future.

[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   You're doing a good job getting people up-skilled.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.760]   Oh boy.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.440]   Oh boy.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.720]   Oh boy.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.040]   Oh, let's see.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.560]   I guess if we stick with Apple, I could mention the fact that Apple is now facing a little
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   challenge in South Korea.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.280]   I don't know if this has been signed yet.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.080]   It will almost certainly be signed into law.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   It's been passed by both houses of the South Korean legislature requiring Apple and Google
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.040]   to allow third-party app payments.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.320]   This is something Apple and Google have both fought vigorously in South Korea trying to
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.800]   protect their 30% cut of all app payments.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.160]   And I believe, I think it's fair to say this is the first domino because everybody's looking
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:50.720]   at this, including the FTC and the United States DOJ and Congress.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.880]   Apple says you're going to destroy this platform and you can destroy our security.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.560]   You can't do this.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.040]   Google hasn't said, I don't think, honestly, it changes much for Google since they've always
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.440]   allowed sideloading.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.760]   Apple also says, hey, it's fine.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.560]   We'll just bill you.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:17.360]   So if you are, let's say, Epic's Fortnite and you decide to use Stripe for in-app payments,
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:22.360]   Apple says that's fine.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   We're still going to bill you 30%.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.080]   I don't know how that's going to work.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.080]   I don't know what's going to happen in Korea.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.080]   What's that?
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   What's that 30% getting you then?
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   I don't understand.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   I thought the 30% was for security.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   So if you use Stripe, Apple's going to bill you 30%.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.080]   Yeah, you pay 30% so you can sell, so you can put it on the app store.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.800]   But yeah, I guess if this is it.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.360]   It had sideloading, but I guess you make a point.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.680]   We have this drives me nuts.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:52.000]   We have a vicious debate going on a Mac break weekly because Alex Lindsey says, look, you're
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.960]   getting, I've sold software.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:59.360]   This is a huge improvement over the old system where you'd have to print up discs and put
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.880]   them in a box with a manual and get it on the store shelves and they'd still take 50%
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.800]   or more to do it.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.160]   This is a huge improvement.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.800]   Apple hosts it.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.200]   They market it for you a little bit.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.480]   They make it possible and they only take a mere 30%.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:21.360]   It does feel if your Netflix or Amazon selling books or it does seem like rent seeking a
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.520]   little bit because after all, Netflix doesn't need Apple's platform to get people to subscribe
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   to Netflix.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.720]   It's a good question.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:35.400]   If Netflix used a third party, yeah, you Stripe or some other third party or PayPal, some
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:41.920]   third parties payment system, Apple be giving them no benefit really.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   And why should you?
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.480]   The main reason you want to watch Netflix is at home on your big screen TV, but you're
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.160]   buying it on Apple's platform.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.160]   Netflix loses 30%.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:54.520]   It actually costs us in some ways because many, many companies, if not all, if not most,
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.280]   will add that 30% to the cost.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.560]   You'll see the differential sometimes.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.800]   If you buy on a website, it's 30% less than if you buy it on iPhone.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.760]   And that remembering used argument Epic used.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.760]   Right.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.760]   It's costing consumers.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:11.520]   Not years ago, you had to sideload Amazon apps onto iPhones if I'm not mistaken.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.120]   I'm not remembering that right.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.480]   You never could have sideload it, but what Amazon did if you had the Kindle app and you
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.920]   wanted a book, you would have to exit the app, launch Safari, buy it through Safari,
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.120]   then it would be available in your app.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:31.840]   And that thing, I think that's still the case for Kindle, not for Audible.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.640]   Amazon has made some deal with Apple.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.200]   That's another argument, by the way, that I mean, there's the consistency thing again,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   right?
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.680]   We're talking about these applications of the fees.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.440]   I mean, we can debate about the amount of fee, which is a different argument, but it
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.440]   is this consistency.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.240]   And Leo, you're exactly right.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.960]   Apple did make deals with some companies.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:46:00.200]   And to Larry's point, they were pretty nuclear with Amazon, like no go, no go, until they
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.160]   quietly made some changes in Audible.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.400]   Now, you can't purchase things in Audible, but you can't apply your credits in Audible.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.120]   And they're sneaking things coming into the Amazon app too.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.880]   So really, it's, it's, although we could be frustrated at the policies, I'm more frustrated
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.000]   at the inconsistency of the policies.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.920]   I'm the same frustrated at Facebook, Twitter, and all other big tech companies.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.600]   I'm sure it, I'm not the only one here.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:30.520]   I think there's a guy who has a podcast in a newsletter about big technology might agree
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.520]   with you.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.520]   That's all right.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.520]   I'm trying to.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.520]   No, it's all right.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.920]   I'm sure you're coming on to the turf.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.720]   Yeah, it's great to have you here.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.720]   No, it really is.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.400]   No, I think you're making great points.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.720]   And I live in the same side of the street, man.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.720]   That's right.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.840]   Apple said this is all about, this is all about security.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.160]   So here's an idea.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.600]   Why does an Apple give iPhone users one option to go through Apple Pay and use the App Store
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.040]   payment system and give like a verified check next to it?
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.040]   So you can be comfortable with security.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.040]   I think that's what they're going to do.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.040]   That's an end with another one.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.320]   And then another one and say, okay, if you want to take a risk and you're not going to
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.320]   pay as much, go ahead.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.320]   Go on there.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   I mean, this is all about, it should be at the end of the day about the customers.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.960]   All these companies talk ad nauseam about the customers, but it's really about their
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:17.960]   bottom line.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.960]   That's about users.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.960]   I will defend.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:23.520]   I will, I'm going to, since nobody else will, I'll defend Apple.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:29.080]   I kind of agree with you guys, but I will, I will take this role because it is an important
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.720]   point.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:36.160]   Apple says, look, we're doing what is easiest and best for the customer.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.680]   Customers don't want these switches.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.480]   They don't want this confusing effect on Android.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.600]   You can sideload.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.120]   You can press a button.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.040]   Android warns you this is insecure.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.040]   It's dangerous.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.480]   In fact, they've even changed its behavior.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.280]   It doesn't no longer stays.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.360]   The checkbox no longer stays on the buy on third party stores.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.600]   It only is for that one purchase.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.000]   Apple says we could do that, but that's confusing to people.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.800]   It's not a good experience.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:09.800]   By the way, there's, you got, look, they're not an almost $3 trillion company for nothing.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:13.720]   For most users, Apple is the painless way to go.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:19.320]   But if security was the only issue, you could have third party organizations, companies.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.200]   I don't think that they say security, but I don't think it's really, I think what they
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.800]   really say is we want the best experience for customers, which includes security, but
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.840]   is more than just security.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:34.920]   What is Apple saying that its customers are sophisticated and smart enough to walk into
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:40.520]   one of its stores and pay $2,000 for a laptop or a phone, but not sophisticated or smart
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:45.120]   enough to be able to make a very simple choice between Apple's secure payment system and
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.800]   the rest of the web?
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.120]   Channeling Tim Cook.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.240]   That's why they pay $2,000 for a laptop or $1,200 for a phone.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.240]   No.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:02.040]   We're going to give them a good experience.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.960]   We're going to take the stress out of their life.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   I have a PC which costs a lot less than $2,000 and I have a web browser which takes me anywhere
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:06.960]   I want to go.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.760]   It doesn't take a genius to know the difference between going to an insecure place to buy
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.200]   your stuff and a secure place or at least a reputable place.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:20.880]   It seems to me that most iPhone users are capable of choosing whatever source they want
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:26.320]   to go to of their apps based on in part it being reputable.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.720]   There are plenty of companies out there that I would trust that could go in the business
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.040]   of selling apps.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.040]   You know what?
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.280]   I would have to buy it right now.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.200]   I'm running the Epic Game Store on my Mac.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   Shocking.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   Shocking.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   Okay.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:47.440]   But don't close because it's only a better time before Apple comes for you and says,
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.680]   "I know."
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:54.280]   Because honestly, this was my fear when Apple announced the App Store on the Mac and Gatekeeper
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:50:00.080]   and they slowly whittled away your ability to say, "No, I want to be able to buy through."
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.360]   Eventually it's going to be for the same reason they do it on the iPhone.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.120]   Look, you can only get stuff from the App Store.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.480]   I think a desktop computing experience should be different.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:16.840]   I by the way now use Linux almost exclusively for that very reason.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:22.760]   But there are plenty of people, most normal people who want simple, clean.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.600]   And Alex Lindsay is the perfect example.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.600]   He says, "I try to buy everything in the App Store because then when I have a new Mac,
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.080]   it automatically updates.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.880]   I can buy it once and it runs on all my Macs.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   It's just simple."
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.640]   Because I guess we can buy the store.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.440]   You can buy apps from Microsoft.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.440]   Oh, come on.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.200]   The Windows Store is not comparable to the App Store on the Mac.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.320]   I'm going to say it's an option.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:48.480]   I think we would all buy Tim Cook's argument here if it was just you paid that $2,000 premium
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.280]   and you got the App Store and it was clean.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:54.840]   But the complicating factor here is the fact that Apple does make that 30% of each one
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.200]   of those purchases when you pay through them.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.960]   And Tim Cook has outlined the fact that Apple's new strategy is not necessarily device sale
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.720]   but it's software and services among which the App Store fees are, which meant it's part
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.720]   of that.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:12.160]   So, I think that it sort of comes down to are we buying the company's marketing messaging
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:16.000]   or are we looking at the financial statements or are we looking at what they tell analysts
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.960]   on earnings calls and giving that more weight, I think which we should do.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:20.960]   Let me be clear.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.760]   And they made all corporations.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.800]   If they're doing their job or doing this.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.800]   Totally.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:33.440]   Maximizing profits for the stakeholders and using marketing to make you feel good about
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.440]   it.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.280]   That's what the job of the corporation is.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:40.080]   Apple does it in a way that I personally feel a little better about.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.560]   I prefer their products.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:46.320]   I prefer the same experience Larry does and others do.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.480]   But it's the consistency of that applied experience.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.320]   And my agency in that experience, I think it takes away my agency in a lot of ways that
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.760]   that they don't really tell us or disclose.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.120]   Steve Jobs is famous for that.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:05.200]   His opinion was we will pick the right way and you will do it that way.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:11.760]   Back down to the original Macintosh which had obscure screws so nobody could open it.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.720]   Those Torx screws for a long time foiled people who wanted to get into their Macintosh.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.200]   It didn't last forever.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.160]   But that was intentional on Steve's part.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.960]   They said we could put normal structures on there and he said, "No, no, no.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.960]   I don't want anybody opening this beautiful work of art."
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.800]   And the reason why this is moving from simple consumer choice to antitrust territory is
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.960]   because the system has worked well.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.360]   I don't think anyone's going to argue about that but does it ice out potential new businesses
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:43.120]   and small businesses and end up consolidating all the value that they're creating within
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:47.160]   one company that's using this approach as something of a monopoly.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.160]   I think you nailed that.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.120]   I think that's where Apple is getting into trouble.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:54.040]   And this is something consumers don't, it's not on their awareness.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.080]   They don't think about, "Well, why is zero rating bad for me?"
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.680]   They think, "Well, I'm getting Netflix free on my T-Mobile.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   That's good."
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:05.320]   They don't think about the fact that it stops anybody else from doing the next Netflix,
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.120]   a better one.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:13.480]   And so the elimination of competition ultimately hurts us but it may not be apparent.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:19.720]   And that's why it's kind of our job to be the sand and the oyster and bug the hell out
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.920]   of you and say, "No, no, no.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:21.920]   You don't want this."
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.560]   It seems like a good thing.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:29.840]   It seems like the nice warm balmy bath of living in the Apple world is comfortable and
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.520]   cozy but you have to understand there's a price to be paid for that.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:40.360]   Steve Jobs himself is the king of being the person, people that push forward this idea
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.560]   that the customer won't tell you what they want.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.120]   You have to give it to them.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.000]   And so they made it up from a company.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   It worked.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.960]   Of course, it worked very well.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:56.040]   But yeah, just asking people to raise their hand to come up with the problem, the fact
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.800]   that they're paying a premium on these app stores.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.680]   We're not going to get far waiting for that.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.280]   As a user, as a...
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:11.920]   As what I would call a sophisticated user of technology, increasingly I am choosing a
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   path where I get to choose even if it's more work.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.720]   That's one of the reasons I use Linux because I want the agency.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.480]   I don't like it that Apple takes away my agency.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.760]   Yes, it's easy but I want the agency and I think in the long run that's better for me.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.120]   It might be that some of these things are...
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.120]   No, go ahead.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.200]   Are controversial because not...
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.000]   You are a sophisticated technology consumer but it might be that we're all more sophisticated
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.880]   than we were a decade ago.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.880]   And we're all asking questions or more people are asking questions and maybe they're asking
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:50.160]   more and they want more out of Big Tech than Big Tech has provided for us in the last
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.160]   decade or so.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.080]   Don't you think it might be that...
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:58.360]   It's unpopular for Congress to challenge Big Tech, don't you think?
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.360]   Maybe not.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.520]   You used to get how Congress challenges Big Tech.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.440]   They don't.
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:09.160]   They make a lot of noise about it but they don't effectively challenge what you're saying.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.240]   That's because Big Tech lobbies like hell and spends hundreds of...
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.080]   Especially the telecommunications businesses spend hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.880]   By the way, to illustrate Alex's comment about Steve Jobs, he used to quote Henry Ford saying
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.240]   that if I had asked people what they want in transportation, they would have said they
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.080]   want a faster horse.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:31.520]   And part of Apple's responsibility, all tech responsibility, was to lead by showing us a
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.520]   better way.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.640]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:40.800]   Is it their responsibility or is their responsibility merely to increase profits for stakeholders?
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:46.440]   Well, I'm talking about their responsibility to the customer or certainly what got Apple
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.040]   where they are was showing us a better way.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.440]   I mean, if you had asked me what I wanted in 2006, I would have wanted a better Blackberry
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.920]   because that's all I was thinking about.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   You didn't know any better.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:03.440]   Apple came up with something with miles ahead of that Blackberry.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:08.960]   There's got to be some middle ground where we can have innovation without crushing competition.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.680]   I think we're getting there.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.760]   What we saw with Apple making this move is one step towards that future.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:20.880]   And slowly but surely, they are going to be forced, whether it's through court or through
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:26.240]   public pressure, to step back a little bit from their draconian rules in the App Store.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.920]   And it's going to be better for everyone.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:32.120]   And then we're going to live in a world where it never rains and it's filled with rainbows
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.120]   and innovation.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.480]   I live in California where it never rains.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.440]   So let's not such a great world.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.320]   Well, you know what I'm saying.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   A nice world.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.760]   Just to show, just to prove anyway, we are an equal opportunity offender.
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.320]   I just want to point out, Microsoft had a little problem with Windows 11 this week.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.040]   You know, the next version of Windows 11 comes out.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.360]   Now we know October 5th.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:57.200]   So they're beta testing it actively within CIDR's.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.840]   And the insider preview build that came out this week had a little flaw.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:08.000]   Recently, Microsoft writes, Windows and CIDR's in both the dev and beta channels began reporting
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.040]   that the start and task bar were unresponsive and settings and other areas of the OS wouldn't
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   load.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.080]   We quickly discovered an issue.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.320]   This is why you do bug testing.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:24.200]   I got to say with a server side deployment, apparently they turned on an advertisement
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.640]   for Microsoft Teams.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.400]   And because the server that was serving the ad, it has to go out on the internet to get
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.120]   it was unresponsive.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.200]   The whole system was freezing.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.480]   But good news.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.480]   Good news.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.320]   If you're an insider, there's a fix.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.320]   Hit control.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.320]   I'll delete.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.320]   Choose to open the task manager.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.360]   Go to more details to expand task manager.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:50.920]   Go to file, choose run new task type CMD in the open field, then paste the following into
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.160]   the registry, RegDelete, H.K.C.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:57.880]   use software, Microsoft Windows current version, iris service slash f ampersand ampersand shut
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.960]   down dash r dash t dot zero bingo, Bob's your uncle.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.320]   Everything should be back to normal.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.680]   So simple.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:11.080]   Well, I love first of all, it's a beta.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.080]   This is what happens.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:18.560]   But I love it that Microsoft this got bit by trying to inject an ad into Windows.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:22.880]   And to me, that's the fundamental problem is now I have an operating system that is advertising
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.080]   to me.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.080]   For teams.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.480]   Is that what we have 11?
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.640]   No, I, okay, cynical again.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.760]   This time I'm channeling Tim Cook again.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.960]   The reason Microsoft is doing Windows 11 is because PC sales have started tail off.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:43.400]   And traditionally in the Windows world, people get a new copy of Windows when they buy a
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.400]   new PC.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:49.000]   So really what Microsoft's doing is supporting the PC industry by creating a whole bunch
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.360]   of new PCs this fall that run Windows 11.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.280]   Hoping consumers will say, Oh, I got to have the new version.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.440]   In fact, they made it hard to upgrade to Windows 11.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.120]   I'm saying, but a lot of machines won't eat.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.280]   You can't even run Windows 11.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.280]   Two year old machines.
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.920]   The one I'm using right now is three years old and it's run with 11.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.080]   They wanted that badly.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:14.760]   They say again, by the way, security like consider the children and terrorists is becoming
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.920]   the new mantra for why we want to make more money, how we make more money.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.600]   They say for security reasons, we're not going to let you use a machine without TPU or Intel
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.160]   7th generation earlier than an 8th generation Intel processor.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:28.680]   Not clear that that makes it more secure.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.880]   And I mean, Leo, I take back all the bad things I said.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.600]   I just wanted to show Tim Cook.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.480]   I'm paying out there for the sound break.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.160]   We skewer everybody.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   It's all the same.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.120]   Actually, I want to talk about low cast when we come back.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.360]   I'm going to take a little break right now.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:50.840]   It is said that if you're paying for something, you're the customer, but if you're getting
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.440]   it for free, you're the product.
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.040]   In the case of television channels, you're both the customer and the product.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.040]   Good news.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.920]   We've got the worst of both worlds.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.360]   I'll talk about that in just a little bit with our great panel.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:13.320]   You said when you are protecting yourself in a country where it is not safe to be a
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.960]   dissident, you never touch the internet without a VPN.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.800]   I agree with you, Dan.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:25.480]   If you want to preserve your privacy in the US, you might also want to use a VPN.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.360]   And if you're going to use a VPN, you want to consider which VPN very carefully because
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:34.760]   all of the privacy and security issues are just passed down to that VPN server.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.040]   That's why I use ExpressVPN and recommend it.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.160]   ExpressVPN protects your privacy.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.960]   If they actually go the extra mile with this trusted server technology, the embedded in
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.720]   have deployed on all their servers, when you open, and by the way, it's really nice Express
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.720]   VPN.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.280]   They have an app for every platform, including smart TVs.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.480]   When you press the button, it chooses the server closest to you.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.520]   And at that point, what happens is it's cool.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:01.000]   It spins up in RAM only a copy of the trusted server.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.760]   That's what you're using on their servers.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.760]   It's in RAM.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760]   It's sandbox.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760]   So it cannot write to the hard drive.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.360]   It only operates in RAM.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:13.280]   And as soon as you close that server, it's gone as is every trace of your visit.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.480]   You are completely private.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.440]   So privacy, security, absolutely.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.880]   Every time you connect to an unencrypted network, whether it's at a Starbucks or a
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.640]   hotel or an airport, every person on the network can see you.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.000]   And if it's a bad guy, they can run tools that will allow them to do all sorts of stuff
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   to mess with you.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.600]   It doesn't take much expertise.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.280]   Honestly, a script kitty can do it.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:46.200]   That's why you want to protect yourself online for your privacy and for your security.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.040]   And oh, by the way, when it chooses the server, you can say, I want to be in England instead
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.040]   of in the US.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.280]   I don't want the closest server.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.960]   I want a server in Tokyo.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.680]   And you can use it to watch content that you can't get in the US.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.680]   So there's lots of good reasons.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.680]   ExpressVPN.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.120]   It's kind of like you wouldn't drive without car insurance.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:10.320]   Would you use the internet without the insurance of an encrypted tunnel between your device
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.160]   and the outside world?
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.160]   No.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.560]   ExpressVPN, strong encryption, fire up the app, one button click.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.480]   Yes, it works everywhere, including smart TVs.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.720]   I think they're the probably most invasive technology ever.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.760]   In fact, you can now and this is what we did.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.520]   We could put ExpressVPN on your router.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.760]   So everybody in the house is protected and ExpressVPN.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.920]   Again, this is why you want to choose a good VPN provider.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.480]   They invest in infrastructure so that they're fast so that you can do that.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.640]   You can make all your traffic going on to the internet through go through the VPN and
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.800]   still watch HD video.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.400]   Still nobody will say, oh, what happened?
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.520]   It's all slow because ExpressVPN invests in their infrastructure.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.240]   I recommend and use ExpressVPN.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.760]   I think you should too secure your online data today with the only VPN I trust.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.440]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.520]   Three extra months free when you go there right now.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.360]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360]   Get the one year package.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.280]   You'll get 15 months for the price of 12.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.680]   Expr ESS.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.680]   Spell it out.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.600]   Another reason I like them.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.360]   They leave the vowels in.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.000]   www.ssvpn.com/twit.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.240]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.400]   We thank you for supporting us by, as I always say, using that URL so they know that you
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.520]   saw it here.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.280]   Lowcast has given up and there are a lot of...
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.680]   Do you guys know about lowcast?
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.040]   Yeah, you've heard of it.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.200]   Lowcast was actually kind of like Ariel.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.200]   Remember Ariel?
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.320]   That was the New York City startup that put dime-sized antenna.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.280]   And a giant arrays.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.640]   And then let you, in effect, use that antenna to get local live television stations.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.480]   I was a paying subscriber.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.480]   Were you?
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.480]   Well, of course.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.480]   It was innovative.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:07.040]   The first thing that happened was the networks and broadcast stations sued.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.040]   To their credit, Ariel fought it all the way up to the Supreme Court where they lost.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:18.360]   I actually don't remember why Scoda says Ariel was illegal.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.520]   You can even charge him?
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.040]   Well, no, and that's what happened with lowcast.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040]   Lowcast wasn't charging.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040]   Let me see.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:34.440]   The Supreme Court broadcasters sued Ariel within weeks of its introduction, arguing that streaming
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.560]   their content without permission was copyright infringement.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.960]   That was how they do it.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:48.480]   The Supreme Court heard arguments in April and ruled against Ariel June 2015, I think.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.840]   I can go on and on.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.240]   I don't want to read all this because it's not Jermaine.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:03.800]   What happened was lowcast said, "Okay, how can we do this without falling prey to the
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.640]   same lawsuits?"
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.400]   And they said, "We're going to be a nonprofit."
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.760]   So the copyright rule says, "As long as you don't make money on it, it's okay, right?"
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.760]   I guess.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   No, it doesn't.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.200]   You can copy the right button.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.200]   There's some non-profit rule.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.800]   That's getting a YouTuber or YouTube.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.800]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:22.800]   You're right.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.800]   They're still protected, isn't it?
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.360]   Well, somehow they felt like if we don't make any money, we're protected.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:31.760]   A judge ruled this week that, "Well, that's not the problem.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.000]   The problem is you are a nonprofit, but you take the proceeds.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.200]   So the way lowcast worked, it's free, lowcast.org.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:45.080]   It would only work in the same ADI area of dominant influence of the stations you want
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   to watch.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   So I'm in the Bay Area.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.840]   I get San Francisco stations.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:53.600]   Nobody from Chicago could see those, but people in Chicago would see the Chicago stations.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.880]   And what Ariel was doing was take, and then they put a little announcement saying, "Ariel
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:02.960]   is nonprofit, but support us for five bucks and we won't bother you with these ads asking
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.560]   you to support us."
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.040]   And they did it quite frequently every few minutes.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.440]   And I know a lot of people, a lot of court cutters who said, "This is great.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.400]   Five bucks a month, 60 bucks a year.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.920]   I get the live locals.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.840]   It lets me court cut because I don't need the cable anymore.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.600]   I could just get internet and watch Netflix to Amazon Prime, but I get my live locals
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.440]   so I can watch football, the Academy Awards, that kind of stuff."
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.280]   Local news.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   Local news.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.760]   That's a big thing.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.240]   That's the gap with court cutting.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.480]   Is that live local stuff?
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.520]   If you don't have an antenna or you're not close enough to get violent.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   The TV stations.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.920]   And here's what I understand.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.120]   Anybody can sell an antenna, right?
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.360]   You can go out and buy an antenna that's perfectly legal.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:47.480]   How is locust really any different than an antenna if it essentially gives you the same
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.440]   content that the antenna would?
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:57.440]   Well that's the argument a lot of court cutters use.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:02.160]   Here's why Ariel got shut down and why Locast got shut down as well.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:08.800]   So again, they got sued by the broadcast stations and the judge ruled look because, okay, it's
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.800]   good.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800]   You're nonprofit.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.800]   Good start.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.280]   Except you're taking the proceeds and using it to expand in new markets.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.240]   That's not allowed.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.000]   Locast could of course appeal and they could even do what Ariel did and go all the way
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.080]   to Supreme Court and said they said, "Oh screw it."
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.680]   And they have stopped operating.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:34.600]   So they were really, I think they were designed to get around this thing but the judge said,
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   "No."
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:40.520]   So here's the argument, I think.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.240]   And this goes back to are you a customer or are you a product?
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:50.400]   If you're listening to Twit for instance right now, you could either be both.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.760]   If you're listening and you're hearing the ads, then in effect you're the product.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:58.440]   We make money by selling your ears to the advertisers.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.120]   That's how we survive.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:03.440]   And that's how broadcast television, broadcast radio survive.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:07.200]   If you decide you want to join Club Twit, pay seven bucks a month, we say, "Fine.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.680]   Now you can be the customer.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.200]   You pay us.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.440]   We don't need to put ads in."
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.560]   So we give you the choice.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:20.280]   Broadcast television discovered that they could do both and that's what happened.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.240]   When this goes back to the cable companies and retransmission agreements and the must
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.120]   carry rules.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.560]   So you can see cable companies were created so that you could watch the locals, right?
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560]   I live in Petaluma.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.760]   I'm too far from San Francisco to use an antenna.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.280]   Comcast comes along, put up a big antenna.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.720]   They can get the channels, digs a ditch to my house, puts copper into my house and says,
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.920]   "Here, now you can watch from our antenna, pay us."
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.960]   Broadcast station said, "Well, wait a minute.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.440]   FCC jumps in and says, "All right, you got a choice, broadcasters."
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:57.960]   You can either require that they carry you and then you can't charge them or, and most
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:05.360]   broadcasters chose the second choice, you can say, "We want retransmission fees."
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:12.080]   Comcast, you can broadcast channel four, but you got to give us a fee, buck or less, usually
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.800]   per subscriber, those fees vary.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.960]   And so most stations now are double dipping.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.160]   They get the ad revenue, in fact, they love it because I'm seeing the ads here in Petaluma
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.640]   too, but they also get the revenue from the cable companies.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.720]   You're both a product and the customer.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:34.600]   The problem with Ariel and the problem, in my opinion, with low caste is you're cutting
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.960]   off all these lucrative cable fees.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:48.080]   People no longer need to watch on cable and I think that was why they ultimately sued.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.360]   But you are increasing your audience, which means you could theoretically be getting more
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.360]   advertising revenue.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.440]   Well, guess, I'm going to guess.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   You should ask CBS, but I'm going to guess that they want both.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.720]   What we have CBSN on CBS News.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.720]   You're stringing.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.880]   Yeah, and we don't charge for that.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.960]   It's a free product, so it avoids exactly that.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.480]   We are moving in local markets.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.920]   Sorry, I'm not trying to log roll for CBS or no, no, no, no, no.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.920]   No, no, no.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.000]   You have expertise in this area.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   That's perfect.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.640]   Well, we have CBSN, which is 24 hours a day, streaming news.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.800]   It's hard news because there's no opinions.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:31.960]   We are launching these in different markets like Denver, New York, San Francisco, and
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:35.360]   exactly to your point, Leo, this is not a for-pay product.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:41.880]   This is a local news product, but it is the traditional model where the viewer is the
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.920]   product being sold to advertisers, which I think most of us are familiar with and fairly
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920]   comfortable with.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.080]   I don't work on the business side.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:54.400]   I can't speak for strategic plans, but I know when this was rolled out, this was considered
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.400]   a benefit.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.080]   We're not charging our customers and we're not double dipping here.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.920]   We're not charging the viewers.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.520]   Lowcast has, by the way, appealed to the second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:11.360]   They're not suspending forever, but they are suspended right now.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:18.960]   I did just buy a TV for the first time in my life, and I did get one of those bunny
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.120]   year antennas in the heart of New York, so I had no problem with it.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.840]   I installed it in particular so I could watch CBS.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.640]   Thanks, guys.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   Watch it on Sundays.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.640]   Watch football for free.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.200]   I think that it's kind of interesting that I am able to do that just because I'm in service
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:41.320]   area, but if you're outside of service area, Leo might be and you can't use lowcast.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:47.320]   You know, because you might be costing these companies some money, it seems unfair.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.120]   I wonder if it wasn't for precedent for the fact that then, Tana, have been around for
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.360]   decades if they would try to outlaw what you're doing, you know, given the current situation.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.280]   I mean, that's my point.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:04.680]   I frankly still don't see the difference between your rabbit ears and a locust subscription
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.000]   in terms of what it accounts for.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   I agree 100%.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   I agree 100%.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.920]   And I think, you know, the folks at locust argue, which is greed on the part of the networks,
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.920]   the broadcast stations, they say they get a free license from the US government to use
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:26.120]   those airwaves, but the retransmission consent fees, which are on the order of at least $12
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:33.200]   a month, according to New York Times, to billions of dollars for broadcasters.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.720]   The founder and CEO, David Goodfriend of locusts, says, "Locast was always meant to be a public
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.240]   service for people who want to watch their local broadcast TV stations, can't get them
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.640]   over the air, can't afford expensive cable satellite or streaming services.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.760]   Locast showed that millions of Americans fit that category that he served something better
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.520]   than the status quo.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.400]   Locast says 3.2 million people sign up for the service.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.720]   I don't know how many paid for it, but they did generate $4.3 million in revenue last
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720]   year."
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.960]   That's not nothing.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:13.400]   Well, and that's still all legal, by the way, nonprofits generate revenue all the time.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:19.480]   The judge, Louis L. Stanton of the Southern District of New York, said that the issue
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.680]   is locast was using the proceeds to expand its service to other cities, a move that in
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.440]   his view ran afoul of the law.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.000]   The copyright code, this is weird, but the copyright code allows nonprofits to solicit
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   funds to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the service,
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.080]   but the judge felt that expanding violated that.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:50.000]   The networks called the ruling a victory for copyright law, vindicating our claim that
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.080]   locast is illegally infringing copyrights and broadcast television content and violation
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.160]   of federal law.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.000]   It's a very narrow, it does not vindicate copyright law.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.400]   It's a very narrow slice there.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.800]   I think they would like to put locast out of business.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.560]   I think there are a lot of locast users who are pretty unhappy, and there is no reasonable
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.840]   alternative for a while.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.960]   You could watch locals on sling for $5 a month.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.760]   I was telling people to use that, but it turns out sling was using locast.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.000]   So never mind.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   I don't know.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.840]   What do you think?
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.440]   Who's right in this one?
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.920]   I'll let you recuse yourself in network, guys, if you want to.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.440]   I'm no longer a CBS News employee, so I can say what's on my mind here.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.880]   I contribute, but not employing.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.000]   Look, I'm on locast side.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.960]   I really just think why make it the victim here as the consumer.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.960]   Agreed.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.400]   Is Comcast a victim?
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.400]   Maybe.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400]   But Comcast is the victim.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.800]   The handwriting is on the wall.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.960]   And of course, Comcast and their ilk are making a fortune in internet charges.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.960]   I have the full Comcast double play, right?
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.960]   I've got TV and I've got internet.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.080]   It turns out that the internet is the vast majority of what my monthly payments are.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:11.960]   So even if I stopped paying that little cable bump that they get, they would still be getting
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.560]   over $100 a month for me for my high-speed internet.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.840]   So I just think that enough is enough.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.440]   And to make it harder for people to get stuff that they could get, if they had a big enough
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.160]   antenna, Leo, I'm sure there's probably some technology.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:31.760]   Oh, if I had 100 foot masks, I could probably get the locals.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.200]   Although if I go to TV Fool, it says, no, you're not going to get anything but channel 50,
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.200]   which is up in Santa Rosa.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:43.040]   Well, but the point is, why should you not get broadcast TV just because you happen to
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.000]   be a few miles away from marketing?
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.840]   But that's what created the cable business.
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.000]   That's really what started cable, right?
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   Too bad.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   They can make their money on the internet.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.600]   They make plenty of it on the internet.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.600]   They figure this out.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:57.080]   I'm going to be a podcast that connects safely supporters, so maybe I'm in trouble in another
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080]   regard.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.080]   No, they're not.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.080]   We didn't hear that.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.080]   What?
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.080]   No.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.080]   Dan, do you want to say anything?
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.080]   Do you?
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.080]   I mean, I understand.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.880]   I mean, broadcasters want to keep making those sweet cable dollars.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.880]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.880]   I don't blame them.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.160]   And there's definitely nobody at my work telling me what to say.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160]   No, I know.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160]   I'm just teasing.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.160]   Obviously.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.160]   I mean, oh, for sure.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.160]   I know.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.160]   But some people might not know that.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.160]   Yes.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:27.440]   I mean, look, when I was in an area or an arrow subscriber, I felt like at least what
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.880]   was told to me was that this is a physical array.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.120]   This is an actual transmitter.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.440]   And you are renting time on it, or you're paying for that physical time.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.240]   And look, I lived in Brooklyn.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.240]   I live in Brooklyn.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.880]   I've lived in New York for a long time.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.640]   And sometimes you just cannot get a transmission signal in the middle of buildings.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.600]   So it felt like, OK, I'm not ripping anyone off.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.600]   And at the time, I worked for a different news network.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.720]   I did not feel as though.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:01.120]   And I think the same about low-cast, but I don't know the fundamentals of their business model.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120]   Here, I found it.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.120]   I found it.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.280]   This is in US Code Section 111 of the copyright code.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:12.680]   It specifically talks about retransmission of broadcasts.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.280]   Secondary retransmissions are exempt from copyright.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:23.440]   If it's not made by a cable system, it consists entirely of the relaying, oh, this is why they
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.440]   did it, but the management of a hotel apartment house, that's why they did it so that you
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:33.200]   could have an antenna for a hotel and all watch that.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.280]   Or similar establishment of signals transmitted by a broadcast station licensed by the FCC
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.920]   within the local service area of such station.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.760]   And as long as you don't make money at it.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.540]   So this is an exemption that was carved out, I think probably not for companies like low-cast
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:56.200]   and ARIO, but for others.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:01.000]   It's not actionable if the primary transmission is maybe the carriage signal.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.720]   So the key is you can't make money at it.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.400]   But the hotel is making money off the room.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.880]   Boy, I'm not a lawyer.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.400]   So I'm going to have to defer to a lawyer on this one.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400]   Clearly.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:23.160]   Your low-cast was trying to use this section of the law to justify it.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.720]   And I wonder if this judge I think is mistaken.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.440]   I think they might win on appeal.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:34.000]   You know, how much damage does it actually do to the networks if something like low-cast
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.800]   is widely available?
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.900]   Because it will require people, you know, you're not going to really get a lot of people
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:42.800]   signing up to low-cast if they can use the antenna.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.120]   Like someone were in a location like me.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.920]   Yours is not going to get a lot of people signing up to low-cast if they have a cable
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.920]   subscription, someone like Leo.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.920]   So what is the total addressable market for a service like this?
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.920]   I have to think that it's the cable companies that really wanted the broadcast companies
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.920]   to sue.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.920]   They don't have standing.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.920]   So they haven't.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.560]   I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, they're nudging them.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.800]   Brian Rogers called up and said, you know, Brian Roberts called up and said, could you
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.160]   sue these guys?
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:14.080]   So Leo, the only thing stopping Leo from getting rid of my cable subscription is I want those
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   locals and I can't get them any other way.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:21.800]   If I have low-cast and I add low-cast maybe to Netflix and Amazon Prime, all I need is
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   an internet connection.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.800]   I don't need the cable TV.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   Right?
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.000]   So that's who's really at risk from this.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.840]   And remember that it does, the money does go downhill because the broadcasters get that
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.840]   money from companies.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.640]   The ones flying the ointment though from the standpoint of the networks, what if we were
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:43.360]   to go and buy the Express VPN product you were talking about earlier and tunnel ourselves
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.000]   into a market that we don't actually live in?
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   The way I get to watch BBC, by the way, against all British law by using a VPN.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   You are free London.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.920]   No, but I'm serious.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.600]   You could one get a look.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.880]   If one gets still existed and I wanted to watch New York television, could I use a VPN
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.880]   to tunnel into New York?
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:06.840]   Well, just like the BBC and I player, they attempt to discover if you're using a VPN
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.800]   and block you.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:17.920]   The issue is that many VPNs are doing things to get around that like changing IP addresses
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.720]   regularly using a clean pool and stuff like that.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.840]   So I think it's not easy to know if you're coming in on a VPN, but they try.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.920]   And I bet you if lowcast did a good faith effort, which I think they do to block VPN
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:33.160]   traffic, that would be considered sufficient.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.240]   You can't block everyone.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:44.280]   But in theory, you're only watching if you're in local.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:50.760]   This is an example of, you know, I'm on the side of users and enthusiasts.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.000]   So I'm saying, damn you.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.200]   But at the same time, I kind of understand that this is really a game that lowcast is
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:03.600]   playing, that they looked at area and said, how can we get around that?
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.760]   And they're making money on it.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.040]   I'm sure they're making money on it.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.960]   I mean, they're a nonprofit, but they pay their staff.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:17.160]   Actually on Reddit, there was outrage because good friend makes $180,000 a year to which
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.480]   people said, are you kidding?
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.040]   Do you know how much the head of the Red Cross makes?
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040]   This is nothing.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.400]   The sky's not breaking it in.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.120]   That's actually quite reasonable for the head of a nonprofit.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.240]   Well, I don't know.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:36.040]   So on the one hand, I know all of our listeners, a lot of them use lowcast.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.840]   I've recommended lowcast over the years.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.840]   It does seem like it's just, I don't know, really what's happening is we're in a transitional
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:47.680]   period where broadcast is going to be replaced by streaming, right?
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.240]   Ultimately, isn't it?
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.800]   That's why we have CBSN.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.800]   CBS isn't dumb.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:57.480]   They know that's the future and they maybe it's a loss leader right now, but ultimately
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.480]   they need to understand this business.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.600]   And it's why the cable companies have internet access.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:05.120]   I don't know if there's any major cable company that doesn't, isn't the internet provider
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.400]   in their market or one of the internet providers in their market.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.520]   So it is a transition.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.520]   You're absolutely right.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.000]   And I don't think any of these companies are going to go out of business.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.680]   I mean, CBS makes money or should make money because they got great content.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.040]   I mean, that's the reason why it's--
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.640]   Are there ads on CBS on the CBS streaming and CBSN?
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.480]   It's exactly like you.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:29.520]   It's indistinguishable from watching a television news product.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.520]   We have ads.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:31.600]   You can't fast forward.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.400]   You can't fast forward in your V on your DVR.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   That's the only downside.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400]   That's true.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.400]   Well, it's live.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   Right.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.400]   And I'm sure that factored you to the--
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400]   You can't fast.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.400]   Let's call it--
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.400]   Let's call it nature.
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.400]   You can't watch literally live management.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.480]   You can't go to the end of this show until we do it.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:49.200]   But you can record broadcast news and watch it later.
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.200]   I can watch--
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.200]   Oh, I'm sure there's way to record CBSN for sure.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.200]   Oh, you don't need to.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.160]   I mean, we put all of our segments online and you can just rewind.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.600]   I mean, you can scrub backwards.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.040]   The same thing you do with any live product is a player.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.040]   You can just--
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.360]   So, especially if you want to hear a point that was made a couple times.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.080]   And it's not just on your browser.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:12.000]   You know, we're on your Roku and, I mean, all the OTT boxes.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.320]   Do they prevent you from jumping through commercials?
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.160]   Do they do anything about it like that?
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.160]   Do you know?
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.160]   It's live, so you can't.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.800]   No, but if you're watching the recorded stuff--
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:22.800]   Oh.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.960]   You know, I've never tried.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.000]   I mean, if I'm watching a segment, it's on the website.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000]   We're on YouTube.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   It's YouTube ads.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.120]   And if I'm on the website, like, I can't skip the ads.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.880]   And I have ad blockers running like crazy on some browsers.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.480]   And I can't skip the ads.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   Which is fair.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.480]   You know, it's my salary.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.480]   That's fairs, though.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.480]   No, that's completely fair.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.480]   Right.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   Right.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480]   It does feel fair.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.880]   And that's-- I mean, that's what-- like, it really does-- again, I'm really sorry.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.320]   I'm not trying to log roll for CBS.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.320]   No, no, no.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.160]   It does feel like a fair proposition.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.160]   Here's the challenge.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.040]   If you give you news, we put ads in it.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.040]   And that's it.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.040]   You can watch or not watch.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.040]   Right.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040]   Here's the challenge.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040]   Nothing shady.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.040]   Here's the challenge.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.040]   And this is the same challenge radio stations face.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.040]   There's several.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.800]   First of all, broadcasting as a different business model.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.880]   When you're broadcasting, a million people could watch.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.360]   It doesn't cost you any more than one person watching.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.440]   When you're streaming, it's completely the opposite.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440]   It flips it.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.760]   Every single person who watches costs you--
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.040]   Not a lot, but costs you some money.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.720]   Those costs are going down.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.920]   The other problem is now you have to sell advertisers.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:34.240]   So when I'm a local station, I'm selling ads for the local businesses.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:40.520]   Does CBS can only sell national ads, or are they doing some sort of IP address geolocation
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.520]   stuff?
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.520]   Do they have different ads?
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.520]   Do you know?
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.520]   You probably--
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.960]   Well, I'm-- again, I'm not on the business side, but I do know that our ads on CBSN are
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   national.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.600]   I'm sure there's geolocation stuff.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.360]   But we are rolling out to local markets, and I know that the editorial priority was that
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.400]   we believe in local news.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.400]   And the reason--
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.400]   So in those cases, you're going to get local ads.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.880]   You're going to get local ads.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.600]   You'll probably get national ads, too, but I'm sure if you're in Denver, you'll get a
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600]   local ad.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.600]   So you'll get local--
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.600]   But that's more--
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.600]   But you'll get local anchors that you know.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.600]   Ads work.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:17.160]   The only thing that gripes me at all is when you charge for something and you run ads.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.160]   Yeah, I know.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.160]   Exactly.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.160]   Exactly.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.160]   That's everybody.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.160]   I mean, that's what--
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.160]   Well, cable.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160]   I mean, it does.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160]   People run ads.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.160]   And I'm paying a lot of money to watch that.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.840]   Oh, you know, we have Paramount Plus, so I can't say we're not doing this.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.800]   But I don't think those products were developed separately.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.800]   So I can't say we're not doing that.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.800]   Well, everybody does it.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.600]   And I have to pay for a higher tier of peacock and hulu.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.600]   Right, hulu.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.280]   So I don't get ads.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.800]   But you know, so I like how we're doing it a twit.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.520]   You either get ads or you pay a seven bucks a month and you don't get ads.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.040]   You don't pay seven bucks a month and get ads.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.240]   That's double dipping.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.640]   But everybody double dips now.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.920]   So I guess I can't complain.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.920]   But I--
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.720]   Peacock do you give you-- isn't peacock free plus ads the option I am?
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:03.720]   Yes.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.640]   So there's a free ad supportive version.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.240]   There's a little bit-- pay a little bit more.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.240]   You still get ads.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.840]   But you get more content.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.160]   And then there's the peacock premium, which I ended up buying because I don't want ads
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.240]   and I want all the content.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.680]   And that's probably their point is we give them-- it's freemium.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.640]   You know, we give it away, but you're going to end up wanting to pay for it.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.640]   Same thing for Paramount Plus.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.640]   Same thing for--
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.200]   We kind of like that model, actually.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.200]   The freemium--
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.200]   If you give a you their choice.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.200]   Give a choice.
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.480]   The reason I like ad supported free is it's democratic.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.960]   There's anybody who's got internet can watch us.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.200]   I think that's the right way to be.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.280]   I think you want to be everywhere you can be.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.920]   And I don't think you want to have people to have to pay.
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.840]   But I understand some people don't want to be tracked.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.520]   All ads in some way are going to end up tracking you because advertisers demand it now.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.240]   And people don't want to see ads so fine.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.680]   Seven bucks a month.
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.000]   That doesn't exactly-- I don't know what the exact replacement would be.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.840]   I don't know how much we make per advertising listener.
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.440]   It's probably more than seven bucks a month.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.680]   But it's enough so that we can say, OK, no ads.
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.880]   I guess the ideal way would be for us to figure out how much per listener we get and
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.920]   then make that be the fee to get rid of the ads.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.480]   But I don't think we're that sophisticated.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.080]   Hulu apparently thinks it's 11 bucks a month.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.320]   But they got more stuff.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.320]   They're below deck.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.600]   Wouldn't you rather watch below deck than listen to it?
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.080]   I think so.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.240]   There's a club to it going, Leo.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.800]   Pretty good.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.280]   You know, we didn't know what the expectations would be.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:43.760]   You know, Lisa, my wife, our CEO, and the only person who understands business in this
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:53.120]   company was hoping that we could get a 10% subscribe rate, which would be phenomenal.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.960]   That would absolutely be enough to just eliminate advertising.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.240]   I was a little less sanguine because we'd already tried this at the very beginning of
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.240]   Twitch.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:06.080]   You know, in the PBS world, with constant pledge drives and everything, I think they
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.960]   get 5% or 6%.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.520]   So I was hoping that we would maybe get 10% of our audience.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.000]   With PBS, you have the truth.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.400]   Other than making you feel good, it doesn't give you any benefit.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.600]   It doesn't give you any benefit.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.600]   So we're giving you a benefit.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.360]   And it's, by the way, it's not just ad free.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.680]   There's, I think, our Discord is fun and we get the Twitch+ feed and all that.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:36.000]   But I don't think we have more than about 3,500 subscribers, which is 2% of the audience.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.880]   Oh, let me backtrack what I just said, because I just subscribed to KQED, which is the PBS
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.480]   station in San Francisco.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.160]   And I do get the PBS app on my Roku.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.080]   So actually, I think you can get that for free, can't you?
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.320]   I don't know.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.080]   I think some PBS content you have to pay for.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.080]   Okay.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.320]   So that's another mess because the government funds it.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.160]   They have corporate funders, contributes.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.160]   They don't fund it 100%.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.760]   They have corporate funders.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.920]   No, I, that's one of those where, yeah, I give money to feel good.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.720]   And I want a tote bag, right?
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.960]   Who doesn't want a tote bag?
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:17.440]   No, I just, I feel like I want to support a company that's doing good things for the
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.440]   community.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.840]   That's a good, you know, it's a charitable donation in effect.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:21.840]   In effect, it is.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.840]   It literally is.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.600]   Well, actually, I don't know if you could write a law for that, but I think you can.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.600]   I think you can.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.320]   We are not giving you anything of value because you, you would get the value anyway.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.640]   We are not a nonprofit.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.360]   You cannot write off your $7.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:37.040]   Well, maybe from business, you fish.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.040]   I don't know.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.760]   I would love to see it be more than 2%.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.680]   That seems a little low.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:47.040]   One in one in 50 listeners to our shows are willing to give us money, but honestly, we've
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.240]   been giving it away for 15, 16 years.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:54.560]   So I can, it's also hard to start charging for something to be given away for 15 years.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.880]   You know what your problem is Leo, your advertising, your ad are too interesting.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.040]   A number of people.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.040]   You're not annoying people.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.840]   A number of people told me I pay.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:05.840]   In fact, somebody just said this in chat, I pay, but I still listen to the ads.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.040]   Take the, you know, take some my pillow ads and you'll be sure people.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.080]   We got to, we got to make our ads more obnoxious.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.080]   I think you're right.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.720]   That's how we get, that's how we get the subscribers up.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.280]   I hadn't thought of that.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.240]   How can we make our ads worse?
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.240]   Yeah, really.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.720]   No, I'm, I don't know.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:31.560]   I kind of, as I get older, have less of a dog in this hunt.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:35.960]   I can now start to sit back and say, I wonder how this is all going to play out.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:41.800]   It's very clear that everything's going to come in on the internet eventually, right?
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   Right.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800]   Right.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.800]   Yes.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.720]   No, the metaverse, of course, the metaverse.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:47.720]   Yeah, the metaverse.
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.360]   I mean, I work in radio.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.280]   I, you know, I get a significant portion of my income comes from a weekly radio show,
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:57.840]   the tech guy show.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.200]   But I don't think that's a longer proposition.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.880]   I don't know.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:02.880]   What do you think?
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.120]   You do, Larry, you do radio.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.720]   You know, we had this conversation.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:11.920]   I remember when I was at around, I don't know, 2012 and I was, the CBS people were
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:15.720]   feeling fat and happy because they were, you know, they had no threat because they
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.160]   own these transmitters, right?
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:22.160]   And I said to them, I said, you know, what's going to happen is that eventually you're
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:26.720]   going to be able to listen to streaming radio in the car on the iPhone or the Android.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:27.800]   And of course, that came about.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:30.160]   I can't remember exactly what year they came about.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.480]   But it's taken, but we, you're still at the point, if you want to listen to local traffic
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:38.060]   and you're driving, you know, through Silicon Valley, you're probably going to turn case
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.400]   CBS on on your FM radio.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.720]   But you don't have to.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:42.960]   There are alternatives.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:47.440]   And that's where I think broadcast is eventually going to have to change their business model.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.440]   Is it traffic?
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:52.760]   Is that the only thing keeping the traffic and weather and listening to me?
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.760]   Maybe I don't like it.
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.040]   I think you can get weather.
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:58.400]   I don't think you know, I think weather is the first thing that should go.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.720]   I have weather on the front page of my phone.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.000]   Well, first of all, I got that in the car.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   Who cares what the weather needs?
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.600]   The traffic report you have.
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.600]   Oh, that's true.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:08.600]   I got ways I got games.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.600]   That's a good point.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.600]   That's much.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.500]   It feels like 10 times better than some guy in the sky doing a bit of traffic over there
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.200]   where I'm not even going.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.200]   Right.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:21.040]   My clear started in radio and I remember my boss.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.360]   I think this is still true.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:25.760]   And it's the problem that you're describing that radio still solves.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:33.760]   And my boss told me that, look, our value proposition is one button.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.480]   You turn your car on and we are playing.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.480]   Right.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:40.360]   And when you're driving, although we have all of this technology, which will provide
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:45.640]   us with news and music and weather and all this information, even with my phone, I mean,
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:46.640]   that's a ridiculous proposition.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.480]   You use my phone while I'm driving.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:53.520]   What I can do with the radio is punch a button and change the transmitter or change the station.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.520]   Except for my Tesla.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.440]   The thing is that has even changed.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:00.360]   I even said that in the early days of podcasting until where as easy as punching a button
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.800]   on a radio will never be as big as radio.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.280]   But that has all changed with car play and Android audio or on your Tesla Android.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.280]   True.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:09.600]   It's easier.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.360]   I get in the car and whatever I was listening to starts again.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:17.640]   And if I wanted to get a traffic report for some reason, I could fire.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:21.320]   I assume your Mustang has what the Tesla has, right?
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:25.920]   Which of the ability to verbally ask for any audio source you want.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:32.800]   It's actually better because Tesla insists on using its own software.
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:33.800]   Right.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:38.560]   Most cars these days, including my Mustang, Mach-E use Android Auto or car play.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:42.080]   That's better than anything because I've got Siri or Google's voice.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:49.440]   I've got all my apps and plus my phone is updated daily compared to a car which is updated
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.120]   maybe once a year at best.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.440]   Except for Tesla, which is updated all the time.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.720]   But the truth is the last time you were not the sample of all drivers.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.480]   No, but that's kids on the road.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:00.480]   I love what you're saying.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.120]   I think that's a future that exists for you.
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.120]   One year thing.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.120]   Exactly.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.360]   It's the present to you.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.200]   It is the future for a lot more people.
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:14.360]   I wonder how many people have every modern automobile now has a car player in dude audio,
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.360]   I think.
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.360]   Except for the Tesla.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.360]   Or something.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:22.600]   What's the average length of time that a car spends a year of time of a car?
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:23.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:24.600]   Yeah, I wonder.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.600]   I'm not trying to be argumentative.
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:26.600]   No, no, no, no.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:30.600]   I'm just saying a lot of people just get in the car and the radio is the radio.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.600]   No, that's right.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.480]   But if I wave, you have to plan for the future.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:40.080]   You can't say, "Oh, I'm fat and happy now," as many radio executives do.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.440]   What's it going to be like in five years or ten years?
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.600]   Are you going to still have a business?
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:45.600]   I don't know.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.600]   I think I'm missing the key here though.
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.400]   I think that the station manager got something wrong, power to him.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.640]   But it's not about convenience to listen to local radio.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.240]   It's the fact that local radio brings you together with the people that you're living
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.240]   about.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.040]   And you feel like you're part of some.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.040]   It's live.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.040]   It's live.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.040]   Yep.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.040]   And yourself.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:06.040]   I know those DJs, those anchors.
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.040]   Exactly.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.440]   I just moved back to New York, which is where I grew up from California.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.440]   Periscential relations.
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:16.120]   I gotta say, I get a thrill turning on these radio stations as opposed to playing from
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.800]   Bluetooth, because I remember that I'm part of this.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.920]   And I can, you know, when they read the weather, it's not just me checking my weather app.
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.880]   That's all of us together learning what it's going to be.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.880]   When they tell us traffic, that's all of us sitting on those roads learning what it's
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:28.880]   going to be.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:29.880]   I think that's the conversation.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.240]   And algorithms have pushed us into silos.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:34.240]   Exactly.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.040]   And when I hear the sports guys talking about like how the jets or the mets or the nicks
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.760]   are doing, I'm like, dang, these people are connecting me with thousands of other people
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760]   who feel the same way I am.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.320]   In the middle and I are turning on now.
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.840]   And it's one of the few shared experiences we still have.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.840]   God bless you.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.400]   Alex, can't do it.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   God bless you.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:55.680]   You and I have to say that because you and I grew up with Walter Cronkite, Huntley, Brinkley,
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.680]   and whoever the ABC.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.080]   And Don, I'm a son.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.080]   And that was it, right?
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:00.080]   That was it.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.160]   66 W and B.C.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.000]   And I love that.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000]   And you're right.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.240]   Alex is exactly right.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:09.560]   There was a communality.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:14.560]   But as you're about to point out, I don't want to hear thunder, Larry, that's disappearing.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.960]   Well, no, it's true.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:22.440]   I mean, when I look back at the golden days of TV in the 60s and 70s, I like the fact
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:27.000]   that virtually every American who was watching TV or was watching one of three networks.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.200]   And if they were listening to radio, they were watching listening to one of three or
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:33.480]   four local news stations.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:38.840]   And I really think that this whole misinformation situation we're in is partially as a result
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.280]   of the fact that we have so many choices at any boho now can either get on the internet
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.560]   or get on cable news, partially, say whatever they want.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:52.440]   Now I love the fact that we have choices, but I'd be mowing the book.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.920]   We have out of ten of consequences.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.080]   So what was the term you use, Dan, para community?
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:58.080]   Is that what you call it?
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.080]   Para social relationships.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.160]   I mean, we have them now with podcasts.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:07.840]   It's when you have a relationship with somebody who doesn't have a relationship with you.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.360]   So a broadcaster or a podcast host, a Twitch streamer, a parasocial relationship.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.800]   It's a one-sided, one-sided asynchronous.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.800]   Okay.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.160]   So what is it's so what do they what do psychologists say about that?
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:25.720]   I've experienced that because people will come here or I'll meet people in the street
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.160]   who know me, but I've never met them in my life.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.080]   Because they've spent hundreds or thousands of hours with you.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.240]   You are their friend.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.520]   But or they, yeah, you are their friend, but they are not your friends.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.520]   So what is that?
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.520]   By the way, how you treat them, they will never forget it.
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:43.520]   Oh, I know.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.520]   I know.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.880]   I've never, never, never rude if I can help it.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:46.880]   I've never rude.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.680]   And there's a relationship between the listeners and the broadcaster, but also the listeners
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.760]   and each other.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:58.200]   So there becomes these communities of Twitch listeners or communities of, for instance,
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:02.600]   Joe Rogan listeners and they feel a bond that when they meet somebody else who listens,
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.600]   this is true.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.080]   They're part of that community.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.240]   That's true.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.160]   You know, Willard Scott passed away this week.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.920]   Oh, yeah, I know.
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:11.920]   87.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.280]   He was the today show weatherman.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:20.920]   That's a perfect example of somebody of a parasocial relationship because everybody felt
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.920]   like they knew this guy.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.440]   That was his secret, wasn't it?
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:24.440]   Was it?
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.360]   It was very like you knew like he was your buddy.
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.120]   He wasn't standoffish.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.120]   All of these broadcasters.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.120]   That's a good broadcast.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.120]   Broadcasters.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:36.960]   This is a good, I mean, yeah, a good broadcaster is one you feel as though you have a personal
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.520]   relationship with not one you feel like is broadcasting to millions of people.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:43.600]   You know, I had the same experience with Leo.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.600]   I meet people.
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:47.320]   Like what happens with me is nobody recognizes what I look like.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.320]   But they know your voice.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.320]   My voice.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:54.360]   So I'll be in a restaurant or a radio and somebody say, you got guy and you know, there's a bond.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:56.360]   Wow.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.360]   Very interesting.
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.800]   It just happened to me also where I walked into one of my new local coffee shops and the
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:06.040]   guy looked at me goes, you got a podcast?
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.040]   Wow.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.520]   He had seen a video about it on YouTube recently.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.120]   It's a big field of research.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   Yeah, it was cool.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.120]   I was like, wow.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.800]   But you know, I see the numbers, but I didn't realize there's actually people behind them.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.920]   But you know, I never believed that actually people there.
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.160]   It's amazing when you when you find that and you have that one of them.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.760]   So actually, that's a great point.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:33.880]   I wonder if that's going to keep some sort of, does it have to be live?
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.200]   No, you don't have a, you're not listening to Joe Rogan live.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200]   Right.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.000]   I mean, a lot of people are.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.480]   Oh, really?
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.480]   You can listen live.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:46.920]   I mean, we do our stuff live, but it's a, I would say and twitches, Twitch is asynchronous
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:47.920]   and it's live.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:48.920]   Right.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.920]   You too.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.920]   A lot of people watch in live.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920]   Actually, that's a good point.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.400]   A lot of people watch Twitch live.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:55.400]   Do we want live?
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.200]   Is that what we want?
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.320]   I don't think live is the issue except for sports and certain breaking news.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.360]   I think it's, I think it's something else.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:08.360]   I think it's the fact that we have such a, a balkanization of providers.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.360]   That's the problem.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.360]   And again, and again, I'm not bemoaning that because it's also the benefit.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:15.560]   We wouldn't have a Twitter or, or, you know, the big tech podcast.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:19.760]   If it weren't for the fact that anybody can get into this business without investing
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.360]   billions of dollars in transmit.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.920]   So that's the good part.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:23.920]   The bad part is.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.520]   You invested millions of dollars.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.240]   So you didn't need to invest millions simply to get on the air.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:37.560]   Well, what's funny is when I started in 2005 to do what we wanted to do did cost a lot
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.720]   of money.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:46.000]   Now you got people like Alex Cooper who just got bought by Spotify for $60 million who
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.000]   basically uses her phone in bed.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.640]   And so the technology is also moving in the direction of enabling.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.880]   But one of the side effects is now there's a lot more people doing it and there's a lot
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.480]   more competition.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:01.480]   Right.
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.880]   You know, and there are a lot more.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:06.760]   Maybe this is the largest societal effect.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.560]   Nishes, narrow.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:14.920]   So, so there's a Joe Rogan listener who doesn't talk to the Alex Cooper listener.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.400]   They're different Spotify.
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:17.400]   Mine on both of them.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:20.960]   In fact, probably that's why Spotify owns both of them because there's an impermanent
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:23.440]   permeable barrier between them.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.640]   And algorithms are amplifying this.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.200]   And they're amplifying it.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.200]   Right.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.200]   Yes.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:30.200]   Is that good or bad?
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:35.000]   Is that part of the problem in this country is that we've got all these little bubbles
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.080]   that we live in and we don't talk to one?
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:44.360]   I had this long conversation a couple of weeks ago with Maria, Ressa, Roger McMe and Chris
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.360]   Wiley.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.360]   It was an interesting mix of people.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:52.520]   Ressa runs Rappler in the Philippines, one of the largest news organizations in her region.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:56.640]   She's also been the subject to target of attacks by Duterte.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:59.880]   Roger McMe was an early investor in Facebook and an author.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:03.600]   He's also a college classmate, I might add.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.840]   Oh, interesting.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.080]   And Chris Wiley was this Cambridge Analytical whistleblower.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:12.640]   And all of them said, I asked them, are there good things that come from this?
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:17.400]   And they all said, look, community can come from this, kind of like what Alex and Larry
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.840]   and you are describing.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:23.080]   But they said the harm greatly outweighs it because we're actually not creating communities,
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.680]   we're creating silos and they don't talk to each other.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.080]   And when those silos only talk to each other, they create challenges.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:31.640]   Some of those are not so bad.
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:32.960]   Some of those are really bad.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:37.800]   But no matter what, when you have information ghettos and silos, it's not a good thing.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.720]   What you guys are describing are communities broadcasting.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.400]   And many people with shared values.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.320]   What social media algorithms do is the opposite of this.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.040]   At least that was their argument.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:52.360]   So I'm a member of the next store, nextdoor.com in Palo Alto.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:57.040]   And we're having a vibrant debate over this recall, this attempt to recall Governor News
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.600]   them and replace him with Larry Elder, a right-wing talk show host.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:03.800]   And I've been very vocal because I really think the recall is horrible.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:08.760]   But the point is that there actually is a conversation going on between a handful of
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.520]   people who really are pro recall and a group of people who are anti recall.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.000]   And it's refreshing.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.840]   And I don't get that on Facebook because Facebook, everybody, I know agrees with me.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.840]   They're all like-minded people.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:20.000]   And it's kind of boring.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.440]   Is it a shouting match on next door?
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.800]   We ought to shout him out.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.800]   It's pretty respectful.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.800]   I mean, these are actually--
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.800]   It's really interesting.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.800]   I'm going to be careful.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.680]   Is your progress being made as one side persuading the other?
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:32.960]   Well, that's what I was about to say.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:33.960]   That's the problem is no.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.080]   They're talking at each other.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:41.520]   If you are a pro recall guy, you are convinced that Gavin Newsom is a devil incarnate.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:46.520]   And if you're an anti-pre-recall person, you're worried about a Republican takeover
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.400]   based on 10% of the vote after they recall the guy.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.120]   So no, that's the problem.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.720]   There's still no movement.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.720]   Shoot.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.760]   And I thought we'd solved the problem.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:59.440]   Or I should say it doesn't appear to be movement.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.720]   But at least through the conversation, it's disrespectful.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:06.120]   It's a big step to just even have a conversation.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.880]   I think I want to vote for life.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:14.920]   I think that there is something in the human biology that likes knowing that the person
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:19.920]   you're watching right now is doing what they're doing, whether it's next to you or not right
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920]   now.
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.360]   That when you're driving--
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:26.240]   Somebody in the chair said, you're driving down the deacon.
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:29.200]   And you're listening to the same thing the guy in the car next to you is listening to.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:30.400]   There's something happening there.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.680]   There's something magical happening there.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:35.600]   I kind of hope that succeeds.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.600]   We're nuts.
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.520]   No podcast network does what we do.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.960]   Streams are shows live.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.720]   I mean, some do, but it's very expensive.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.360]   And it's not a probably-- it's easier now with Twitch and YouTube and stuff.
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.320]   But it was a crazy idea.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.760]   But I loved live because I came from radio.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.240]   And I just love the idea.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.440]   And talk radio is a two-way street.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:58.440]   It's not parasocial.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:04.040]   Well, it is, but it's less so because you're talking to the person who's listening to you
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.400]   at the same time.
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:06.400]   I like that.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.400]   I love talk radio.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.600]   I just don't want it to go away.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:13.800]   And I feel like probably the internet's probably going to get rid of it.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.800]   But the internet-- well, the internet is just simply a mechanism of delivery.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.800]   It's a delivery mechanism.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.720]   It has absolutely nothing to do with the content itself.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:22.720]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.320]   You can be listening through radio, television, to cans with a string.
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:28.320]   It's just a connect switch.
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.200]   A bit of the internet is-- yeah.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.800]   Twitch has amazing chat rooms, right?
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:35.240]   I mean, you can watch Twitch later, but it's way better live.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.240]   You have a chat room.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:38.240]   They're arguing.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.440]   They're talking about crazy things that the broadcast is talking about.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.480]   Yeah, no, it's true.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:47.520]   All right, well, we got to-- as they used to say in radio, "Pace and Bills."
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:50.040]   We're going to take a little break.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:54.800]   My dear friends, Larry Maggot is here of connectsafely.org.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:55.800]   Are you the CEO?
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:56.800]   Is that your--
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.800]   I am the CEO.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.800]   Wow.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.800]   How long does that tell you how few people work for me?
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.800]   Oh, OK.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:02.800]   OK.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:05.160]   You're the CEO of connectsafely.org.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:06.560]   Larry Maggot on the Twitter.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.560]   Great to have you.
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.320]   Of course, Dan Patterson from CBS News.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   CBSN.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320]   Is it CBSN.com?
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:15.280]   No, it's just CBS News.com/live.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.280]   Nice.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.280]   CBSNews.com/live.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:24.480]   And there are apps for every platform, and I put it on my Apple TV because it's nice to
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:26.280]   have live news.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.280]   It's--
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.280]   It doesn't require cable.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.280]   I think it's great.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:30.280]   Who's that?
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:31.280]   What's his name?
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.280]   We've been hearing him.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.280]   Why is he red?
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:34.280]   Hi.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.280]   Fred.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280]   Sorry, he's--
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:37.280]   I know, he hears me and then he is--
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:38.280]   I don't mind.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:39.280]   Let's fret.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:40.280]   Where's Fred?
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.280]   He's red on a lag.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.280]   What is Fred?
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280]   I see a tail.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   Let's all see.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.280]   A red tail.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.280]   It's in a lab.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.280]   Come on.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.280]   Come on.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.280]   Leap into Daddy's lap.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.280]   Oh, look at him.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.280]   Hi.
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.280]   What a good boy.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.280]   Welcome to Fred.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:55.280]   Oh.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.280]   Sorry.
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:57.280]   Sorry.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:58.280]   No, he's adorable.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.280]   I want to take him home.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.280]   He's great.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.280]   He's just under patches.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.280]   Aw.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.280]   Look at that good boy.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:08.280]   And he's a gag after member because I mean you might have to pay him.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:10.280]   Yeah, I have to pay him scale.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.280]   Also, what scale for dog appearance on podcast?
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:16.280]   Probably more than your pay me, Leo.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.280]   Yeah, probably more.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.280]   Also with us, it's great to have Alex Cantrowitz.
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:22.280]   Bigtechnology.substack.com.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:24.280]   And of course, the podcast is there as well.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.280]   Is he a rich back?
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:31.280]   Somebody says, Mr. Bean thinks that the good boy is a, not you, Alex.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.280]   You're not a Rhodesian.
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.280]   I was about to say this is a pure mutt.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.280]   He's a mutt.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:36.280]   I like the mutts.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:38.280]   He's a good boy though.
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:47.800]   You know, if you have a dog or you have wildfires or as in Petaluma, you have a season where
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:52.280]   people are fertilizing, you might wish you had a molecule.
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:58.280]   We got a molecule, I have to say.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:02.280]   And we know when it's not working, we have to remember sometimes people turn it off or
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:05.280]   whatever and, at least he'll wake up and say the molecule was off last night.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:07.280]   I said, yes, it was.
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.280]   She's not going to headache.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.280]   Molecule, that was the first one we got.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.280]   We liked it so much.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.280]   We got one for Michael's bedroom.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:15.280]   Now we have one in the studio.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.280]   Molecules re-imagining the future of clear air starting with the air purifier.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:25.280]   Now the thing to understand about the molecule, a lot of people don't understand.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.280]   It's not a filter.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.280]   It's not something trapping particles for later disposal.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.280]   Molecules core technology, it's called Pico, P-E-C-O.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.280]   It's short for photoelectrochemical oxidation.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:44.280]   It actually destroys tiny, harmful pollutants.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.280]   Things like, things that no filter will capture, like volatile organic compounds,
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:57.280]   paint thinner in the air for meldaide, viruses, yes, bacteria, yes, mold, yes.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:03.280]   Molecule air purifiers help protect homes, businesses, even medical spaces.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:08.280]   In fact, I should mention the Molecule AirPro RX uses the same technology.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:16.280]   Got FDA approval, 510K Class II medical device specifically for medical offices to
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:19.280]   destroy bacteria and viruses in the air.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:21.280]   It really works.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:27.280]   In fact, if you go to the Molecule website, you can see research papers from government
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:32.280]   research labs, DOE labs, like the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, where they tested the molecule
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.280]   and found it actually eliminated formaldehyde from the air.
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.280]   One of the things Molecule does is great.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:41.280]   Some air purifiers put ozone into the air.
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.280]   Molecule also reduces ozone, another harmful compound in the air.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.280]   And by the way, yes, Molecule's PECO technology meets the performance requirements
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:56.280]   and the FDA guidance for use in helping to reduce the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2,
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.280]   the COVID-19 virus in healthcare settings.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:03.280]   Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't wash your hands and practice social distancing
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:07.280]   and wear masks, but it is, that's one of the reasons we're really glad that Molecule
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.280]   is in the studio.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:12.280]   It's an extra layer of virus protection for your spaces.
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.280]   I am very impressed.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:19.280]   Dirty indoor air is actually worse than outside air.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:22.280]   And a lot of offices, you can't open the windows.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.280]   You can't open the windows here.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.280]   It's a sealed office.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.280]   That means the air in here is not great.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:30.280]   That's why you need to get a Molecule.
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.280]   A Molecule air mini designed for smaller rooms up to 250 square feet.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.280]   Your bedroom, it'd be perfect.
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.280]   The larger Molecule air, for larger rooms up to 600 square feet,
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:42.280]   we've got the Molecule air pro.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.280]   That's for 1,000 square feet.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.280]   I'm looking at it right now.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:49.280]   Actually, one of the reasons we had to have it is after the wildfires a couple of years
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.280]   ago, it made it impossible to be inside because of all the smoke.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.280]   Took care of that.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:59.280]   They also have a Molecule air mini plus which helps protect small rooms with a particle sensor
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:05.280]   and auto protect mode so the fan speed is adjusted depending on the quality of the air.
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.280]   We just love our Molecules.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.280]   I mean Molecules.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:10.280]   I've invested quite a bit in Molecules.

[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:50.280]   It really does work.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:51.280]   Molecule.
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:53.280]   We love Molecule.com.

[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:02.280]   We are probably something like a week away from a new iPhone.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.280]   It's unclear.
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.280]   Typically, Apple will do it early in September.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:13.280]   No one's saying best guess would be I think not this week, but on the 14th.
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:19.280]   There was a wild rumor that Apple would add satellite features to its phone.
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:23.280]   That it would use low Earth orbit, satellite specifically from GlobalStar,
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:28.280]   to provide emergency services on the phone.
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.280]   This originally came from an analyst.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:36.280]   Let me pause that so we don't hear the video from Bloomberg.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:42.280]   Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who's usually very well connected,
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.280]   kind of tamped down the speculation.
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:50.280]   He said, "The next iPhone could have hardware needed for satellite communications,
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.280]   but he says even if they do, the features are unlikely to be ready
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:57.280]   before next year, according to a person who has to not be identified
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.280]   because the plans are not yet public."
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:03.280]   Bloomberg also, this is bullet boilerplate now in all Apple rumor stories.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.280]   These features could also change or be scrapped before they're released,
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:09.280]   and Apple representative declined to comment.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.280]   But Mark had a lot of detailed information.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.280]   I think this is probably a good thing.
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:15.280]   Emergency message via satellite.
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:20.280]   So if you are lost or injured and you're outside satellite,
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:26.280]   you could send a message in your messages app using not SMS,
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:32.280]   the phone network, or IMES, message using data, but using satellites.
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:35.280]   And you'd get a gray message bubble instead of green or blue.
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.280]   I like that.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:39.280]   The second feature will be a tool to report major emergencies
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:44.280]   like plane crashes, sinking ships, also using satellite networks.
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:49.280]   The texting via satellite tool is codenamed "stuwe" inside Apple,
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.280]   and they will be short length.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:55.280]   They'll push through to an emergency phone's emergency contacts phone,
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:58.280]   so the do not disturb setting is on.
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:00.280]   So I think this is a good thing.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.280]   We'll see if it happens.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:06.280]   And Apple event, if it happens, will be, we'll certainly stream it.
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:12.280]   And I'm going to guess, my best guess is September 14th,
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:16.280]   which is a week from Tuesday.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:18.280]   Anybody want to say anything about that?
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.280]   I like this idea.
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:22.280]   I think it's a great idea, right?
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:27.280]   If we had this idea, we wouldn't have that movie 127 hours with James Franco.
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.280]   Guy would have to chew his arm off.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:30.280]   That's right.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:34.280]   And the rock and pull out the iPhone and you'd text "Hey, I'm a duck book" and then you're saved.
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.280]   So I'm into it.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:37.280]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.280]   I mean, there are devices you can buy or rent.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.280]   Spot watches stuff.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.280]   My daughter rents one when she goes hiking in the backcountry,
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:47.280]   just for emergencies.
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:52.280]   There are two different kinds of this kind of emergency stuff.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:59.280]   REI had a good article there, the bank, the camping supply company.
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:06.280]   They sell both personal trackers and then messengers, emergency messengers, spot watches.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.280]   I think a good thing to have.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.280]   And certainly these are small.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:13.280]   There's no reason you couldn't have that technology in an iPhone or even an Apple watch.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:19.280]   So I will hope that that is the case.
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.280]   I guess that wasn't a good conversation starter.
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.280]   So let me find another one.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.280]   How about Texas?
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.280]   [laughter]
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:28.280]   Oh boy, let me get him out of portion.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:31.280]   No, we're not going to talk about abortion.
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:37.280]   But there is a tech angle to this, which is that this law, which again,
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:45.280]   is kind of gamifying Roe v. Wade would encourage private people to snitch on abortion providers
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:48.280]   or anybody who abits, aids or abits an abortion.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:57.280]   And in order to do this, they set up websites to do this, which immediately stimulated action
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:59.280]   from the tech sector.
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:01.280]   Silicon Valley responded right away.
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.280]   GoDaddy, the initial website, which was set up on GoDaddy, was shut down within a day.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:12.280]   They moved to a digital ocean, which I think has already shut it down.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:17.280]   Mark Benney off has canceled all of Salesforce's business in -- oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:21.280]   That was in Indiana when they did something similar.
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:27.280]   I imagine there'll be a bit of a backlash.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.280]   Did you see the Uber?
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:31.280]   Right.
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:32.280]   Exactly.
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:35.280]   So the idea is if you drive someone to the abortion clinic, can you be sued for $10,000?
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:36.280]   Yes.
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:38.280]   Is that what they're saying?
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:40.280]   Yes, because you're aiding in a bedding.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:41.280]   For an Uber driver.
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:47.280]   Plus, it incense somebody who sees that because there's a $10,000 reward to go onto the website
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:50.280]   and say, "Hey, I just saw somebody leave for an abortion clinic in an Uber."
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:54.280]   So if you're an Uber driver, you have somebody certified that you're not going to get an abortion.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.280]   No.
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.280]   Uber and Lyft has announced they will pay legal fees.
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:59.280]   Good.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.280]   And what about an airline?
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.280]   What if you fly to another state?
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:07.280]   Can the airline be sued or is that okay because you're not getting the abortion in Texas?
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:11.280]   That would be federal jurisdiction, not state, so they can't get you for that.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.280]   I would hope that --
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:13.280]   That would happen to --
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:14.280]   Whatever happened to --
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.280]   Whatever happened to --
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:16.280]   When I --
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.280]   When I --
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.280]   I would have to fly.
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:22.280]   This is -- you know, they talk about Sharia law.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:24.280]   I think we're getting close.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:29.280]   Well, doesn't Texas respect the right of businesses to make their own decisions and whatever happened?
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.280]   Yeah, that used to be --
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:32.280]   Yeah, that used to be a rule, right?
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:41.280]   Already, TikTok users are flooding the Texas abortion site with fake tips.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:46.280]   Apparently, it's pretty easy to generate a fake address for -- that's in Texas.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:51.280]   So the website ProfileWistleBlower.com, which is set up by Texas Right to Life.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:58.280]   That's the one that got kicked from GoDaddy and elsewhere, is being flooded with phony tips.
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:00.280]   Don't mess with 4chan, man.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.280]   Don't mess with them.
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:06.280]   Kind of funny, because don't mess with Texas if they --
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:08.280]   -- almost appreciate it.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:19.280]   Doesn't that -- Leo, doesn't it freak you out a little bit when people organize and end up taking political action via TikTok because at the end of day it is a Chinese company and I don't mean to fear monger.
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:25.280]   But, you know, is there a point where the Chinese government exerts its influence over that company and ends up doing something --
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:26.280]   Yeah, Hong Kong.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:34.280]   -- using the users there to either start a political movement or using its influence to shut one down.
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:35.280]   Yeah, you can't see this.
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.280]   You can't pour in these stories.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:40.280]   Can you, in the U.S. post-Pro-Hong Kong TikToks or would you think --
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:41.280]   Yeah, if you can.
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.280]   I think you can.
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:44.280]   But the U.S. only pick up that.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:46.280]   Especially during the protests.
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:48.280]   They took all of that down and they lied about it.
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:49.280]   Right.
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:50.280]   Exactly.
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:55.280]   So, you know, there was that also at an incident where they kept on buying tickets to Trump's --
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:59.280]   first big rally and no one showed up because they just expected all these TikToks.
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.280]   That was a TikTok grandmother who organized that.
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:04.280]   Yeah, there are people that celebrate this stuff.
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:08.280]   But every time it happens, I become a little bit wary and think that, you know --
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:10.280]   I think Larry Magg is one of those people.
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:13.280]   He just wrote a seniors guy to TikTok.
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:14.280]   I did.
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:15.280]   You didn't have to turn that.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.280]   It's not a seniors guy to TikTok hacktivism, though, I gotta say.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:24.280]   No, it's a seniors guy to -- well, we talk about all the things you can do on TikTok, which include actors.
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:29.280]   But it also includes, you know, recipes and health tips.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:32.280]   And it turns out there are a lot of seniors that I can't remember.
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:36.280]   11% of TikTokers are over 50, which is something that a lot of people --
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.280]   I didn't know that until I read that.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:39.280]   I was surprised.
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.280]   And a lot of people with gray hair like me are using TikTok.
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:46.280]   Do you, Dan Patterson, not use TikTok because of what they did in Hong Kong?
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:48.280]   Does that -- like Alex says --
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:49.280]   No, no.
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:50.280]   No.
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:51.280]   No.
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.280]   I would use it to learn about Hong Kong.
[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:57.280]   No, I don't use -- I don't have any social media on my phone.
[01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:00.280]   In part because I'm worried about what it does to me as a person.
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:05.280]   And in part because, especially with TikTok -- and again, I also don't want to fear Manger.
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:14.280]   But the data that's hovered up by Facebook, TikTok, and others is not something -- it's not an exchange I'm willing to engage in.
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:15.280]   And I don't derive value.
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:22.280]   I mean, there is value from these things, but I don't derive enough value or pleasure from them to make them work that compromised.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.280]   I don't have a Facebook or WhatsApp account.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:25.280]   I don't -- right.
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:26.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.280]   Right.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:35.280]   I found -- I just found -- I mean, I deleted my Insta, Graham, and Facebook years and years ago, but I just found that it made me feel worse.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:40.280]   Like maybe in the moment there would be some dopamine pings, but at the end of the day it made me feel worse.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:42.280]   And I just didn't like that feeling.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:50.280]   But also, I just -- look, I'm not trying to always be down on technology firms and social media companies, but I don't trust them.
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:53.280]   And I don't trust what it's designed to do.
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:57.280]   It is addictive technology, or at least it appears to be addictive technology.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:58.280]   And I don't want it on my phone.
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:01.280]   It's not China, per se, that bothers you.
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:03.280]   It's just the platform.
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.280]   It's the algorithms, and it's the amount of data that they gather.
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:10.280]   But Alex, it's China that worries you.
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:14.280]   I mean, I'm personally bothered by the China thing, for sure.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.280]   Yeah.
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:26.280]   I ended up taking TikTok off my phone, I mean, maybe partially because of that, but also, I took part like a couple months in the pandemic and said I was going to learn TikTok.
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.280]   And boy did I learn it.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:29.280]   I got so addicted to the thing.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.280]   It's very addicted to this.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:36.280]   At the same time, there were some nights where I like finished work and I was like, I just want to lay down in bed and be on TikTok, and I would be on for a couple hours.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:40.280]   And I said, you know, it's much like my dad said, I'm just like, I'm done with this.
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.280]   So I deleted that.
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.280]   I deleted Instagram and, you know, I don't miss it.
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:45.280]   Yeah.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:48.280]   See, so I killed two birds of one stone.
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:02:01.280]   Maybe I have maybe I don't have an addictive personality, although there are things that I feel like I overused, but I just, you know, look at TikTok for a few minutes now and then and just kind of laugh and move on.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:11.280]   And if anything, I probably used too much Facebook, because what happens is I get really, I'm a very political person and I get irritated by things that go on in the world and I want to complain a lot.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:14.280]   So I can vech a lot on Facebook.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:17.280]   But I guess I am willing to make those trade offs.
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:19.280]   The ones that some of you guys aren't going to make.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.280]   I do derive value from them.
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:22.280]   Okay.
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.280]   So I'm not sure how China would use TikTok.
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:38.280]   I guess it could, you know, it could create a quote simulated grassroots movement to, I don't know, get somebody elected president for instance.
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:39.280]   Any TikTok user could do that.
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.280]   But anybody could do that.
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:41.280]   Yeah, but China.
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:56.280]   But oh, no, no, it's different though, because yeah, if you use your influence over a company as a sovereign nation where that company is based to have them push their algorithms to get not just one person, but lots of people, you know, moving forward toward a political movement.
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:01.280]   That was very, very different from an individual user trying to change things.
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.280]   So it's not, it's not even like what Russia did with Facebook, which like we can have a debate about what that was effective or not.
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.280]   But they were like, we're going to use Facebook's algorithms and, you know, put fake accounts there to do it.
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:26.280]   The worry is that they use the, they use their influence over TikTok to get the company to change the algorithms to turn up or turn down some political movement and then cause some sort of disruption or something unnatural here in the US.
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:28.280]   I think that's what it is.
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.280]   And as you know, that's, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:42.280]   And I mean, I'm sure you've had these conversations, Alex, but I've had conversations with people at Facebook who say, yeah, we react and not in the ways that you think we are not as liberal as you think.
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:45.280]   And the decision makers certainly aren't as liberal as you think.
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.280]   And we certainly react.
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:52.280]   Well, and let's be fair, doesn't matter what political point of view they're espousing.
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.280]   If they're doing it, it's bad, right?
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:59.280]   Just because it just agrees with my progressive politics, doesn't make it worse than.
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:00.280]   Right.
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:01.280]   That's precisely it.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:02.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:02.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:05.280]   Whether they're left or right, anything that's doing that, it would be bad.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:10.280]   On the other hand, I kind of have some sympathy for what China's doing to big tech.
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:14.280]   You know, they shut down DD, they shut down Alibaba, now the latest.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:17.280]   This one I'm not sure I agree with, but I kind of understand.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:25.280]   They've told teenagers, you can only play video games three hours a week, Friday, Saturday,
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:32.280]   and Sunday, 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. and on national holidays, three hours, three days a week,
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:35.280]   and they even say the specific time.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:39.280]   God, you couldn't do that in the U.S. Can you imagine?
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:42.280]   No, no metaverse in China.
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:44.280]   And yeah, I think--
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.280]   Well, Karen can't even do that.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:46.280]   I kind of respect that.
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:47.280]   That's like them.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.280]   Yeah, but I couldn't do it as a parent.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:49.280]   I tried.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:51.280]   My parents did it to me.
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:53.280]   They said half an hour of TV a night.
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:54.280]   That was tough.
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:59.280]   I had the router in my office with my daughter with a teenager and I would just unplug
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:00.280]   the Wi-Fi network.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:06.280]   I did a little more modern thing, but I would have the Euro shut off the network at 10 p.m.
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:08.280]   at school nights.
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:13.280]   But one hour for three nights a week, wow.
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:14.280]   Yeah.
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:18.280]   I don't suppose we'll hear a lot of protests at the Chinese teenagers.
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:22.280]   I bet most Chinese adults say, yeah, that's right.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:24.280]   That's a good thing.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:28.280]   It's not something I want the Biden administration to emulate.
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:30.280]   There's all this--
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:32.280]   It's allegedly--
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:33.280]   Go ahead.
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:34.280]   You, Alex, then Dan.
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:35.280]   No, no.
[02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.280]   Yeah, go ahead, Alex.
[02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:42.280]   I mean, there's all this hate and I get it about screen time and there are legitimate concerns there.
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:57.280]   One of the things that this stuff does, video games and social media gets kids to think creatively, think outside the box, think abstractly, think outside of the rules of the, you know, in real life universe that we live in.
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:58.280]   And all these--
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:05:59.280]   They collaborate, too.
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:03.280]   --are going to be exactly-- and all these skills are going to be critical in the next wave of work.
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:07.280]   We're like, up until now, we've had a take orders and fulfill orders type of workplace.
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:13.280]   But all those skills that they're building in social media in the gaming world are going to become critical for the jobs of tomorrow.
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:20.280]   And so when you shut that off, you do shut off in a key training place, you know, for your next generation to learn.
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:30.280]   I guess we'll know in 10 years if Chinese young adults are inept at social media, if it's going to hurt their economy.
[02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:32.280]   Dan, what do you think?
[02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:42.280]   Well, and it's not-- it's only under 18. I've been told something similar, and then it's to help redirect strategic focus, whatever that means in a statement.
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:46.280]   But I think that could be a euphemism that kind of means a lot of--
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:54.280]   Actually, there's a lot of thinking I've read that says really what China is doing is it wants its tech sector to focus on innovation that helps--
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:55.280]   On AI.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:58.280]   --on AI innovation that helps the country and not on consumer--
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:03.280]   You know, all of our stuff is now consumer innovation, Facebook and Instagram and stuff.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:04.280]   And they want to stop that.
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:10.280]   They said, "No, you know what? We want to redirect strategically redirect our energies towards stuff that builds--
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:12.280]   That's the US argument.
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:22.280]   Yeah, our argument is that-- or the US is arguing that this is the reason China is doing this, to redirect strategic focus towards activities where--
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:25.280]   There's opportunity costs towards what you spend your time on, and they're--
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:26.280]   Right.
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:30.280]   --allegedly they're redirecting towards things like AI and other technologies that will be--
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:31.280]   Don't you think--
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:32.280]   --of greater benefit?
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:36.280]   Is that a mistake? Do you think the Chinese are doing something different, or do you think that that's accurate?
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.280]   Is this going to be around any year or two?
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:43.280]   The ban, this age restriction?
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:47.280]   Oh, I don't know. Do they have a history of backing down and stuff like that?
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:49.280]   I don't know.
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:53.280]   Well, if it is, it's a grand experiment.
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:08:04.280]   The thing is, it may have some strategic advantage for China, but of a general parenting policy to limit screen time to an arbitrary number of minutes or hours a day or time.
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:06.280]   That's what I told my mom and dad.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:08.280]   It's exactly what I told them.
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:15.280]   Well, I mean, when a kid's playing a soccer game, the parent doesn't arbitrarily say, "Hey, time for dinner. We're going to--"
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:20.280]   --you quit the soccer game. I mean, these are collaborative exchanges of people.
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:26.280]   I know there are problems with overuse, and kids need to be reigned in, but I don't like the arbitrary nature.
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:32.280]   I mean, aside from the fact it's coming from the government, which is something that would not be tolerated, hopefully, in this country,
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:35.280]   I don't like the arbitrary nature and the way they're doing it.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:41.280]   I wouldn't mind seeing a program to encourage kids to exercise more and do other things,
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:47.280]   but the idea of this arbitrary time limit, one size fits all. This is the way it's got to be.
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:51.280]   It doesn't make sense, even when it's coming from the parent, let alone from the government.
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.280]   And do you think our best AI engineers didn't play video games?
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:59.280]   I mean, that's nuts. Of course, they spent their days in video games.
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:02.280]   I agree. I mean, I've seen-- I've seen about what to build.
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:08.280]   I've seen pathological use of this, but for most part, this is the future.
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:12.280]   Kids are going to operate in a world that is not like my world.
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:15.280]   My parents don't want me to listen to rock and roll, and now I'm a rock and roll DJ.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:22.280]   No, that's wrong. But you know, I mean, you got to understand that culture's changed, and this is the current culture.
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:24.280]   Every generation has moral panics.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:26.280]   That's right. That's right.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:32.280]   I had to cut my hair and stop. No, my parents said, "Grow your hair along and listen to more rock and roll, but stop watching Batman."
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:34.280]   They did not want me to watch Batman.
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:40.280]   We're going to take a little break, and then I have a bunch of short, quick stories so we can get you out of here.
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:44.280]   I know it's been a long show, but I can't stop talking to you guys. You're great.
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.280]   But we'll wrap it up in just a little bit.
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:51.280]   First, though, a look at the week that was on Twitch.
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:55.280]   Wow! Graduates, School of Journalism at City University.
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:59.280]   Oh, look who's appeared! It's like Beatles!
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:02.280]   What is happening?
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:05.280]   That's Craig Newmark.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:08.280]   Previously on Twitch. This week in Google.
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:15.280]   Craig is, of course, the Craig of Craig's list, but lately has been a great philanthropist.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:19.280]   I really do listen to the show fairly religiously.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:23.280]   I am very much looking forward to the moral panic.
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:34.280]   Tech News Weekly.
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:41.280]   I thought I'd spend a little time just going hands-on with the Galaxy Z Fold 3.
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:46.280]   Unfolded. The inside display is a 7.6 inch display.
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:49.280]   And the screen types are different. Obviously, this is a foldable.
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:52.280]   So you can kind of see there's a little bit of a crease there.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:57.280]   A short series of shows with Paul going to Linux Idiot.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:00.280]   Yeah, we'll talk to Linux Idiot.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.280]   Hey, I noticed there's no ads in this thing.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.280]   Where do I turn on the ads?
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:06.280]   I come from Windows.
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.280]   We have album art for your new show. I just want to...
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:13.280]   Linux for Paul's.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:16.280]   This is your brain. This is your brain on Twitch.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.280]   Any questions?
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:21.280]   A lot of fun this week on the show.
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:23.280]   I showed it a brought to you by another podcast.
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:29.280]   If I can give a plug, Kevin Rose was here a couple of weeks ago talking about his modern finance podcast.
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:37.280]   I have to say, we kind of try to dissect the world of modern finance, but really Kevin is the expert.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:40.280]   The investment world is changing quite a bit.
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:43.280]   Kevin is one of the leading investors.
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:45.280]   He was the founder of Dig.
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:49.280]   Early investor in some of the biggest tech companies in the world worked at Google Ventures.
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.280]   He's now a true ventures.
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:55.280]   Bloomberg called him one of the top 25 angel investors in the country.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:00.280]   Time magazine says Kevin Rose is one of the top 25 most influential people on the web.
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:02.280]   He's also a smart guy.
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:05.280]   And his modern finance is the podcast to listen to.
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:12.280]   If you want to know more about Bitcoin, NFTs, Robo Investors, Decentralized Finance.
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:14.280]   It's fantastic.
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:15.280]   He interviews...
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:16.280]   Actually, it's smart.
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:18.280]   He does two different podcasts a week.
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:19.280]   One is...
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:25.280]   He calls them the consensus episodes where they explore weekly news distill into digestible information.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:31.280]   Show two is deeper interviews with the individual crypto founders, NFT artists, some of the biggest
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:33.280]   names in the business.
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:35.280]   I didn't understand NFTs at all.
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.280]   I'm going to be the first to admit it until I listened to.
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:40.280]   It was actually his premier episode on NFTs.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:43.280]   Kevin has done very well, by the way, in NFTs.
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:50.280]   If you're curious, if you'd like to know more, join Kevin Rose and the modern finance podcast.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:53.280]   Every single week, you will not want to miss an episode.
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:13:00.360]   It helps you make sense of all the coins, the chaos, the NFTs that are, I think, changing
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:03.280]   the world in a very significant way.
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:04.280]   Boy, Kevin is connected.
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:05.280]   He really gets the people on.
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:09.760]   Now is the time to equip yourself with the knowledge of where things are going.
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:14.840]   The financial landscape is harder than ever to navigate, but you don't have to do it alone.
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:19.280]   Download and subscribe to Modern Finance, wherever you listen to podcasts.
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:21.480]   Kevin Rose's Modern Finance.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:25.280]   You get it wherever you listen to podcasts, Apple or Google or...
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.600]   There's also a website, Modern.Finance.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:29.520]   I love Kevin.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.480]   I am thrilled to plug his podcast.
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:33.800]   Don't be the last person on the next train out.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:39.880]   Just to modern finance and get ahead of the future of finance.
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:43.960]   Really interesting stuff and the greatest people on there.
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:44.960]   Modern finance.
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:50.000]   Thank you, Kevin, for being a good friend and for a great podcast.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:55.440]   I don't normally like to plug other people's podcasts, but Kevin doesn't make it an exception.
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:00.600]   Modern.Finance is the website or mofi.net, your choice.
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:04.600]   A couple of quick short stories before we get out of here.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:10.840]   Some big, I think, changes in certain ways and other things.
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:16.440]   According to front page tech, John Prosser, Google's Pixel 6 will be coming October 28th.
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.720]   That seems reasonable.
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:21.000]   Google has decided to delay the return to office.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.800]   A lot of companies doing this.
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:25.240]   Till next year, it's kind of indefinite.
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:27.520]   Apple 2.
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:28.680]   Apple doing this as well.
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:30.000]   Apple 2 is confusing.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000]   Apple 2.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000]   Apple 2.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.000]   Apple 2.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.640]   Apple O.
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:35.640]   Apple also.
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:36.640]   There, that's good.
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.760]   You and I are the only ones in this, whoever probably ever used in Apple 2.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:42.280]   We remember the Apple 2.
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:45.160]   Isn't it funny how it's going to move so fast?
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:48.400]   At this point, that's ancient history.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:50.560]   Stuff like that.
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:53.840]   Facebook Find, Facebook's What's App.
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:15:04.160]   By the EU for $270 million for privacy violations, they failed to disclose fully how it collected
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:06.400]   and shared data about users.
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:08.160]   Surprise, surprise, surprise.
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:11.200]   I think Facebook can afford that.
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:17.320]   But it's still a hefty amount of money, a quarter of a billion.
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:20.360]   Twitter has launched its super follows on iOS.
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:25.080]   And yes, Apple gets 30% of each and every super follow.
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:27.160]   You can now charge for tweets.
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:29.360]   Congratulations.
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:32.200]   I'm not rushing to sign up for that.
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:34.040]   And a percentage to Twitter.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:36.080]   So you're giving Twitter money and you're giving Apple money.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.480]   And what are you left with at the end of the day?
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:41.640]   I love it that Twitter is just closed exactly how much everybody's getting.
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:46.480]   So you don't feel bad about the 30 cents you get on the dollar.
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:56.400]   I'm kind of a little bit mad at my friend, Darren Kitchen, whose site is now selling
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:01.280]   a USB-C to lightning cable that can steal your passwords and other data.
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:09.160]   The OMG cable, which was debuted, I think it was at DEF CON last year, is now being--
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:10.640]   That's a hoodspoke selling it.
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:13.480]   Yeah, that's being mass produced.
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:17.520]   And sold on Hack 5.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:19.280]   Yeah, it's a little bit of much about it.
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:20.280]   I'll buy it.
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:26.600]   Yeah, well, this thing is Darren's always sold a lot of hacking tools on Hack 5's website.
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:32.880]   But boy, Apple did not respond to a motherboards request for comment.
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:42.280]   The cables include these indistinguishable from Apple's Type A to lightning cables.
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:45.640]   There are also USB-C to USB-C cables.
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:49.840]   I mean, the thing that's important to understand is now you can put chipsets that are so small
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:52.520]   without modifying the cable in any significant way.
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:58.440]   You could put a radio in there that streams out everything you're using.
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:00.840]   And the motherboard tested it in downtown Oakland.
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:05.560]   They were able to trigger payloads-- Oh, no, I'm sorry, MG tested it.
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:06.560]   And over a mile.
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:11.280]   You could be a mile away and see what's going over those cables.
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:17.440]   They've even added a geo-fenching feature where a user can trigger or block the device's
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:20.760]   payloads based on the physical location of the cable.
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:23.600]   So as long as it stays in the victim's house, it works otherwise.
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:25.520]   Don't worry about it.
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:28.400]   Anyway, I just thought I'd let you know.
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:31.880]   Hack5.com if you want to buy one of those.
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:39.040]   And I guess the bottom line, don't trust any cables unless you know where they came from.
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.760]   Don't enjoy your Labor Day weekend if you're an IT.
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:50.920]   The US government is telling IT professionals patch your Atlassian Confluence immediately.
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:57.200]   CVE-2021-26084 is ongoing and ongoing zero-day.
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:02.600]   And the US cybercom actually said, "This cannot wait till after the weekend."
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:04.360]   I'll do it Tuesday.
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:05.600]   It's Labor Day.
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:06.600]   No.
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:12.600]   It's a zero-day.
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.200]   Qualcomm has debuted a new Bluetooth technology that says, "We'll give you CD quality.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:18.200]   It's lossless."
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:21.960]   It'll be in the next generation of Snapdragon chips.
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:25.280]   It's called aptX lossless.
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:27.240]   But you can't get it on an iPhone.
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:28.240]   Hey, Elio.
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:29.800]   My Bluetooth player just broke.
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.360]   Should I bother replacing it?
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:34.720]   Is there any reason to own a Bluetooth DVD player these days?
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:35.720]   I mean, Blu-ray.
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:36.720]   I'm sorry, Blu-ray.
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:37.720]   Don't confuse them.
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:41.000]   I'm sorry, all blues are different.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.240]   I was half-listening to you.
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:46.080]   I feel like this is a question for the tech guy.
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:48.440]   My Bluetooth DVD player died.
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:49.440]   No, Blu-ray, Blu-ray.
[02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:50.440]   No.
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:51.440]   No, I wouldn't.
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:55.840]   Well, that's actually a great debate.
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:57.160]   It's physical media debt.
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:59.480]   I've been saying physical media is dead forever.
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.400]   You can get my wife, she keeps going to the library and bringing back these DVDs.
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:06.120]   Then you need to get another one.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:07.120]   I'm sorry to say.
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:08.520]   The good news is they're cheap.
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:09.960]   I would get a UHD one.
[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:11.360]   Do you have a 4K TV?
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:12.360]   Yeah.
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:13.360]   Well, get a UHD one.
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:14.360]   Then you can upgrade it to 4K.
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:18.240]   Not if it encouraged my wife to keep going to the library and bringing back physical media
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.840]   because it's driving nuts.
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:21.600]   Anyway, sorry to interrupt.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:25.080]   No, that's a great question.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:26.640]   But this is not about Blu-ray.
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:27.640]   There's about Bluetooth.
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:28.640]   I'm sorry.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:33.440]   It's like for reading while you're talking.
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:35.040]   Thank you, Emily Latella.
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:38.600]   There's another outdated reference.
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:40.960]   You know what I'm talking about?
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:44.360]   Gilda Radner's character on Saturday Night Live.
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:50.600]   What's all this about Bluetooth TV day players?
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:51.600]   Never mind.
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:52.600]   Never mind.
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:53.600]   Never mind.
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:57.280]   Amazon's about to launch a TV.
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:01.160]   Probably somebody else will make it.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:02.160]   These are all...
[02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:04.960]   You know, I'm glad with these are the shorties because there was no conversation.
[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:06.960]   These are not conversation starters.
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:11.560]   Well, if he misinterpreted Bluetooth and Blu-ray, you've got some of your comments.
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:12.560]   Thank you.
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:13.560]   You want it to be a little...
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:15.360]   At least just started a conversation.
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:16.360]   Thank you.
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:17.360]   Yeah.
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:22.440]   Apple is buying my favorite streaming classical music service, Prime Fonic.
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:27.040]   And they immediately put it out of business, which pisses the hell out of me.
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:29.800]   They say, "We're going to do a version later."
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:30.800]   Great.
[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:33.040]   So what do I do between now and then?
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:34.040]   I did get a refund.
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:36.320]   Like a US Airbot PSA and then put it out of business.
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:37.320]   Yeah.
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:38.320]   You destroyed a great airline.
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:39.920]   Yeah, I love PSA.
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:43.560]   I love the Stourdes outfits on PSA.
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:46.000]   That's how I used to fly to school every year.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000]   PSA had...
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.000]   It was like South West.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.000]   I can't.
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.000]   Well, no, I was...
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.000]   Yes, I was moving on.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.960]   But okay, we can talk about the hot pants.
[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:55.960]   I don't think people should...
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:56.960]   It is a flight attendant, thank you.
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:57.960]   Yeah.
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:20:59.680]   I don't think flight attendants should be required to wear hot pants.
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.680]   I agree.
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:03.640]   But they did.
[02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:08.120]   And sports, they were famous for their outfits.
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:12.240]   But they also had $10 flight between LA and San Francisco, which is why I love them.
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:13.480]   That's why I flew them to school.
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:14.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:15.480]   And they also had...
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:19.920]   I think it was open seating like Southwest does now, but they also had seats facing each
[02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:20.920]   other.
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:21.920]   They were like a little lounge.
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:24.080]   Yeah, I loved that.
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:25.080]   Yeah.
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:28.800]   Anyway, sorry.
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:31.560]   Just to put this in perspective, Larry and I were in our early 20s.
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:32.560]   We didn't know any better.
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:33.560]   We thought...
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:34.560]   I didn't appreciate it.
[02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:37.320]   I thought school actually did appreciate it.
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:40.480]   I thought that even back then I knew that was sexist.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:41.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:43.520]   And the flight attendant for their safety, not for...
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:44.520]   Thank you.
[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:46.200]   Boy, you really were very politically right.
[02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:47.360]   I was ahead of the time, yeah.
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:48.760]   You were way ahead of the time.
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:49.760]   I was.
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:50.760]   All right.
[02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:52.880]   Don't do Berkeley.
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:54.760]   Anything else?
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:56.240]   Yeah, of course.
[02:21:56.240 --> 02:22:01.440]   No wonder you flew to flu PSA.
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:02.920]   House Committee investigating...
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:05.840]   I guess we should have started with this one because I bet you guys will have something
[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:07.280]   to say about this.
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:14.200]   The House Committee investigating the January 6th insurrection has gone on a social media
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:17.360]   fishing expedition.
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:19.480]   They're asking for records from everybody.
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:25.080]   Google and Reddit and Snapchat and Telegram, but also TikTok, Twitch, Twitter, YouTube,
[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:31.400]   4chan, Acoon, Facebook, Gabb and Parler, everybody.
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:33.960]   It's well within their purview, I think.
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:35.880]   I wouldn't call that a fishing exposition.
[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.440]   I don't like the frame on that.
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:44.360]   This seems to be doing their job, subpoenaing records about a crime.
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:45.360]   Okay.
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:46.360]   Okay.
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:50.120]   You can call it fishing, whatever.
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:54.280]   There are some things that maybe they shouldn't have asked for that they did, including internal
[02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:59.720]   communications reports, documents and other materials relating to internal employee concerns
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:02.800]   about content on the platform.
[02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:06.200]   That seems like more than going after...
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:07.200]   They shouldn't do that.
[02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:08.200]   ... dividers.
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:09.920]   They probably shouldn't do that.
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:13.160]   I'm actually just reading the headline from Tech Dirt.
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:14.160]   That's where the social media...
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:15.160]   Oh, I know.
[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:16.160]   I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:17.640]   I just don't like to remove this.
[02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:18.640]   No, that's exactly why...
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:20.680]   This is what the government should be doing.
[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:22.200]   Do you think they're doing the right thing?
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:29.920]   I don't know precisely what they're doing, but there is a crime and we know how and where
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:33.680]   much of the crime was planned.
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:37.240]   Like we talked about at the very beginning of this argument, or discussion, a show, I'm
[02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:42.160]   sorry for saying argument, but there's a difference between asking for reasonable things that
[02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:45.600]   help prosecute a crime and asking for unreasonable things.
[02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:46.600]   I mean, I...
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:47.600]   Well taken.
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:48.600]   That's all.
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:49.600]   That's all.
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:52.480]   Yeah, and if they're doing anything, can we pinch on people's right, for example, to
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:54.480]   attend the rally, which was legal.
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:56.560]   I hated it, but it was legal.
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:59.520]   There's a big difference between that and people who are breaking into the Capitol.
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:03.200]   It just really depends on what they're asking for and where it's leading.
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:07.720]   I have no problem with them asking for stuff that was posted publicly, even if it was later
[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:09.400]   pulled down.
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:10.920]   I think that's the bulk of it.
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:11.920]   It's public.
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:14.400]   The internal private stuff, I think, probably...
[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:16.360]   Well, they have the right to do it.
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:18.320]   It's a congressional subpoena.
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:21.200]   It has the weight of law behind it.
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:25.800]   Also, sometimes, just to close this off, sometimes things are complicated in this world
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:27.960]   and sometimes they're really simple.
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:31.160]   And I feel like we're trying to make this more complicated than it is.
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:33.680]   And by we, I mean, I don't know maybe the discussion in the country, right?
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:38.560]   Like at the end of the day, there was one guy who was the president who told all of his
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:43.040]   supporters to come down to DC on the day that they were going to start to count the electoral
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:47.200]   votes, told them it was going to be wild, and then marched them down to the Capitol
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:48.760]   and they went.
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:50.440]   And yet there might have been some communication.
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:54.800]   But I think the danger is that what Congress does is makes this more about the technology
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:57.760]   companies than about the guy they go to March and March.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.720]   Actually, that's an excellent point.
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:00.720]   You didn't...
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:03.560]   Well, I want to push back on that a little bit.
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:08.680]   Look, I don't know what Congress is asking for from the technology companies, and they
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:12.400]   should not ask for more than what is legal.
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:18.000]   I'm not justifying Congress and certainly not the technology companies, but that's not
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.680]   all the president, the former president did, nor is it all that happened prior.
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:27.720]   And there was planning of violence that happened prior.
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:29.400]   These were conversations that were happening.
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:30.520]   Some were happening private.
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:31.880]   Some were happening publicly.
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:37.240]   But this wasn't one situation where a president directed his followers to go and it would be
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:39.480]   wild, and then it just happened to be wild.
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:41.520]   No, there was premeditation to this.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:49.960]   I do have to love the cluelessness of Matt Gates, Lauren Borbert, Louis Gohmert, who's,
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:57.240]   by the way, the guy who thought the Bureau of Forestry and Land and Forestry Management
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:01.720]   could move the moon to improve climate change.
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:08.120]   And other members of Congress who wrote a letter saying, "To Marissa Meyer, president
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:15.560]   and CEO of Yahoo, this is two days ago," they wrote this letter saying, "Do not turn over
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:18.080]   any of our records.
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.080]   Marissa, please."
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:20.960]   I don't think she's enough out here to go.
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:22.800]   I don't think she has those records.
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:23.800]   I'll be honest with you.
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:25.800]   They can be sure, Marissa, is asking to turn that stuff up.
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:28.760]   I'm not going to be sure that's the confidence of Congress.
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:31.120]   And I'm not trying to be rude to Alex either.
[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:32.120]   They sent it to all the telecoms.
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:33.840]   No, you're welcome to disagree, man.
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:35.200]   They're looking for telecom records too.
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:36.200]   But I think you're right.
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:40.320]   If the crime is committed, it's not a phishing expedition unless they're asking for every
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:45.320]   bit of the data they're saying for these specific people, that's not a phishing expedition.
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:46.320]   That's an investigation.
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.080]   Of course, it's an investigation, but let's not lose sight of the fact that it wasn't
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:51.080]   Facebook and Twitter.
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:52.080]   It wasn't their fault.
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:53.080]   No, I agree.
[02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:57.920]   And if it wasn't, if the people who organized on a Facebook group, they would have organized
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.400]   on a telegram group if they couldn't have been on Facebook and at the end of the day,
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:05.040]   they were there in January 6 because the commander-in-chief told them to be there on
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:06.680]   January 6.
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:12.840]   And to be fair, I doubt that Matt Gates or Lauren Borbert or Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:14.960]   this letter to Marissa Meyer.
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:18.880]   Some staff, they were writing the same letter to all of the telecom companies.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:23.440]   Some staffer probably didn't realize that Marissa Meyer had left Yahoo.
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:28.200]   And in fact, Yahoo has been sold several times since.
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:33.320]   So it was just a, you know, a bad male merge, not their fault.
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:38.880]   Finally, in good news for humans anyway, a judge has ruled that only humans can get
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:42.760]   patents.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:49.120]   There was an artificial inventor project run out of the University of Surrey, a global
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:53.120]   effort to get a computer listed as an inventor.
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:28:00.800]   They applied for a patent in the United States, but a federal judge ruled that, you know what,
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:06.120]   federal law in the U.S. requires that a, quote, "individual" taken oath that he or she
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:08.400]   is the inventor on a patent application.
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:15.520]   And Judge Leonie Brinkema of Alexandria, Virginia ruled that no AI could take an oath.
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:20.280]   But wait a minute, does that mean that a human who employs AI to develop a product can't
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:21.360]   patent that product?
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:23.360]   The human can.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:24.360]   Yes, the human can.
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:27.760]   The goal of this was to get the patent in the name of the AI.
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:28.760]   Yeah.
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:29.760]   Okay.
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:31.760]   So fun and games until the AI shows up.
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:32.760]   No.
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:33.760]   I know.
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:34.760]   Judge's house isn't demands credit for what it did.
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.880]   Professor, law professor Ryan Abbott who launched this effort says, "We respectfully disagree
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:40.760]   with the judgment and plan to appeal it."
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:42.240]   So we haven't heard the last of it.
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:46.760]   We believe listing an AI as an inventor is consistent with both the language and purpose
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:48.160]   of the patent act.
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:49.160]   Wow.
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:50.160]   AI rights.
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:51.640]   I mean, those robots have a patent.
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:52.640]   Right on to.
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:53.640]   They have a label rights.
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:54.640]   Yeah.
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:55.640]   No AI should ever be forced to wear a sport.
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:57.840]   I'm 100% behind that.
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:28:59.600]   I agree.
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:00.840]   Power to the AI.
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:02.680]   Thank you, Larry Magad.
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:08.000]   Connect safely.org, CBS radio, anything else you want to mention or plug?
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.760]   I go to Larry's world and read some of my Mercury News columns.
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:11.760]   There you go.
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:12.760]   Larry's world.com.
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:13.760]   There you go.
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:14.760]   You got it.
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:15.760]   Thank you, Larry.
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:16.760]   Always a pleasure.
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:17.760]   Always a pleasure.
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:18.760]   Yeah.
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:19.760]   Thanks.
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:21.840]   Alex Cantrowitz, don't forget technology.
[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:26.160]   Bigtechnology.substack.com for the newsletter, the podcast.
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:28.880]   What's always day one about?
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:30.960]   Always day one is my book about the tech giant.
[02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:34.760]   So there's a chapter to reach on Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:41.000]   And it's all about how they are led internally, how their cultures operate and how they use
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.880]   artificial intelligence to make room to invent.
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:46.920]   And it's about their way that they reinvent.
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:49.480]   So they do come in as if it's their first day.
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:53.600]   And if you read the book, you'll find out exactly how they do it.
[02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:59.080]   That was, of course, Jeff Bezos' motto to keep Amazon on its toes is to always act like
[02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:02.120]   it's the first day, always day one.
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:03.120]   Good book.
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:04.120]   Highly recommend.
[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:05.120]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:06.280]   Thank you.
[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:12.560]   Dan Patterson, CBS News, technology editor over there.
[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:14.960]   Anything you would like to mention or plug?
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:17.160]   No, I plugged all the stuff.
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:19.400]   Sorry for talking over everybody.
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:20.400]   Yeah.
[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:25.840]   So that's part of the joy of Zoom conversations, of talk radio.
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:26.840]   Yeah.
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:28.920]   We can't be polite because of latency and so forth.
[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:31.280]   And I think everybody understands that.
[02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:32.280 --> 02:30:33.280]   Excellent.
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:34.280]   No, this is great.
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:37.280]   I'll join you, Larry.
[02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:39.880]   Sorry, Fred, Yapped, Leo, and...
[02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:40.880]   I love Fred.
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:42.880]   Fred, my new favorite dog.
[02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:46.680]   He was a big, the only participant I didn't have any disagreement with.
[02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:51.480]   You guys are great.
[02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:54.280]   Alex, we live very close to each other.
[02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:55.280]   Let's hang.
[02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:59.560]   And Larry, the next time I'm in the bay, I'd love to grab a coffee and...
[02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:00.560]   Talk radio, man.
[02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:02.760]   Yeah, talk radio from Six Feet Apart.
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:03.760]   Bless radio.
[02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:06.560]   All four of us are radio lovers.
[02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:07.560]   Who would have thought that?
[02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:08.560]   Sure.
[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:09.560]   Right?
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:11.280]   We do Twitch, not on the radio.
[02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:12.280]   You know what?
[02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:13.880]   This show is never on the radio.
[02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:16.320]   It's only on your internets.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:21.960]   We do it every Sunday afternoon after I do a radio show, 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2130
[02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:22.960]   UTC.
[02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:24.360]   I mentioned that because you can watch it live.
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:28.200]   If you're one of those people, likes to know that you're watching the same time as we're
[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:29.200]   doing it.
[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:30.960]   Go to twit.tv/live.
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:32.720]   There's live audio and video there.
[02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:37.200]   One of the advantages, one of the reasons we do it live is because we like the live interaction
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:42.560]   from our listeners, both by our chatroom at irc.twit.tv.
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:45.360]   I don't know what that is.
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.240]   What are we seeing there, John?
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:48.240]   There you go.
[02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:49.240]   That's something else.
[02:31:49.240 --> 02:31:50.240]   That's our Discord server.
[02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:59.120]   If you're a member of ClubTwit, Twit.tv/ClubTwit, you can go on in there and post things like...
[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:03.120]   This.
[02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:05.360]   It's the Android Mark Zuckerberg, I guess.
[02:32:05.360 --> 02:32:06.600]   Yes, it looks like Zuckerberg.
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:07.680]   I am sorry.
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:09.880]   That was a big mistake.
[02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:11.560]   It was my mistake.
[02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:18.000]   I am sorry.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.480]   ClubTwit is a lot of fun because of the animated GIFs.
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:28.100]   You can also join the offline chats at our Discord server, which is twit.community, or
[02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:29.100]   twit.social.com.
[02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:30.100]   Our Mastodon server.
[02:32:30.100 --> 02:32:31.100]   Lots of ways to interact.
[02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:34.660]   We appreciate all your thoughts and comments.
[02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:38.560]   In fact, the best thing you could do is subscribe to the podcast and your favorite podcast
[02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:41.140]   client and leave us a five-star review.
[02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:47.020]   Let the world know about one of the longest running, if not the longest running, tech news
[02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:50.280]   podcasts this week in tech.
[02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:51.280]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:52.280]   We'll see you next time.
[02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:59.280]   Another Twit is in the camp.
[02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:05.640]   Bye-bye.
