[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   a very big show today. It's a revision, all revision 3 show.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I'm Leo LaPorte, and joining us for the first time ever,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I don't know how in 145 episodes we've never had him on the show.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jim Lauterbeck, the CEO of Revision 3.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   >> It's great to be, I can't tell you how excited I am to be here.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   It's awesome.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   >> Oh, I apologize profusely for never getting you on.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I don't know how, I don't know what happened.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   But anyway, I think because you're a CEO, I don't want to have a CEO on the show.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   >> I was just living vicariously through Patrick's experience.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   >> Well, what's the excuse for never having me on the show then, Leo?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   >> Not a CEO.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Martin Sargent?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   >> Well, it's Carmine Gallo on a valuable weekend, so you called me.

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   By the way, I want to correct you, Marty.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You have been on Twit before you know you have.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   >> Ah, I know, but I don't think it really counted.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   >> It counted.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   >> I showed up at the podcast expo and I said my piece for about 20 seconds, which was probably
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   one more time than I'll get into this conversation too.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   But it was fun.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   We did it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It was a huge panel.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And I came the wrong week, remember?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I showed up a week before and I was in the parking lot.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's completely empty.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   >> It's really cool.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   >> Down in Ontario.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   >> I'm excited I was to be on Twit.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   >> We drove all the way from LA to Ontario.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   There's nobody there.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I felt for you, Marty.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I really did.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   No, you know, the reason I haven't invited you per se, and that gets so much true of Jim,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   is I try to kind of, it's mostly working press kind of, you know, it's a new tech news stuff.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And by the way, and I get lazy.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   You know, it's a war active, war active, war active.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So John couldn't make it this week.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I thought, what the heck?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Now, in the chat room, by the way, and if you've not watched or Twit Live before, we do this
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   live now at twitlive.tv and we have two chat rooms.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We have a stickam chat room, which is full of people.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's 500 people in there.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And we also have a chat room at irc.dslxtreme.com.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   There is room there.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That chat room is a pound tech live.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And you can join us there next, Arians in that chat room.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He says, wait a minute.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It's not an all revision three show.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You're not revision three, Leo.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And I guess that's true.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So, coming over.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You will be someday.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   We'd like to make an announcement.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   No, I'm not going to make an announcement.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You know what I was really, go ahead.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Can you, I get a, I get a favor to ask for you and Marty.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yes.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I've gotten like 125 emails asking about, quote, the few.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It worked, Marty.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I know we were going to talk about the few.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It worked, Marty.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   It all, it all started.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   There's never been a, I'm going to tell you right now.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   There's never been a few between me and Marty.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   In fact, I adore Marty.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I think you know that, Marty.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yes, Leo.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And maybe a little, maybe a little too much.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But the, what happened is on Twitter, I made a joke.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And it's a, it's a bad old joke.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I've made many times about a restraining order.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And I thought, God, everybody's going to know that's a joke.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Except Marty sends me an email saying, what did you do?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   What did you do?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Put Seagull, poop in my, my food at the ramp.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   What did you do?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   No idea what you're talking about.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   All of a sudden I start getting all these emails.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   There's always message board posts, things about some awful incident that happened at the ramp,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   which caused you to never speak with me again.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I put a restraining order on you.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I didn't know what was going on.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It was a joke.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I took it really personally.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I thought that you and I were always, always BFFs.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Absolutely BS.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And now we are again.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And I'm really looking forward to our cottage that we're going to share up in Mendocino
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   next week.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And I'm glad that we're back together.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Twin beds are double.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Already I get to see that turning red.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   A bear skinned rug in front of the player.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   By the way, guys, if you just had a bad acid flashback, especially you, Jim, I said tech
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   live.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I meant pound, twit live.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Please say something about that, Leo.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And I was like, boy, you're taking an old name.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Please do not confuse the two.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But you call it tech live.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I would have to fire everybody.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You know, tell me if this is true, Jim.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Tech live was really the beginning of the end of tech TV.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I mean, everybody.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   From my potential.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   So what happened is so Paul and bought us World's Worst Investor.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And Paul thinks everybody in the world is just like him.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   So he did that thing.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Remember the voodoo PC, his little handheld PC that ran Vista that cost like $3,000?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Well, he was competing with OQO.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   He wanted to do an OQO.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So he wanted one for himself and built and rather than building three, he built a whole
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   company.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   He only sold three to himself.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Right.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   That's the same thing with the same thing with ZD TV.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Tech TV said, I want a chat.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I want 10 hours a day of tech and financial information on my TV.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So I have something to watch during the day when I'm in the office because obviously
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   you had nothing else to do.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So he funded that.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And then when he decided he didn't, he lost interest.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You're the amazing thing.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Greg Dreben, our Vice President of Programming at the time, told me this much later, he said,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.600]   of course, we spent a million dollars to get tech live running, which was kind of the kiss
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.600]   of death.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.400]   The idea was to do a nine hour news block with a staff that had never done anything more
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.800]   than sunrise semester.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.000]   And they spent, I think, was it, where am I wrong?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Jim, didn't it spend a million dollars on that set close to it?
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.800]   We spent a lot of money on the set.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   I think I must have hired 120, 130 people.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   - Including Carolyn?
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   - Yeah.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   Greg was like, yeah, you want to run it?
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.120]   I'm like, yeah, okay, I've never done anything like this before, but I'm sure going to learn
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   a lot.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.800]   - Has nobody done anything like that before?
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   - Do you think that it was in for tech live, tech TV would still be around?
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   - Probably not.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.400]   - You know what the thing about tech live though was Martin, is it was a distraction.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.800]   You know, when you do anything, there's that, you know, the opportunity cost of not doing
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   something else.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   - Right.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.960]   - And then we didn't do, you know, let's take Leo and put Leo on for eight hours.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.600]   We would have, you know, that would have been there.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   - Well, guess what I'm doing right now?
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   (laughter)
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.960]   Isn't that the funny thing is what comes around?
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   I mean, it's, but anyway, this is what, so I'm having dinner with Greg in New York City.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.800]   And oh, who was the other guy?
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.400]   Oh, Ed, Ed, Badduano, Ed Obed, Padduanna.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   - Yeah, Ed.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   - Cappellano.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   - Cappellano.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   - Cappellano.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   - Love it.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.560]   Who is now, by the way, working in Seattle for Zoom.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.920]   I saw that, that, that cracks me up.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.600]   But he's there as a consultant, I'm sure.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.800]   - No, he's an employee.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   - No.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.240]   - And he's in the creative side, helping the Zoom, whole Zoom thing grow up.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.480]   Yes, and he loves it.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.360]   - Well, no wonder it looks like an acid trip.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.720]   So Ed Cappellano and Greg Dribbon and I are in New York City at one of these, uh, uh,
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.440]   Argentinian sword restaurants, you know, what do they call them?
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.800]   Chiaroscuros, the ones where they skewer the meat.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.920]   And they bring meat on a sword to your table.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.120]   And we're eating there a lot of meat, big time meat.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.240]   And Dribbon says, get this.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   One week into tech live, Paul Allen calls me and says, cancel it.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.020]   One week in, he spent millions of dollars, hired a hundred people, brought people out
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.880]   from the East Coast, promised them, uh, you know, lifetime jobs virtually.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.640]   One week in, Paul Allen says, you know, I don't like it.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.880]   So Dribbon, now, of course, remember Greg, Greg may have, may have been inflating his
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.640]   role here, but he said, no, I talked him down.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.120]   I said, please give us a few months.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.160]   But that's basically all, how long did tech live last?
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.080]   Nine months, 10 months.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.000]   I should have kept all that after the first week.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.680]   Maybe Paul was right.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.280]   It was, it was, it ended up being, and when you looked at the financials, when you looked
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.440]   at the financials for that year, it ended up being not counting the stuff that was hidden
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.840]   in some of the other operating and studio expenses, about a $70 million.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.040]   You're kidding, really?
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.040]   No.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.640]   That was our run rate 50 to a hundred million a year, something like that.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.360]   Yeah, it was.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.120]   We ended up, one of the things that was so expensive about tech live, remember, we set
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.760]   up a studio in Seattle, a studio in the, oh, that's right.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   Fiber line.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.360]   We had Stacy do is, we had people all over the country.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   That's right.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.480]   At fiber line, connecting them together.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.600]   Plus all the, the incredible monthly expenses for the NASDAQ, those NASDAQ, like the NASDAQ,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.280]   Big Board access and all that stuff.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.960]   No, it's, it was a, it was literally Leo, when you looked at it, there was a pig in the
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.600]   snake around all of the expenses that if you looked at it, the financials across four
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.920]   years were a snake, there was a giant pig in the snake that year.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.360]   The irony is here I am sitting in this studio that I put together for just a few thousand
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.960]   dollars streaming live for free over the internet using Skype to do exactly those same kind
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.960]   of satellite things.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.520]   And in fact, it works just as well.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.040]   And you know, I hate to say it, but even with 5,000 people, I may have a bigger audience.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.080]   And probably about the same amount of revenue.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   Exactly.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.120]   Well, the fiber itself is expensive, but you know what?
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.600]   It is very reliable.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.380]   Remember when they made, you know, they turned Silicon spin into Charlie Rose and John de
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.520]   Vorac had to interview everybody over the satellite.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.760]   Yeah, but get this cracked me up.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.920]   Everything was satellite except that if somebody wasn't on the satellite, they put them on
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.560]   a stool in the corner.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.560]   Another one.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   It was the same studio.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.640]   John could see them.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.360]   They were sitting on a stool with a separate camera and background to make it look like.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.080]   And then they wouldn't show the two of them together.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.800]   They put them in a picture in picture.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.280]   So it's like, yeah, via satellite from the other side of the room.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.200]   Hey, man, it's all about maintaining the magic.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   Don't be giving away those secrets.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   I know.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   Well, there's a statue.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   You're going to be using those secrets in your studio.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.360]   Yeah, but I'll admit to it.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.120]   In fact, you know, it'd be really fun is to have a picture and picture of a guy in a stool
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.520]   and then cut to the guy in the stool.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.760]   Just pay up to him.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.760]   Just walk over and say, wait a minute.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.440]   I know you're something's wrong.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.440]   I might do that.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.400]   I didn't mean to turn this into a reminiscing show, but I couldn't help it.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.120]   I really couldn't help it.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.560]   It's so much fun to get you guys on.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.880]   I didn't see any of you guys who detected the 10-year reunion last week.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   Hey, tell us about that.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.560]   Because May 11, 1998 was when we launched.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.480]   I think it was a Dave Chung who got this thing together?
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.080]   Yeah, of course it was Dave Chung.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   He's the Dave Chung.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.080]   Dave Chung really misses.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.080]   It looks like TV.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   He thinks quite a bit, I think.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.280]   Well, he got a lot of free tequila from me.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   Hey, man, it was fun.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.280]   Remember the park side where we used to go?
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   We headed over to the park side.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.560]   Did the tamale lady come by?
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.240]   Tamale lady was not there unfortunately.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.440]   But there's about 50 people there.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.920]   I saw some old friends.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.920]   So yeah, it was kind of nice.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   I'm sorry, I missed that.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.400]   I was doing the show.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.640]   I couldn't, but I got to say I didn't even know about it.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.880]   So the information, you know, you must not have wanted me there.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.880]   You're not on the mailing list.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.360]   You've got to be on the mailing list, Jim.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   I don't even know what the mailing list is.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   You don't want to invite me to the mailing list.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.960]   Chris Perulo has been on the mailing list.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.560]   And actually, I actually, oh, you don't want that.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.360]   I'm for the, you know, that one.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.840]   So it was on my Davis email.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   You're right.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.960]   Yeah, I tried to get you on the show and you said I don't ever look at that email.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.360]   Oh, it's on your Ziff Davis email.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.360]   Oh my God.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.960]   So how long have you now been at a revision three, Jim?
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   It's two years.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   Really?
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.120]   Wow.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.200]   And so your, your title there is CEO.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.800]   That means you're the big hot show.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.840]   Yeah, I have a board that I have to report to, but yeah.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.080]   And does Kevin Rose ever, you know, come over and say, Jim, this tech live thing is not
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.080]   going to work.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.680]   I think we should fire everybody after a week.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.160]   No, Kevin's on the board.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.200]   So Kevin's pretty involved in helping us think about programming and what we do and what
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   we don't do.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.080]   He's, he's portfolio is more dig though, right?
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.320]   I mean, he's yeah.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   I mean, he and Jay, Jay Adelson who started revision three are definitely, you know, they're
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.120]   very much on day because you think about dig.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.960]   What 26, 27 million unique visitors a month, that's in that control.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.560]   No, obviously, you know, they feel like that's, that's, they're knitting.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.560]   They got to stick to that.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.720]   But it's, but I think I know Jay very much believes in IPTV and believes the future and
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.480]   maybe the real future of the company is revision three.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   I do that.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.480]   Absolutely.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   So, uh, did Jay come over and tell you what to do some of those?
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.480]   Well, Jay is chairman of the board.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.080]   So he definitely is, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   it's funny.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080]   I think CEO, oh yeah.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   CEO, you can do whatever you want.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.040]   No, you got this board of five people who beat you up there.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   So, yeah.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.600]   He lives in New York.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   Oh, really?
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600]   He keeps coming out here when you're out here about once a month.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.040]   Oh, I thought he was that more often.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.040]   He's out here.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.680]   He's out here two weeks a month.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   Martin's in his shed.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   He doesn't know.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.040]   Martin misses all the visits from the big weeks.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040]   Who else is on the board?
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   Jim.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.560]   Uh, it's two of the guys from Graylock, David Z and James Slavitt.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.600]   Graylock put $8 million adventure funding into the company.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.400]   And what are you doing with all that money?
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.920]   Um, spending it on Martin's salary and Patreuse.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   Building a studio.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   Um, I went into the shed.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.120]   It's a, we're, we're doing it to expand beyond, basically, I mean, that's a flip answer, but
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.560]   basically to expand beyond dignity and, uh, a couple of the other shows that we had when
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.560]   the money came in.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.520]   So, so dignity is revision three and it's currently the big show on revision three.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   Actually, that's not really true.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:43.840]   Um, dignity, if you look at, uh, number of videos delivered per month, Texilla, Patrick's
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.600]   show, Patrick and Veronica has surpassed dignity.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   Congratulations.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   Thank you.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   That's awesome.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.800]   I'm not surprised.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   That's fantastic.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   I'm really glad to hear that.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.640]   And where's internet superstar fall into that, Jim?
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.200]   Um, internet superstar is among a couple of shows that we've launched that are our, um,
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   rising stars.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.480]   So what we're doing with those shows and rising stars and like that.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   I like that.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.440]   And, uh, building an audience for them.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.720]   So it's like, I, I got an MBA.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   So I'll do some boring, uh, financial stuff.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.160]   And it's, it's portfolio analysis.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   You have, you have your, your company, your shows that are really big and that are drawing
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.240]   a real big audience.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.320]   And then you have your shows that have great potential and you watch them and share them.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.880]   And at some point they either break through and become really big or you say, well, maybe
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.880]   this isn't working.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.680]   Let's, let's think about reworking this or trying something different.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.600]   I've never, I've never been able to cancel a single show.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.600]   See, that's my problem.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   You're all my babies.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   You got it.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.920]   You got to eat your dead.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.800]   I can't do it.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.880]   But no, like Martin's show web drifter was huge, but again, like you said, you can't do
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   it every week.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.000]   So that's why it makes a lot of sense to bring it back in the fall for a second running.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Right.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Right.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.200]   So let's talk, let's start talking now about the big story of the week, which is frankly
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:59.440]   about revision three and it was the amazing story of the denial of service attack.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.960]   And I first became aware of this Patrick when you tweeted on Twitter, help.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.040]   We need a network expert.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   We're being, we're being de-dossed.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.920]   Is that what I said?
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   Something like that.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.920]   I'll have to go back and look at the archives, but it was something like that.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.360]   Well, no, we were looking for somebody at, we were looking for somebody at a specific
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:24.080]   DNS routing facility to see if, if anybody happened to have a contact there.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.480]   So this must have been very early on before you had any idea what was going on.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.760]   Actually, Roger Chang couldn't log into, we couldn't access a bunch of services.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.680]   And Roger emailed me about that on my personal account.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.080]   So I had the home addresses for a couple of the people and emailed them and it went from,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.680]   oh, that's weird to, oh, something seems to be weird with our DNS to, oh my God.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   Right.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.680]   Right.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   Well, I have it actually right here.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.800]   I've, I'll put it up for you so you can see it.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.320]   It says revision three is under a major de-doss attack repost for Jeff Rizzo.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.680]   Anyone knows something at United layer who's asked, I can kick it to helping us.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.840]   That's the exact phrase.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.240]   I mean, so it started happening on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, which, you know,
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.000]   everybody was gone.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.440]   Oh, it always is that way.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.120]   So it was a week ago, it was last Saturday.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120]   Last Saturday.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.880]   And what, and what was, what was happening?
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.080]   So there are a certain type of packet called a SIN packet when you want to, when one machine
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.720]   on the internet wants to connect to another, they send this short little message and send
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   it out.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.480]   And the other machine that you're trying to contact sends an act back and acknowledge
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.680]   back.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.240]   And if that connection happens and they open up a connection and they communicate and send
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.640]   bigger packets with more information, there were a bunch of computers out there on the
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.000]   net that were just flooding us with these SIN packets.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.040]   And we were getting about 8,000 an hour.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.880]   It wasn't a huge amount of bandwidth, but our network infrastructure just as, was unable
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.000]   to deal with 8,000 of those an hour.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   That's enough.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   8,000.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Not a minute.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Now I've seen 8,000 a minute.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   So it was 8,000 an hour.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Oh, I was second.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Second.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Okay.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   I was going to say 8,000 an hour.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I could, that's not too bad.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   No, 8,000 a second.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.720]   So what's the, so you, this is a traditional SIN flood.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.520]   It's exactly what brought down Yahoo five, six years ago.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.480]   Normally what you would do if it's coming from the same IP addresses block it.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.840]   So obviously this is coming from a variety of IP addresses.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.720]   Yeah, there are a wide range of different IP addresses, but as it turns out, we track
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   them all back to a single company.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.760]   Now tell us about that.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.000]   So we tracked it back to this company, ArtistDirect.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.880]   And so we knew that they were coming from there.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.880]   We knew what they were.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.520]   All of them were coming from the same company.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.600]   Well, about 90%.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   And we, so about 7,000 a second.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.280]   And we knew that, we knew that through their ISP was.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.400]   So we tried to get these guys on the phone, but it was a Memorial Day weekend and nobody
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   called us back.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   Right.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.480]   So you say in your, in your article, but by the way, I highly recommend people read this.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.440]   It was on the revision three blog.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.920]   You say that it in effect they, this company not only didn't hide as, as you would normally
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.680]   hide it with a DDoS attack, they didn't hide the source.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   They announced it.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.840]   They said, Hey, look at us.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.840]   We're attacking you.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.480]   Well, yeah, they didn't spoof the, usually you spoof the IP address that it comes from.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.920]   You know, you don't want people to know, or, you know, you have some shadowy IP address
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.640]   from Romania or something with these guys like, they want, they just, you just looked
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.480]   it up and it was right there on the table and it was a artist or act.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.320]   Well, who's behind artist direct?
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.840]   So by the time we eventually got to their ISP, we found out that the machines were, it
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.720]   was a division of artist direct called media defender.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.560]   And this is where the plot thickens, as they say, because media defender, their job is
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.320]   to, they work with large copyright holders like the Warner Brothers and, you know, people
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.960]   who have do movies and what they do is they protect their copyrights basically on torrent
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.280]   based networks by, well, they're basically creating spoof files.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.680]   So imagine you got the Indiana Jones movie, right?
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.840]   And then somebody creates a torrent of it and it's out there.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.440]   They'll create a thousand versions of the Indiana Jones movie, but, and put them and
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.000]   see them through the torrent network, but they're all just full of garbage.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.680]   So in effect, you're trying to get Indiana Jones, what you get is a seed that's worthless.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   Right exactly.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.480]   It's kind of looking for the needle in the haystack at that point.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.400]   So their job is to use these aggressive means to promote copyright holders.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.040]   And one of the tricks in their arsenal, as I found when I did some research, I was looking
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.440]   at a story from Ars Technica, was that, you know, they also include denial of service
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:41.040]   attacks as one of the weapons in their cache of weapons that they go after people who are
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   violating copyrights.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.800]   They say on their webpage, we use a range of noninvasive technological countermeasures
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.280]   like decoy and spoofing.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.040]   They have a leak alert service.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.640]   They don't mention the fact that they might be doing DOS attacks.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.240]   I mean, that was in the Ars Technica story.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.280]   There was another, another group that really was got mad at them at one point and tried
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.000]   to shut them down or do something.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.320]   And apparently they put a denial of service attack out against them too.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:15.160]   So these sort of sin flood denial of service attacks are not unknown by this company.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.760]   So here's what happened was we, we had a torrent tracker.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.680]   A torrent tracker is basically a way to figure out who's got copies of torrent files and
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.960]   how you kind of find your torrent file out there in the ecosystem.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.840]   We post all of our shows via BitTorrent.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.520]   We have been since Kevin started the company with System back in 2011.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.800]   We used to do that too.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.680]   So, you know, and we've been doing it for a long time.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.160]   They apparently have been using our tracker often on when it's been available to put their
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   spoofs out.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.680]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.960]   So they, they have to use people's BitTorrent track is to do the spoofing.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.400]   And you're saying they used yours?
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.640]   They don't have to.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.800]   They take advantage of open tracking system.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.320]   Whoa, they don't have to.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.600]   And I'm certain they host their own tracking systems to basically.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.680]   Yeah, but if people, but if people, and it starts to say, Oh, well, hey, if it comes
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.000]   from these IP addresses, is media defender, ignore it?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.840]   They need to use other open tracking systems.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   I can see that.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   Exactly.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:21.800]   So our tracker, you know, and I look back into this, our real network head guy started
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.440]   in April of 2006.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:30.520]   And from April 2006 to April 2007, our tracker server was had a whitelist.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.240]   Basically it wouldn't respond unless you were asking for one of our shows, you know, at
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.360]   the hat, the file hash that was one of the hashes that it knew about.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   Right.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.080]   Server had been crashing all over the place.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.320]   So we moved over to another.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.280]   We were using the BitTorrent server written in Python.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.720]   But basically couldn't handle whitelist over about 1000 or so.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.720]   We got that many and more.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.540]   So moved over to another piece of software and to try and see if it would be stable, we
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.460]   left it open.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.000]   So we did that level.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.160]   So that was for about five weeks.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.320]   So what that meant is that since we'd had a tracker for a long time, the name of our
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.440]   tracker was out there.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.960]   And as people created torrents over time, it was it, it became one of the 40 or so that
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.880]   you can put into a torrent file.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.840]   And a lot of people used it, even though it wasn't responding, it was on that list of
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.760]   torrent of trackers at one point that you could use.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.600]   So once we opened it back up again, our index started really, and we unknown to us, our
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.480]   index started growing and we had lots and lots of torrents that we were tracking.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.200]   Not just from media to Fender, but from a lot of other people I would imagine.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   Other people too.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   And this is like a search engine.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   So basically we were, you know, tracking.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.720]   You didn't have bad, you didn't have bad stuff on there, but just like pyruve, we would
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.560]   have had links to torrents.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.800]   We were linking to things and showing where you could find it and what PCs were hosting
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   it and things like that.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.440]   Presumably this is something you'd, if you'd known about, you wouldn't have wanted to
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.440]   have one.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.480]   It was not, it's certainly not something that we as a company would want to do.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480]   Right.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.880]   And it turns out a guy in our forums noticed it and, and put a forum message up and said,
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.640]   guys, did you know that your tracker's open now?
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.840]   And my CTO was on vacation for two weeks in Italy.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.840]   When was that?
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   He said that.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.680]   And it was sometime like sort of like two weeks ago or a week and a half ago.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.680]   Okay.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.720]   We opened it up the first week of April and it was probably sometime in mid May or, or,
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.040]   or, and so the minute that my CTO got back, like the next day, which was the Saturday of
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.440]   Memorial Day weekend, he, we put the whitelist back in effect.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.680]   Right after we put that whitelist in, we started getting the sin flood and we thought
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.240]   it was a bunch of, you know, rogue, poor at folks from some shadowy Eastern European
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   countries.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.160]   It was like, you know, some sort of pissed at us.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.880]   Turns out, no, it was this legit business media defender that, and I think they just
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.560]   couldn't conceive of the fact that somebody would use BitTorrent for legitimate reasons.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.400]   And the minute that we shut ourselves down to them, as far as I tell, it appears, they
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.960]   just flooded us with sympathy.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:04.760]   Now they claimed that you had 296,000 illegal.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.760]   What do they call them?
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   Seeds.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.880]   You weren't holding the files, but you had the, the meta files for those.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   Well, we had that.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.760]   What the tracker does is it tracks which computers actually hold at files.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:22.120]   So, um, and I, over time, um, you know, since we've been running a torrent tracker since
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.080]   I'm sure 2005 or 2006, I'm sure it was open for a long time.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.200]   It doesn't take long to fill it up with that.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.000]   So that, oh, so you don't contest that.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.400]   Well, I mean, I don't know that probably not.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.720]   I mean, it's, uh, the thing about it is though a torrent file.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.920]   So the way torrents work is you have a torrent file that the dot torrent contains the hash
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.480]   file of the file, the hash, the unique identifier of it.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.560]   And then it contains a list of tracking servers up to 40 tracking servers.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.360]   When you create a torrent, you can actually put anything in there you want.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.240]   Like I could put, you know, I could put tracker dot quit dot TV in there if I wanted to.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   Right.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.400]   So I don't run bit torrent trackers anymore, by the way.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.120]   But you can put, you know, tracker dot white house dot gov if you wanted to.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.280]   Some of the software will actually go out and check and see if the tracker is online.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   Right.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.000]   And we'll include a list of ones that were known at one point.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.160]   So I fully think and, you know, this is, I'm just conjecturing at this point because prior
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.960]   to April of 2006, it was basically three guys in an apartment in LA and nobody really remembers
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.960]   anything.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:41.800]   Because they were, you know, I literally don't remember anything.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.560]   So Martin, you were probably there once in a while too.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.560]   I was there.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.760]   I stopped by for a couple of, a couple of parties.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   Yeah, I don't remember.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   I might have.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   I don't remember.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.000]   But I think this should happen to us like once a month.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.600]   We've got a tremendous amount of press out of it.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.800]   It's been very good for.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:04.920]   So media defenders says, hey, these guys have illegal torrent files on, not again, as you
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:10.120]   said, Jim, not the file itself, but just the metadata, the torrent dot torrent file, just
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   like Pirate Bay.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.360]   No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
