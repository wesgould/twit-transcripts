[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   which is not my favorite aspect of the whole teething thing.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   >> Has he said any words yet?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   >> Oh, he's been talking for like almost, I don't know, five,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   six, eight months.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   >> Are you teaching a marketing speak?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   >> Oh, no.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Teaching them entirely different.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> Oh, dear.

[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   >> Host of the -- of the core on PS3.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   >> Q-O-R-E.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   All three of you --
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> Yes, thank you for having me.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> Active Twitters, Veronica -- are you -- you're ver -- just

[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> I am.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I was lucky enough to grab just Veronica back in the day.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   >> Wow, that's pretty good.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> LaVar is LaVar Burton.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> I wanted Veronica, but it was taken.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   See, a lot of us felt that way.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And, of course, Patrick is -- are you --
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> Patrick Norton.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   >> Just Patrick Norton.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You're not the real Patrick Norton.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> No, I'm Patrick Norton.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   >> Also with us in studio today, Brian Shaler, who is the guy who
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   jumps.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I'm not a monkey.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   He who jumps.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I don't know if you've seen his pictures on the interwebs, but
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   he is famous for his jump.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   In fact, there's a -- the Flickr tag, Shaler Jump.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> Yes.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   >> There is.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> You could just go to --
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   >> Yeah, and it's such a great thing to be known for.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Like, oh, wow, he's such an accomplished guy.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He jumps.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> He jumps for a living.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Isn't he cool?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> He's going to jumping and flailing and looking like an
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   idiot.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That's all be his fan.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   >> Thanks for being here.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   >> Love to be here.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   >> Brian currently is employed by a company called BitGravity,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   about which more later.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Also with me, Chris in studio, Chris Hutchins.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Chris has a lot of time on his hands.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   He's the creator of Laid-Off Camp.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   >> Yep.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   We launched our first event on Tuesday in San Francisco, and
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   over 500 people talking about how to better their laid-off time.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> Isn't that wild?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   That's great.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   >> So I guess you're looking for -- you hope for less people to
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   show up.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> Oh, that's a good point.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   >> Yeah, it's going to say, I don't know if -- I mean, not to
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   take anything away from the effort, but we'd all rather have
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   happily employed in searching for better jobs camp or health
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Although Leo and I were discussing the future of work and how we
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   might use Laid-Off Camp to --
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   >> It's kind of an opportunity to say --
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   >> It's not going to --
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> It's not going to --

[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   >> -- it's going to be --
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   >> -- it's going to be --
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   >> -- it's going to be --
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   >> -- it's going to be --
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   >> -- it's going to be --
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   >> -- it's going to be --
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   >> -- it's going to be --
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   >> -- it's going to be --
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   >> -- you know, now they say
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   we just closed this.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Here's -- I'm looking at the
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   data rate plans.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And here's how they disclose it.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It's $60 a month for 5 gigabytes.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And then after 5 gigabytes,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   it's an additional .0048 per kilobyte.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   >> Mm.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   >> Well, that doesn't sound like
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   much, right?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   What is that?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   There's a lot of zeros in there.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   That's pretty cheap.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   That's, you know, nothing.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   But it adds up to considerably
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   more.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   I think it's 48 cents a megabyte.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And it doesn't take long
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   before you're up to $5,000.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Her point is, yeah, they might
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   have disclosed it.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   She says they didn't tell me.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   >> Yeah, very small prep.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   >> 18C says it's right there.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   You see that .0048 cents?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   It's right there.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I got to tell you, I don't
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   think that's disclosure.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   She's sewing them.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   >> I got to wonder, what was
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   the woman using all of --
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   >> -- hollos.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   >> She was watching hollos, of
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   course.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   >> Well, if you watch
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   High Definition Video, or if you
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   start downloading and selling
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   applications, I mean, if you
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   watch -- we actually went through
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   it on Tekzilla two weeks ago, where
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   we actually went, this is the data
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   rate for something like Hulu
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   regular versus Hulu HD.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   This is what happens if you start
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   downloading movies from Netflix or
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Amazon.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And it can add up, you know, it
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   doesn't take a lot of work to get
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   to 10 or 20 gigabytes.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   >> So it turns out maybe she was
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   watching Twitly, huh?
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   >> So, somebody who streams a lot
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   of data, I can see these -- you
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   know, five gigabytes sounds like
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   a lot, and it is if you're just
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   looking at email.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   >> You know, five gigabytes is,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   you know, three and a half
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   movies.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   >> Right.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   >> You know, it's nothing.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   >> You know, near HD movies from
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   almost any of the online services.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   >> Nothing.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   >> Well, people were getting
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   upset about Comcast, and that's
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   250 gigabytes.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I mean, five seems just like you
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   could hit it in a day.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   >> Right.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   >> Yeah, and all of the -- all of the
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   the -- the -- the -- the -- the
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   -- the -- the -- the -- the
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   the -- the -- the -- the -- the
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   eVDO providers now have a five
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   gigabyte cap.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Sprint was the last -- Sprint was
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   the only one that really had an
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   unlimited cap any time recently.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   >> I think it's good.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   They should be a little more maybe
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   forthcoming with the overages
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   charges, but at the same time,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   people have to be kind of
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   informed about how all this stuff
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   plays out.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Because if you're just not
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   reading the small text or not
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   paying attention enough to what
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   the terms say, then you're just
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   going to get in trouble.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   There's no two ways about it.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Like, you have to figure that
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   stuff out before you start
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   downloading films and -- and
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   movies and all sorts of other
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   stuff over eVDO.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   >> I've got to check because I -- you
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   know, I have a Verizon card and
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   they didn't use to charge.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   They just would say at five
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   gigabytes, we're going to cut you
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   off.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   And now they charge and they
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   charge a pretty high rate.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   >> Now which would you rather
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   have -- would you rather have if
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   they cut you off if you're
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   wrapped -- charge you?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   >> You don't want to get a $5,000
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   bill.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   >> Right.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   >> And you really can't -- what are
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   you going to say?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   I mean, she's suing, but she -- it's
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   not a slam dunk by any means.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   You know, AT&T saying, well, we
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   told you.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   You know, it's all very clearly
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   disclaimed.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   >> Well, one thing that I think is
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   a bad play for them PR-wise is
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   when these people get slammed for
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   $5,000 or $10,000, they're not
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   being told that they're about to
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   go over that they have gone
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   over.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   They find out when they get the
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   next bill.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   >> You need to let me know.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   >> Call you up and say, you know, at
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   this rate, tomorrow you're going to
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   be over.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   >> I know it's kind of a
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   different thing, but with like
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   PG&E, for example, I do auto pay
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   every month, and if for some reason
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   my bill goes over $100, which it
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   almost never does, they tell me,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   they let me know that this is
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   happening before they charge my
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   account.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   It would be better if companies
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   like AT&T and other EVDO
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   providers could definitely have
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   something like that.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   I mean, that would be --
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   >> Well, they should.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   >> Nice.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   >> You can check.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   You can check.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   They say there's a tool on the
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   computer that you could see I'm
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   going to use, but it doesn't
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   flash a sign up.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   >> But I had Verizon before I
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   had an iPhone, and I got a
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   text message at one point in time,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   and I don't remember frequently
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   saying I'm out of minutes for
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   the month.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   >> That's nice.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   >> So they have that feature
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   set up some ability.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   >> They have the capability.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   >> It's not as clean cut with an
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   EVDO modem or a tethering device
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   as it is with a cell phone
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   usage.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   You know, but I mean, they can
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   send into an email account, but
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   it's not like they can actually
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   have the EVDO modem show on
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   the personal screen like what's
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   going on.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   >> If you watched us all -- not
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   even all day.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   If you watch this eight hours a
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   day, five days a week, it would
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   be, you know, a terabyte a
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   month.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   It would be a -- 500 megabytes
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   a month.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   It would be a gigabyte a
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   month.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   It would be a lot of data.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And if you then down it, if you
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   podcast, watch a little daily
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   show on Hulu, I mean, it
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   wouldn't be hard to get up.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   You're not going to get to
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   250 gigabytes maybe, but --
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   >> Unless you're really avid --
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   >> Yeah, Twitter, right.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   140 characters at a time.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   >> Oh, I thought you were saying
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   watching Twits.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   >> No, that's right.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   >> Don't confuse Twitter.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   >> No, no.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   >> I thought you said watching
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Twitter.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   >> No, you're actually -- I
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   should do the calculations.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Because we -- it's 500 kilobits a
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   second.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   So I can -- you know what?
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   >> Oh, like --
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   >> Or Patrick's fell right over.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   >> 60 kilobytes a second.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   >> That wasn't me.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   >> That was -- that was -- that
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   was at my house.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   >> That was your --
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   >> I'm actually outside this
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   afternoon.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   And we had a huge gust of wind
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   that blew over the umbrella.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   >> Oh, you're outside on the
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   pool and the porch with the
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   umbrella.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   >> I thought he was living it up.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   >> Now I'm in California.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   >> Now I'm in California.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   >> We didn't get video of this
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   show.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Now I am sad.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   >> I told you we went to great
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   links to set it up for you here,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Leo.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   >> Oh, thank you.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   I'm sorry, Lavar.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   We'll do it next time.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   >> Next time, next time.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   >> About 200 megs an hour.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   >> Yeah, 176 gigabytes a month
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   if you watch 24/7.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   So even then, it'd be hard to
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   get to that 250.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   >> Easy to go past five.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   >> True deal.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   >> I mean, it's interesting because
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   the five gigabyte cap, you know,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I want to say AT&T had one Verizon
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   put one in place.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Sprint finally followed up in
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   -- Sprint finally followed up in
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   November of 2008.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   And it's -- you got to wonder what
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   was the motivation, you know,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   where people -- because I suspect
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   people were dropping -- people
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   were dropping other accounts or
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   satellite Internet to be able to
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   use the eB --
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   >> That's why AT&T won't let you
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   tether or they wouldn't let Apple
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   sell that tethering application.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   You have to pay extra to tether
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   your iPhone.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   >> Oh, they introduced --
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   >> They are going to introduce
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   a plan, but it will cost you
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   extra.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   >> Oh, of course.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   >> Unless you were one of the
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   lucky people that downloaded that
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   tethering application within the
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   first 12 hours and if you were
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   going to have a copy of the
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   -- >> Think that the application
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   downloaded through the store
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   can be disabled.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   But they haven't disabled it,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   oddly enough.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   >> Well, with the new App Store,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   you know, the third-party
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   App Store that are coming up like

[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   you know, the other day, you know, the other day,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   you know, the other day, you know, the other day,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   you know, the other day, you know, the other day,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   you know, the other day, you know, the other day,
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   you know, the other day, you know, the other day,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   you know, the other day, you know, the other day,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Judge, you know, Judge J. Thomas Martin said,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   go right ahead, you may tweet
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   from the control room,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   the courtroom, he says he's
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   recounted testimony and offered courtroom color,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   including, quote, "Judge Martin is talking to
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   reluctant witness in chambers with a court reporter
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   transcribing the conversation," or,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   quote, "The witness who is yelling in the hallway
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   early has not returned to the courthouse."
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   It's actually an interesting idea, I think.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Much more functional than the guy who tweeted his
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   wedding.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Yeah, that's pathetic. That's just pathetic.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   But, you know, I always hated those sketches
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   that you do, you know, with the court.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Oh, I love them.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   You like those, but they're always so awful.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   That's why they're hilarious.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I would like to have, like, ten of them and just
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   frame them and put them up in my office.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Oh, right. Why doesn't anyone have a face?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   I'm like famous people on a trial.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   They're like caricatures, basically.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   That would be fun.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   I met the artist who did a lot of the O.J. Simpson trial.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Really?
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Yeah, he was a storyboard artist.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   I used him for a commercial that I created last year.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   The man is an incredible artist, and he promised me
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   an original Lance Edo, Judge Lance Edo.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Oh, my God, that would be so awesome.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Absolutely.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   All right, I'll tell you that.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Yeah, you change your tone.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   I take it back.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   No, now I'm thinking.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   That's history right there on the wall.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Right.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Like the ones with Michael Jackson and stuff are so cool
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   and, like, creepy-looking, they'd be perfect.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   They don't really look like anything, but it would still be fun to have.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Are you going to go to his comeback tour?
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   You have to go to London, right?
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   But it's a little weird.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   He said, "This is the last time I'm playing London."
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   You didn't, like, say I'm retiring.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   He said, "I'm not going to be here again."
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   So, by two-lay a lot of tunes in the hoo.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   We might be retiring this time, for sure.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Very non-committal.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   This is the last time I'll be playing here for the next two years.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   [laughter]
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   I went to see the Stones the last time I went to town.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   I just think it's amazing that this guy, I mean, this is an old guy like me hope.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   It's kind of '60s, is dancing and shaking, and he's got, you know, the lips and the thing,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   and he's doing the whole thing.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   It's amazing.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   And, of course, Ron would look, and, well, Keith Richards looks like he's been dead for 20 years,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   but I think he needs--
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Yeah, but he's looked like that for more than more.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   He's always looked like that, right?
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Hey, as long as they can keep doing what they love and they're doing a good job,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   they're having a really faint money for it.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   God bless them.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   They're happy.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Good on them.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   [laughter]
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Let's see, what else here?
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Did you see, we were talking about this before we started.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   I don't think we talked about it on the show.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Wolfram, who's famous for Mathematica, is creating a new website that will allow you,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   I guess, kind of an artificial intelligence site, to ask any question, it will give you
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   any factual answer to any question you ask.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Steve Wolfram is a genius, some say.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   What do you think, Patrick?
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   I think it's kind of a cool idea.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Do you think he can do it as the question?
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Well, yeah, I mean, the thing that kind of fascinated me was sort of those things that
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   first burbled up in the blogosphere and then that's up on slash dot and tech crunch.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   He's saying he has an initial version of a computer that answers factual questions.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Wow.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Allah, and I quote, "Star Trek Ship Computers" from an anonymous poster on slash dot.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.200]   It's web-based application, Wolfram Alpha, and it's a really interesting idea that it's
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:39.680]   going to respond, rather than a link of web pages, it's going to give you an actual answer.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:44.680]   He says, "It's not Google.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.680]   They're hand-entering all the data."
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   This is more like pseudo-turing stuff.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   That's what I want to know is, is it actually doing this?
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   They're calling it a computational knowledge engine.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   It's really interesting.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:05.080]   It's going to open in May, and it's a really interesting idea because Wolfram's not talking
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:09.080]   a whole lot about it yet.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   They're saying, "You ask it a question and it will compute an answer for you."
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.760]   Somebody said, "Well, what about biases?"
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.040]   You can say, "Well, it's only going to answer factual questions.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   What was Apple's stock price on January 20, 2000?"
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:31.600]   You might ask it about things that are more controversial, like climate change and certainly
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:37.160]   whatever there's some biases, and they're in the data that's been entered in there.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:43.160]   Because people entering in answers to questions that may or may not be posed to this service.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.320]   I don't think it's exactly that.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.800]   Apparently, they've been doing it for some time in stealth mode, like years.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   But here's the thing.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:59.320]   If you've got a database that has been entered into, the input has been handled by human beings,
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.680]   then there's going to be a bias.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.400]   It's only a matter of how long it takes you to determine what the bias is.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.400]   This would be a good time to have Calcannas on, because you can't talk about it.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   Mahalo!
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.400]   Yeah, Mahalo's human.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   Right.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.200]   Yeah, but this isn't human.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:23.440]   What this is is the idea that they got the engineering on and they broke down.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.120]   These are the types of factual questions there are.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:31.520]   These are different models that are computational models for answering these questions.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.640]   What they manually entered or automatically pulled in, and I'm quoting from the TechCrunch
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.600]   article here, is masses of raw factual data about various fields of knowledge.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.200]   But then they have to connect it somehow, right?
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   Sure.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.000]   Well, it has to be able to interpret the question.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   And then it should have been a question in English.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.400]   And you can ask one question about Apple's stock price on whatever day.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:57.000]   You can ask that question in many different ways.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.480]   Maybe not that one specifically, but there are a lot of questions that it takes a lot
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:06.240]   of artificial intelligence to be able to decrypt the English language to see what they're
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   trying to ask.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.040]   But can it answer how is Babbie formed?
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.520]   I know, but we can.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.120]   We know the answer.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.040]   Well, you can kind of do that in Google.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.920]   I'm going to type, "What is the capital of California in Google?"
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.480]   I remember this kind of coming out and being talked about a while ago.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:28.440]   I think it was when Live Search was just starting, they were transitioning to the Live brand.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.360]   Microsoft was or MSN was.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.680]   And one of the awesome new features that makes it so much cooler than Google is that, and
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.040]   they had this as an example, "What does an alligator eat?"
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   You could type that in and it would talk about the diet of an alligator, I think, in
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.040]   Live Search.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.240]   And that was two plus years ago.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.560]   I don't know how they were entering the--
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.520]   You remember Power Set that did that using Wikipedia and was attempting to do the same
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.520]   thing?
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.520]   Didn't do it very well.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.520]   But this is kind of the difference between--
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.040]   By the way, the American alligator feeds on a variety of animals.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.520]   They will eat almost any prey.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.520]   So there you go.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.520]   It's Google.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.520]   Right.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.520]   But that means that's not answering the question.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.520]   That is actually giving you a search result and it happens to be answered in that snippet.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.280]   Google does do direct answers to certain questions.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   Sometimes.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:15.160]   If you give a mathematical question or a computation of some kind, it will give you that answer.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.160]   If you ask a capital--
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.840]   Today, because of Daylight Savings Time, I typed in "current time" into Google and it
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.000]   told me different cities and what hybrid is there.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.400]   That's very neat.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.160]   It also knows where I am, so it gave me my time.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.160]   It assumes.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.160]   But it also gives you a lot of other cities.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.240]   Once you start indexing all the world's information, you have some answers for people.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.240]   It's pretty good.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   It would help necessarily.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.360]   Because information is not knowledge and it's not necessarily an answer.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.880]   It empowers them to create tools to do answers.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:45.080]   Is Wolfram trying to do knowledge?
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.520]   Wolfram, in a way it is.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.720]   Wolfram is trying to do is build a machine that can do a fifth graders essay.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.760]   There's a difference between listing sources.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.880]   In actually giving you this is the answer.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.320]   It's an interesting concept.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.760]   An essay implies a point of view.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.640]   That's why I said a fifth graders essay.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.400]   Remember, remember that you have to start with a topic sentence.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:16.000]   It was like, what is your report as a fifth grader?
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.840]   I'm writing about the zebra.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:18.840]   The zebra has a point.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.640]   I wrote an excellent report on Black Bears one time.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   Really?
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   Let's hear it.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   Do you remember it?
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:28.960]   If I remember correctly, the female Black Bear weighs 300 pounds and the male Black Bear
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.520]   weighs 500 pounds.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.520]   Never mind.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.320]   You'll never forget those important things you learned in that report.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:40.080]   I think I now understand why in the chat earlier people were saying, "Baronica."
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.080]   Bear on the sea?
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.080]   I'm an expert on bear.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.280]   A little known fact.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   We're going to come back.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:52.120]   Melinda Gates, apparently, living a life of horror.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.960]   The kids are not allowed to own iPhones or iPods.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:01.880]   She reveals to Vogue a response from Funny or Die coming up in just a little bit before
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:02.880]   we...
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.840]   Yes, it's called a tease.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:12.000]   Before we do that, I want to tell you about GoToMyPC.com/twitlesetchup with a 30-day free
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.640]   trial of this amazing remote access software.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   Colleen's on me.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.120]   She says, "If you're going to tell everybody who's going to MyPC, you've got to start
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   using it on the TriCaster."
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.760]   Okay, I'm going to start using...
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:29.080]   I'm going to be able to control the TriCaster from my home.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.200]   I don't know what's going to happen, folks.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.440]   It's going to be interesting.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.960]   The idea is, "Okay, I could do it right now.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.960]   You could do it along with me.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.160]   Just go to GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.160]   Go on the TriCaster.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.880]   I install GoToMyPC.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:46.680]   Now anywhere I go, whether in Internet Cafe, buy the pool at an airport at a hotel, I log
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.320]   on to GoToMyPC.com.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.400]   I'm using my own username and password.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:57.040]   I get 128-bit encrypted connection right to here, and I can control the video.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.960]   I can do anything I could do on a run any program, send and receive email, access any
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.480]   network resource remotely, securely.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.280]   PCWorld said, "This is the best.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.760]   You've tried the rest.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   Now try the best."
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:14.760]   The remote access software, they gave their world-class award to many years in a row.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.760]   I could tell you, I've tried them all.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:21.120]   This is the easiest, the most secure, the fastest.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.760]   It's just like you there.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:30.240]   And now you can try it quickly and easily by going to GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   This is from the folks at Citrix.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.240]   I know them well.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   I've known them for many years.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.640]   Used to hang out with Ed Ya Khabuchi down at CES and Comdex.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.320]   These guys, they wrote the guts of Windows.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:45.400]   Even Microsoft uses their code for its remote access, but this is better.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.800]   This is the good stuff.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   Go to myPC.com/twit.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   Give it a try.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.800]   I know you'll like it.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.160]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.280]   Have you guys seen the Bill Gates Funny or Die bit?
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.240]   I thought you were just going to start a conversation about that article.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.600]   I was like, "Oh, yay, more Apple fanboys."
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.960]   But I'm eager to see this funny or anything.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.880]   No, it's not really.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.200]   It's not really Melinda.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   You understand that?
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.200]   I have seen it.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.520]   Well, yeah, I heard about the story.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.920]   I didn't know that there was a Funny or Die sketch based on that.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:17.560]   So the story, just to recap, is Melinda's talking, I think it's Devogue and says, "Yeah,
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.800]   I mean, she's fine about it."
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   She says, "No."
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.160]   And Steve Bombers, same thing.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.480]   He says, "I wouldn't let my kids touch an iPod."
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.080]   I guess that's loyalty.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.120]   I mean, I guess.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.080]   Yes.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.400]   It seems like a pretty tough stance.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.440]   This is Bill Gates' wife Melinda.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.840]   This is an actress portraying there.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.120]   I just have to explain that for Funny or Die.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.520]   Look, if Bill finds out I'm using this iMac, he'll freak out.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.640]   I told you in a little magazine that we don't have any Mac products in the house, but you
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.640]   know what?
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.640]   I lied.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:49.640]   Okay?
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   I have to.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.920]   A couple of months back, he'll found out I had an iPhone and an iPod and seven iMacs.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   And he lost.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   Oh my God.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.840]   You wouldn't believe he freaked out.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   But you know what?
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:00.840]   Give me a break.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.840]   Come on.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.080]   We're bazillionaires here.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.080]   And Bill has me and the kids living like we're cave people.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.360]   It's a nightmare.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.360]   Like last Christmas, okay?
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:14.160]   I tried to put together a family photo album using this crap program.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:18.760]   Dell mega picture video storage library or something like that.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:19.760]   It was awful.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.760]   It was hard.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.760]   It took forever.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.760]   I hated it.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.680]   I mean, it would have been faster and easier for me to drive out to Venice and get some
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.680]   ***** boardwalk to draw pictures of us.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.240]   Oh my God.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.240]   That was close.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:37.840]   I told him I was taking this to the garbage as if.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.840]   No iPhones in the house.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:40.840]   Huh?
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.840]   Why, Bill?
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.840]   Why?
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.840]   Why is that?
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.840]   Why no iPhones in the house?
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.840]   I can tell you.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   I know why.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.840]   Because you don't like anything that's awesome.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.840]   You ****** nerd.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:51.840]   Okay.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.840]   I'll let you watch the rest.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   You don't like it.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.840]   That's awesome.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.440]   That's taking the theme and running with it.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.880]   That's all I can say.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:11.000]   But you have to think Melinda might be thinking that in her heart of hearts.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   That's pretty funny.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.240]   I mean, if you work for a company, would you be upset if your kids use day competing
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.240]   product?
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.240]   I let my kids watch Tekzilla.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.240]   I've never been in that observation, obviously.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.240]   So, aww.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   That hurt me.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:25.640]   If they wanted to watch Tekzilla, it'd be okay.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.120]   I could live with that.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.120]   No, I guess I understand, but that's going-
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.920]   That's what that means to each other, Leo.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   We're supplementary.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   Not competing.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   No, I'm just kidding, of course.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.240]   I don't- I think that's going a little far, saying you may not have an iPod in the house.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.160]   Well, I mean, it's humor.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.600]   I can't imagine- No, no, no, no.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.600]   No, no.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   She said this in an interview for Real.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   Really?
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.400]   Well, the real solution should be, "Tell me why you want the iPod so we can make a better
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   product."
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:56.080]   Or you could just- Or be the first kid on your blog to have a Zoom.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   Melinda?
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:02.960]   Microsoft, I'm reading this from the age.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:03.960]   .com.au.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.560]   Microsoft founder Bill Gates has banned iPods and iPhones from his household.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.700]   The software and billionaires wife Melinda has revealed.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.700]   This is not the joke.
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.400]   This is the story.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:17.680]   The rivalry between Microsoft and Apple and Gates and Apple founder Steve Jobs is legendary,
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.040]   but the pair have made valiant efforts to conceal any animosity.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:26.320]   But behind the scenes, Apple is the forbidden fruit in Microsoft quarters.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:27.320]   She's talking with Vogue.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:31.700]   She says, "There are very few things that are on the banned list in our household, but
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:36.840]   iPods and iPhones are two things we don't get for our kids.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.100]   Every now and then," says Melinda.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:44.300]   I look at my friends and say, "Ooh, I wouldn't mind having that iPhone."
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.300]   Oh, snap.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:47.300]   Snap.
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.300]   Wow.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:52.540]   I'm not saying that's from an Apple fan person perspective.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:56.540]   I'm just saying, "Man, if Bill hears her say that, hears her say that, she can't be
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:57.540]   pissed."
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.620]   I think this funnier dice kit is not too far off.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:02.620]   Me.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:04.340]   I think that's why it inspired it.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.340]   They're like, "Wait a second.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.340]   There's something to this."
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:08.340]   There's something going on.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.340]   Quiet as it's kept, I've banned @willwheaton from my house.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:16.340]   I knew there was something there.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:24.420]   No, well, didn't Shatner have a rivalry with George Tk?
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.420]   George Tk.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.860]   They didn't get along very well.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.340]   There was a big, big time.
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.300]   Big time, between the two of them.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.300]   So it happens.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.300]   It happens.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.300]   You got to work together.
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:35.500]   You're wearing the outfits.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:39.580]   Maybe you both wore red that day, and it's embarrassing.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.620]   Sometimes something can blow up and get bigger.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:43.620]   I don't know.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.940]   On one hand, it seems really petty.
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:50.260]   On the other hand, it's like, if you enjoy the lifestyle we lead, it would be like the
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:54.460]   kids of the chairman of GM having Toyota's.
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:58.140]   Well, maybe not Toyota, since there's some stuff they've worked on together.
[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.660]   Or maybe they're flying jets instead of driving their own car.
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.660]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.940]   There's a good announcement.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:06.180]   Engines by Rolls Royce.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:13.420]   Do you think that Steve Jobs does not allow Windows machines in the house?
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.420]   That'd be cool.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.420]   Absolutely.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:16.420]   No.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   He probably doesn't allow colors in the house.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.420]   It's all white.
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:20.940]   It's got to all be white.
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.580]   How about Zunes?
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.500]   If Steve Jobs' kid came up and said, "Dad, I want to Zune."
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.900]   Steve Jobs is not going to say, "You may not have a Zune."
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.460]   He's going to say, "No, you know what?
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.900]   Steve Jobs is going to do."
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.940]   Steve Jobs, from what I've heard from people that have worked on, is going to scream at
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.300]   the top of his heads about if he won an inferior piece of whatever.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.620]   If you want to use an inferior product, go ahead.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.620]   Bring them to Zune.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.620]   Go ahead.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.620]   Go ahead.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.780]   Time the kid walks around with a Zune to be like, "You know what?
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:47.980]   You could have an iPod, which is the real device for listening to your music."
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.940]   No, you want an inferior.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:50.940]   Zune.
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:51.940]   That's pretty funny.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.940]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.540]   Let's get a headache just pretending.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.340]   Barney Frank wants to bring back online gambling.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.340]   This is interesting.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:07.460]   The Republicans banned online gambling, making it illegal in the United States in 2006, barring
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.740]   businesses from knowingly accepting payments and connection with internet gambling, which
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:12.940]   was already illegal.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:16.820]   So basically, the credit card company said, "Guess we can't help you.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:22.660]   This cost European companies where most of the gambling sites were a lot of money.
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:27.420]   In fact, people were arrested the minute they stepped out of a plane on U.S. soil."
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:33.620]   Advocates of lifting the ban say, "It's an impingement of personal liberty."
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.940]   And by the way, a couple of billion dollars in revenue that you're losing over the next
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.780]   decade by not allowing internet gambling.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.980]   Think of all the tax money you could make.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.060]   Was it an unfair effort for internet gambled?
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.060]   I have not.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.060]   I did not play it.
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.060]   Be honest.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.060]   It's cool.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.060]   No one will judge anyone.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.060]   No, I wouldn't.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.060]   You know, I go to party.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.060]   I would go to partypoker.com.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.060]   I'm afraid of getting.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:01.260]   I'm afraid of being the fish at the table that they just took.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.260]   I don't know how to play any gambling games like that.
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.580]   So I wouldn't even know where to start.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.380]   But why are you must play?
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.380]   You must play.
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.380]   I love poker.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:14.660]   And part of the appeal is being eye to eye with people and reading them.
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.780]   That's so hard to do online.
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.300]   I just don't...
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.300]   I don't see the appeal.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:26.780]   To me, it's better engaged in one-on-one setting with other human beings.
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.580]   I can't imagine getting any joy out of playing online.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:37.580]   I think people, in a way, it might appeal to people who really have a gambling problem
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.860]   because it means you can gamble anytime anywhere.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:40.860]   Yeah, sure.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.860]   Dangerous.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:42.860]   It's actually dangerous.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.220]   Well, with all due respect, I mean, on one hand, yeah, it means you could blow the
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:50.340]   Brent money without leaving the house, but on the other hand, there's an Indian casino
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.340]   in about every 500 yards.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.340]   Well, and that's why that law was passed, I'm sure.
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:58.460]   Is Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Indian casino said, "You better not allow internet
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.460]   gambling."
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.300]   Well, there's also a put for America.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.220]   A lot of people also said it simply takes a huge amount of...
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:05.220]   It's like a 52...
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.140]   I don't know how many billions of hours.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.580]   But the basically thing was taking the money offshore.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.780]   No, interesting.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.140]   And there's also the bigger issue of cheating.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.020]   It's very hard to police this stuff.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.340]   Yeah, you would know if they were cheating you in a casino, Leo.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.340]   I mean, there's...
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:24.220]   Well, that's why we have gambling commissions to watch this stuff.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.540]   I mean, I don't know how good it's not.
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:28.060]   Well, yeah, but I understand that.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:34.540]   But there's a strong line between being cheated and having casinos play the legitimate rules
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:37.580]   as hard as they can because they're looking to maximize returns.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.620]   So they play...
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:45.060]   This goes back to our whole study of psychology thing that we were talking about earlier.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.340]   And the casinos don't...
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.020]   They may be legal, but it's not fair.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.020]   And the house always wins.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.020]   They just need to maximize.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.500]   Yeah, but you know that when you go in there.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.820]   There was a big story on 60 Minutes.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:59.620]   It was quite interesting about online gambling.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:04.540]   Apparently, one of these online gambling sites, I think it was a poker site, a former employee
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.540]   had access.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.540]   See, if you could see the cards of everybody you're playing with, you'd pretty much win
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.540]   all the time.
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:11.820]   And that's exactly what happened.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:16.100]   The guy had access to the back end software, was able to see all the cards that were dealt
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.100]   out.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.300]   And actually players became suspicious because these guys were betting when they shouldn't
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.620]   be betting by traditional poker rules.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:29.980]   They're not playing poker properly and winning massive amounts because they knew the cards.
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.940]   And by the way, there's very little recourse.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:35.260]   It's not much you could do even if you discover this.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:39.260]   It lacks that reality of seeing a real card in your hand and you almost...
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.260]   I wouldn't trust it.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:45.580]   You guys are also assuming that the poker would be the only thing people would be playing.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:49.460]   I mean, there's no reason there wouldn't be Blackjack and Pygow poker and slot machines.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.020]   I mean, the whole reason they have all these weird...
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.740]   Well, the difference is that a lot of people...
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:59.460]   I mean, there's not a lot of difference between playing slots in Atlantic City and playing
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:04.220]   slots at home, except you don't have to deal with some angry bag lady slamming down the
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.380]   nickels down the river.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.380]   It's true.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.780]   Slots is a computer, even if you're playing in Atlantic City.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:12.100]   Slots is a huge generator of revenue for casinos.
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:17.580]   And if you notice the fact that there are more slot machines now than there are gambling tables
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.340]   in terms of square footage, it means that they're generating more...
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.340]   I would just...
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:24.920]   Were I a gambler, which I'm not because I'm just not good at that kind of thing, I would
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.980]   much rather play at a casino because at least I would feel, even though the odds are probably
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.300]   stacked in their favor, that if it ever came out that somehow they were cheating players
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:38.140]   or somehow stealing money, that the reputation of that casino would be ruined.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:45.220]   And that's in their best interest to stay legitimate and have people win on a fairly regular basis,
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:49.220]   as opposed to an online site, which I can't check that at all.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:54.300]   I have no idea what their reputation is really other than a cursory search online.
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.620]   It just feels a little more legitimate in real life as opposed to online.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.980]   And if you're spending an awful lot of money to do this hobby, you may as well go to the
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.980]   most reputable...
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.980]   Reputable.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.220]   That reputable place you can.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.620]   If online gambling is legalized in the United States, the first people that are going to
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:15.500]   be there are all of the familiar brands from Las Vegas and Atlantic City and the Indian
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.940]   casinos, and it will be regulated.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:22.020]   Like, you know, basically have some form of regulation and...
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.620]   So maybe it isn't the casinos that are fighting this.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.260]   Who is fighting it?
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.260]   Is it a moral...
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.260]   I don't know.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:32.020]   I still feel like unless they could really prove that they'd be making a lot of money online,
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.900]   which they probably would, they still want people to come to their casinos as opposed
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:41.340]   to playing online, because they still make a lot of money on hotels and on food and all
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:43.620]   the touristy stuff that goes down at the casino, right?
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:44.620]   Or do you think they would just...
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.340]   No, the casinos make money on gambling.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.260]   The casinos make money on gambling.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.620]   Gambling is the game, is the thing that...
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.340]   Actually, that's not true anymore.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.340]   That's not true anymore.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.500]   The loss of leaders.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.500]   No, no, they're not.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   There is no sense.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.500]   They're not.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.340]   Since they started $500 of room...
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:07.860]   No, since the corporations came in, and especially in the last five to ten years with the mega
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:13.060]   casinos, every branch of the casino actually has to generate profits.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:17.820]   And the hotels and restaurants have become actually...
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:21.700]   They're generating more revenue off the hotels and restaurants now in Vegas than they are
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.780]   off the gaming floor.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:27.260]   They probably realize that gamblers will come even if they don't get the $2 buffet.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.460]   I'm going to start a card counting scheme.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.660]   But they still do free drinks.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.500]   They still do free drinks while you're gambling?
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.500]   Yes, drunk people make stupid decisions.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.740]   What is your card counting scheme going to be...
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.100]   You know, there is a card counting application for the iPhone.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.740]   Oh, well go watch that one.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.740]   Yes, there is.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.740]   Oh, 21?
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.740]   Yeah, it was not cool.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:46.740]   21.
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:50.820]   But in that interesting though, they have an application for counting cars.
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.420]   And the casinos are doing what about this?
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.420]   They're banning the phone.
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:55.420]   They're banning...
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.420]   They're banning iPhones.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.420]   Yeah, they use your phone.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.420]   They've never been.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.180]   They're not going to take a BlackBerry at the table but just not your iPhone.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.020]   No, no, I think it's cell phones in general.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:06.460]   Yeah, you can't have a phone or an electronic device at the table the last...
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.460]   If you want to take a call, step away.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.060]   Well, that's appropriate.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:14.580]   I don't want somebody taking calls at the table while I'm losing my shirt.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.980]   No, I'm kind of curious about...
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.140]   Instead of just thinking about gambling as what do you do to casino now and doing that
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:24.140]   online, but online gambling, you can gamble about anything.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:29.260]   And especially if you think about gambling and say sports, if you can do that on the
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:34.060]   internet, what's going to keep referees and pretries and players...
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.060]   That's a good point.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.620]   ... getting jumping online to gamble on those games.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:43.580]   If you make it legitimate, it actually could be more strongly regulated on the internet.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:47.100]   Because if you tie it into a credit card or something versus being able to walk in with
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.100]   a pile of...
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.100]   You know what I mean?
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.580]   There's nothing to stop a zebra from walking into the sports book at the insert name of
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.940]   casino here and laying down a bet on the game.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:00.580]   You know, is the circus...
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:03.900]   Since I recently had the pleasure of staying at the circus at sea.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.180]   No, that's sad.
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.980]   Yeah, it was inexpensive and I am at a start-up.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:10.980]   So...
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:14.780]   But I mean, there's nothing...
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:18.420]   It's not hard to circumvent controls...
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.420]   But it's controls that they are.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:23.220]   Gambling is essentially an anonymous event.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.940]   You walk in, you lay down cash, you get a receipt, you turn the receipt back in based
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.420]   on whether or not you won.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.660]   You know what I mean?
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.580]   You walk into a gaming table or a slot machine with cash and you walk back out with cash
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:39.740]   unless you make more than whatever the current cap is on gambling revenues.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.220]   Which is what makes it a...
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.220]   You know what I mean?
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.220]   There's nothing to...
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.220]   There's nothing to...
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.220]   It's very easy.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:49.500]   There's still a huge amount of illegal sports gambling in the United States.
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:53.620]   They still bolt the remote control for the TV to the table at the circus circus.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:54.620]   No.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.420]   The rooms I was staying in.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.420]   That was when I knew it.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.940]   This is not a great hotel.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.980]   They bolted the remote control to the table.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.300]   The lamp was bolted to the table.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.940]   Like, I'm going to take their remote control and their crappy clown lamp.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:09.500]   There's a big difference between staying in like the outdoor, like, motel-y kind of
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   area versus towers.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.140]   The towers are a lot better.
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.500]   I must have stayed in the cheap seats.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.500]   That was by the way.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.500]   The towers used to be a lot worse.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.980]   Well, Tech TV also had the habit of deciding to go to the last minutes.
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:22.980]   It's the last minute.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.100]   So, I mean, having stayed at the fabulous...
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:30.220]   I've stayed in at this point over 34 hotels in Las Vegas.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.220]   Wow.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.340]   Because I'm not there for trade shows so much.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.500]   And at this point, I got to say that there's...
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:41.260]   The most depressing thing about the circus circus is walking by little fleets of children
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:46.020]   waiting outside the gaming floor at 9.30 on a Saturday night for their parents.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:51.220]   It's much more depressing than staying at the Blair Witch House in and counting the
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:56.620]   hundreds of cigarette burns on every horizontal surface in the room.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.820]   You feel like Nick Cage must have stayed here at some point.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:04.420]   No, Nick Cage refused to stay there.
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:05.500]   All right, one last story.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:10.940]   As long as we're in the land of vice, Craig's List is being sued as Sheriff in Illinois,
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:14.740]   accuses Craig's List of promoting prostitution.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:15.740]   Cook County Sheriff...
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:16.740]   No.
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:17.740]   Ha ha ha.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.740]   I have a feeling gambling has been going on in here, Rick.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:26.260]   Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart says the site was failing to block offers to trade sex for
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.260]   money.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:31.620]   He wants a federal judge to shut down the erotic services section.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.620]   Ha ha ha ha.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.180]   We talked about this on Buzz out loud the other day.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.100]   Also, I guess sit on there.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:42.940]   And my kind of stance on it is that Craig's List has been doing and working with law enforcement
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.460]   agencies for as long as they've been around.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:50.380]   And they do have a pretty good way of making sure that prostitution isn't happening.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:53.380]   Even though it does, they do make sure they call people back.
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:57.020]   They make people supply a phone number when they're leaving these postings.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.300]   And it's going to happen from time to time.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:03.220]   But I don't understand why the law enforcement agency in this case is suing them.
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:04.900]   Because they think having categories.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:10.500]   They're making it easier, but at the same time they're helping law enforcement agencies
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.980]   find these illegal prostitution rings.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.020]   Isn't that kind of helping them in a way?
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.020]   I agree.
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:20.340]   And do you think more people to take part in this or not?
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:23.700]   I mean, that's why I said this back down to anything about it, Veronica.
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.460]   Not that I know a thing about it.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:30.500]   But my understanding is that there's a lot of law enforcement on Craig's List looking
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:37.300]   for sex or for people having sex, illicitly.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.820]   With the intent of arresting them.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.820]   Yes, no.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:40.820]   Have sex.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:41.820]   Or for fun.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.820]   Or for fun.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.380]   But you just got to let it out.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.380]   Law enforcement.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:49.300]   Law enforcement does use Craig's List as a sting tool.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:53.060]   It does seem to me that if you wanted to stay undercover, advertising on Craigslist would
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.260]   not be a good way of doing it.
[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.260]   I mean, this is-
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:03.540]   But they advertise in the back of the Guardian and the SF Weekly and every major town as
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.380]   ads for illicit naughty services.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.900]   So I'm just looking here.
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:11.460]   Craig's List, men seeking women, you get the list.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:14.020]   It's not men seeking women.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.420]   It's not an actual erotic services category.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.300]   How could that not be prostitution?
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.300]   Are they free?
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.500]   You know, I never really got into it.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.500]   Oh, yeah, there is.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.100]   Okay, here it is.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.740]   Erotic services warning and disclaimer.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:31.300]   Unless all of the following points are true, please use your back button.
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.500]   That sounds dirty right there.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.500]   That's what she said.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.100]   I'm at least 18 years old.
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:39.140]   I understand erotic services may include adult content.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:45.740]   I agree to flag as prohibited anything illegal or in violation of the terms of use, including
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:50.100]   offers or for solicitation of prostitution.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.340]   I agree to report suspected exploitation of minors through appropriate authorities.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:58.940]   And then then big yellow letters, human trafficking and exploitation of minors are not tolerated
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:02.460]   any suspected activity will be reported to law enforcement.
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:03.980]   Right, so, but this is prostitution.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.140]   I mean, it's right.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.140]   Erotic services.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:09.300]   I was planning to be a subset of that.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:13.260]   I'm not sure exactly what other services they're providing that are legitimate, but
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.660]   well, I guess dancing is erotic, but not illegal.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:20.180]   Like, do you want to hire a stripper for your bachelor party?
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.380]   Yeah, that would be a role.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:23.380]   Okay, that'll be a role.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:27.700]   I came to this and I highly recommend anybody with children not skim this if the children
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.700]   are around.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:34.500]   There's nobody offering anything involving bachelor party services in here.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.580]   Eoretically, however, they could.
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:38.580]   Yes.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:44.980]   Well, I guess my real question is so clearly this whole thing is that.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:50.020]   So what is it just that there's so many in there that law enforcement just is going
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:52.580]   to turn their eye away?
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:54.780]   I don't, I mean, it's.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:55.780]   You got to remember something.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.380]   Your suing doesn't seem like the right answer.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.580]   Why are they suing?
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.980]   Why is he suing?
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:07.100]   They're suing for, you know, because they've put a lot of time and effort into hunting
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.460]   down these people that are using it for illegal reasons.
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.180]   And so they say that's money that they've wasted.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.900]   Oh, they want their money back.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.220]   But I think that's money that they've used to actually catch people doing things that
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.220]   are illegal.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.220]   That's their job.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:23.780]   I didn't realize that they want 100,000 for that it's, they want the 100,000 back that
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.140]   they spent pursuing Craigslist investigations.
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.140]   Right.
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.820]   I mean, what did they not find anything in these investigations?
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.460]   Like maybe then that would make sense.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.620]   No, you know what he said?
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:33.820]   Here he is.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:37.740]   I could make arrests off Craigslist 24 hours a day, but to what end by filing.
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.740]   Well, that's right.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.820]   He said, I'm trying to go up the ladder.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.940]   He says he's been working with Craigslist representatives for months, sending letters,
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.780]   requesting them to take down or provide greater self policing of their erotic services section,
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.460]   but his pleas have been met with no response.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:53.700]   The sheriff said he believes the company has been under sponsored because the erotic services
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:57.300]   section generates a large portion of the company's $80 million annual revenue.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.300]   I don't know.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.300]   I almost don't even believe that.
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:01.100]   How does the company make money?
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.900]   Do they charge people for the last charge?
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:06.100]   I know they charge for, uh, or at Craigslist.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.100]   No Craigslist charges.
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.100]   Job listing.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:12.260]   Job listing and apartment listings, I think in certain markets, but not anything else,
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.260]   right?
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.260]   The rest of it's free.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.260]   Oh, look at that.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.260]   Hold on.
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.260]   There's an end of it.
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.260]   Job and apartments.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.340]   Job and apartments only, I guess, huh?
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.180]   No, actually $50 for me.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.180]   Let me try to.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.180]   Let me try to.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:28.140]   According to the Chronicle, as of November 7, 2008, Craigslist was discharged for erotic
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.140]   services ads.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.140]   Ah, ha.
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:31.140]   Ah, ha.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:34.620]   There may be some merit to this.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:40.220]   But, you know, I still don't really buy it because the company is so small and Craig
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:46.020]   is so integral to the daily operations of the company that I just don't believe that
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.460]   if someone was trying to work with them, maybe I'm naive.
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:54.260]   But if someone in law enforcement was trying to work with them on, you know, making something
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:58.180]   bad like this stop that they wouldn't even respond, like it just doesn't make sense knowing
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.140]   what I know about that company.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.780]   All right.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:06.980]   Well, there's a, I guess there's a difference between the erotic services and just the dating
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.380]   on Craigslist then, right?
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.380]   Yes.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.380]   Yes.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:11.940]   One with the whole dating is necessarily erotic.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.300]   Having met my wife on Craigslist before, yes.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.300]   I'd like to.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.300]   Did you really?
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.300]   Yes, I did.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.300]   Thank you.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.300]   In the erotic services section?
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.300]   No.
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.300]   And were you buying a sofa?
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.300]   No, I was not buying a sofa.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.300]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.300]   So I didn't know there was a great story.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:31.900]   And there was no law enforcement had any hand in the idea.
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:34.300]   I guess I was a cop.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.140]   It's just the mother of my child you're talking about here.
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.140]   All right.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.140]   Very interesting.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.980]   I got my job at DNET on Craigslist.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:43.980]   You did?
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:44.980]   That's not erotic.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:45.980]   Not erotic.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.980]   I've never done anything on Craigslist at all, but maybe I will.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.980]   Maybe I'll start.
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.980]   You've never used Craigslist, period?
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:52.980]   Uh-uh.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:53.980]   I've looked.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.980]   I don't think I've ever actually converted.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:02.100]   Like there's a, there's actually a great article on this from SF Gate, which is our local paper
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.940]   in San Francisco.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:07.940]   In November, the attorney general of Connecticut threatened legal action after receiving complaints
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.100]   about photographs depicting nudity.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.260]   Craigslist came to an agreement with 40 attorney generals around the United States.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:18.220]   He instituted policies aimed at reducing the amount of prostitution, including requiring
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:22.420]   advertisers for erotic massage, strippers, escort services, and the like to pay a fee
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:25.260]   with a credit card.
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:26.260]   Hmm.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:28.020]   And what does that do, I guess?
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.540]   And Dart said the agreement between Craigslist and the attorney general has resulted in no
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.060]   appreciable reduction of ads of prostitution on the site.
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:37.060]   Doesn't, doesn't get around anything.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.820]   And he says Craigslist does not monitor it.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:42.060]   And when his officers have attempted to contact Craigslist, they have been ignored or not.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.500]   I think they have a pretty good case.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:49.420]   If Craigslist, if the three things they charge for are rooms, jobs, and erotic services,
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:50.740]   they can make a pretty good case.
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:51.740]   This is important.
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:52.740]   It's a good Craig on here.
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:54.740]   Craig on here and ask him.
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:55.740]   All right.
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.740]   Absolutely.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.740]   Deal.
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.740]   Not the most.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.740]   He's open to that kind of thing.
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:02.740]   I would, we'll do that.
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:03.740]   That's a great idea.
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.740]   Craig, what's the deal?
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.740]   What's the deal?
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.740]   And Craig's on Twitter.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.740]   Absolutely.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.740]   He's a pretty active Twitter.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.740]   That's really funny.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.740]   I think it's a very personalized choice for those intent on committing crimes, since criminals
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:19.300]   inevitably leave an electronic trail to themselves that law enforcement officers will
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.140]   follow on a daily basis.
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:25.620]   We're being of direct assistance to police departments and federal authorities nationwide.
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:30.020]   So could this be, could this be twisted as a violation of First Amendment rights?
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.020]   It kind of sounds like a honey pot.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.620]   They're kind of luring people in, charging them money and then calling the cops.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:39.220]   Well, no, they're responding to, they're responding to, question the cops.
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:43.380]   But it's interesting that darts just annoyed that the sheriff dart is annoyed, you know,
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:48.620]   in Chicago that he has to, I am shocked, shocked to learn that there are adult services going
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   on in here.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:50.620]   Exactly.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.620]   All right.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.060]   Colleen says she wants to kickbox you for charity Veronica.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.060]   Are you up for it?
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.060]   No way.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.060]   She's killing me.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.060]   She's scary.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.060]   Crazy?
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.060]   Okay.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.060]   I'm just checking.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.700]   I'm scrappy, but she could take me.
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.700]   Scrappy.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.700]   The scrappy Veronica Belmont.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.700]   Co-host.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.700]   I have been working on my guns lately.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.980]   What's with all the violence though recently?
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:14.260]   I callocanis with the boxing list.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:15.260]   Howard Lindzen.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.260]   Howard Lindzen.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.100]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.500]   Everybody just duke it out.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.980]   It's the bad economy.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:21.980]   Settle it in the ring.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.820]   Makes people turn towards violence.
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:27.620]   We had a violence free event on Tuesday.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:28.620]   Tuesday.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.620]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:33.540]   I first want to say Veronica Belmont and Patrick Norton, our host of Tekzilla, which
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:39.420]   you could find on revision three site or just go to TEKZILA.com.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.420]   And it's a great show.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:43.740]   You got the Tekzilla Daily News and you got the Tekzilla show and the whole thing.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:44.740]   It's all there.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.740]   Tekzilla Daily Tip Leo.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.740]   Tip?
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:47.740]   No.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:48.740]   With even news to the professionals.
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:49.740]   It's not news.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.740]   It's tips.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:51.740]   But it's Tekzilla Daily.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:52.740]   I got that right.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:53.740]   Yes.
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:54.740]   Yes, he did.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:55.740]   All right.
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.740]   Thank you.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.740]   LeVar Burton.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.740]   What are you up to?
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.300]   Anything you want me to plug for you, LeVar?
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:03.900]   Actually, I start rehearsals on a play tomorrow.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:04.900]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:05.900]   What's the play?
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:06.900]   You're Los Angeles.
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:10.300]   The play is called "The Caterer" written by my friend Brian Allen Lane.
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:14.060]   It is the story of a man who sells you your own appropriate death.
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:15.460]   Oh, I like that.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.220]   And are you the guy who sells or are you buyer?
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.220]   I am.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.220]   No, no, no, no.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:20.220]   What a great role.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.220]   Fair of death.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:23.140]   What a great role.
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:26.140]   Is it true that the bad guys are more fun than the good guys to play?
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.660]   I am about to find out.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.060]   This will be your first?
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:30.060]   Like the dad would play.
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:31.660]   Really, you're always a good guy.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.660]   I'm traditionally.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.660]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.700]   We should all make a field trip to go see him in the play.
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:37.700]   Deal.
[01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:38.700]   Come see me.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:39.700]   Come see me.
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:40.700]   Deal.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:41.700]   When is it open?
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.700]   We open April 15th.
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:43.700]   All right.
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:44.700]   Soo.
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:45.700]   Road trip.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:46.700]   We're going down to see LeVar Burton in "The Caterer."
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:47.700]   Awesome.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:51.500]   It'd be the White Fire Theater right here in Sherman House, California.
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:52.500]   Awesome.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.020]   Oh, I could go down and see my syndicators in Sherman Oaks.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:56.020]   We'll just be great.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:57.020]   It'll be fun.
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.020]   Come on down.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.020]   Come on down.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:03.260]   It's about 5 o'clock on Sunday, and that's Family Dinner Sunday Dinner time.
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.260]   Sounds great.
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.700]   I'm getting the high sign from Stephanie Burton.
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.700]   Well, thank you for the pizza.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.100]   I'm for me to start playing and come in and have dinner.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.100]   See you later, LeVar.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.100]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.100]   We really appreciate it.
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.100]   Leo, you're the man.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.100]   I love you.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.380]   Veronica, Patrick, Brian, and Mary, Chris.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:20.380]   Hi, Chris.
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:21.380]   Everybody, thanks.
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.380]   Take care, LeVar.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.380]   God bless.
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:24.380]   God bless.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:28.940]   Chris Huchen's rather is doing a laid off camp coming up next to when.
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:29.940]   And where?
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:33.060]   The next solid date is April 13th down in LA.
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.580]   Or April 13th down in LA.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.060]   Right before LeVar's opening night.
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.060]   Exactly.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.060]   It's perfect timing.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.140]   Maybe I'll be down there for the whole weekend.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:43.740]   And you can find out more at laidoffcamp.com.
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:44.740]   That's the wiki.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:47.020]   And there are going to be laid off camps all over the country.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.260]   All over the country.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.460]   But not sad, not solemn.
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:51.460]   Not solemn.
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.620]   It's an opportunity to find something you're passionate about and put yourself to a new
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:57.020]   line of work that might make you happy.
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.020]   Absolutely awesome.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.020]   Fantastic.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.020]   Thank you, Chris.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.020]   Sure.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:03.060]   Brian Shaler is an engineer at BitGravity.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:07.940]   We'll soon be using his services to make this more grave.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.460]   And he's also the jumper.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:10.460]   The jumper.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:11.460]   A jump and write code.
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.060]   And jumps and writes code, not in that order.
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.060]   It's great to see you, Brian.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.060]   Thanks for coming by.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.060]   I really appreciate it.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:20.740]   I'm glad I canceled my flight and stayed in town for you.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.140]   Yeah, what fun we had.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.140]   Exactly.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:24.620]   He had a brain tonic too and everything.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:25.620]   So that's great.
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.620]   Brain tonic.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:30.940]   It's almost worth the $200 I had to pay to cancel my family.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.140]   I'll give you another chance.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.140]   And the pizza.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.140]   And the pizza.
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.740]   Oh, Leo, thank you for the can, by the way.
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.860]   Yeah, we were going to send you a case.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:42.340]   And then Kiki said, you know, I really don't think she wants to have a case at the movie
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.300]   theater of brain tonic.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:47.260]   So she doesn't know me very well.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.260]   We'll send you a case.
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:52.140]   And maybe we'll get you some diet, Dr. Pepper II with caffeine.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.140]   Oh, thank you.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:54.140]   With caffeine.
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:56.140]   Another twit.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.140]   Is in the can.
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:23:59.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:00.140]   Yeah.

[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:11.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:12.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:15.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:16.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:19.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.140]   Yeah.
