[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.880]   It's time for "Twit This Week in Tech," the show where we cover the week's news.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.200]   This, ladies and gentlemen, is a momentous occasion for a number of reasons.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.520]   First of all, it is our 900th episode, "Twit 900."
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   I know that's kind of hard to believe.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.400]   Second, because we're being taken over by the Rocket podcast.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.960]   It's so exciting for me.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.160]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.160]   From right to left.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.480]   Well, you all know Brianna with my right, your left, Rebellion Pack.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.440]   She's been here many, many times.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.240]   Welcome, Brianna.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   Great to have you.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   I have some questions.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.320]   I think I was on like three weeks ago and now I just, I'm back.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.200]   I'm busting up in your show again.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.240]   Well, I think when you were on three weeks ago, you said we should do a Rocket show.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240]   And you invited us.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.080]   I was like, "Yes, we're going to make it happen."
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.000]   I know what happened because I said, "I can never get Simone to show up."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.160]   We try and we try to get her on the show and she never can do it.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160]   And you said, "I'll talk to her."
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.960]   I said, "Well, why don't you get Christina too while you're at it and we'll make it
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   a Rocket takeover."
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   Here's Christina Warren.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   Hello.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   In studio.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   In studio.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   Senior developer advocate for GitHub.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   GitHub's having an event this week.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   Yes.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.080]   GitHub universe is a GitHub universe.com.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   Please like register.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.640]   But that's going to be Wednesday and Thursday at a your way to a convention center here in
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   San Francisco.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.880]   And it will also be streamed online.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   So I'm in town for that.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.880]   Nice.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.720]   And what's actually funny is that I'd reached out like, we wanted to get you on because
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   you were going to be in town.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   Exactly.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   So you can come in.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   So I was going to, I was already planning on being here.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.120]   And I think that's why we're doing it so quickly, Brianna, because, oh, we have, we have two out
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.120]   of the three.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.080]   If only somebody knew Simone de Rochefort, we could ask her to be on.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   Simone.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   Simone is here.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.360]   She's, she's, she's finally joining us from her dungeon.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.960]   You have this my windowless dungeon.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.360]   You know, now that I know you live in Manhattan, I understand that this is actually a palace.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.360]   Right.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   It is.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.360]   Where's your kitchen?
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   Is that over on the left there with the bell?
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   Yeah, right back there.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   Just right back there.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   I just climb into the closet.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.880]   I turn on my little Bunsen burner.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.360]   I've never seen smaller kitchens in my life than a New York.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   Oh yeah.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   It's great.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.680]   You get like, if you have a dishwasher, which I did in Brooklyn, but it was not a full size
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.880]   was like the half size dishwasher, which is almost worse than no dishwasher at all because
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.920]   like you can maybe get one pan in it.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.560]   The temptation and the possibility is there, but the reality exactly.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.680]   I did.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.120]   They had, remember Bob, the mini dishwasher at a, no, that's not it.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120]   No, wait a minute.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.160]   Let me find it at a CES last earlier this year.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   Oh yeah.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   It's a personal dishwasher.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   Yes.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.160]   It was tiny.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.240]   And I thought, well, who would want that?
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.120]   Now I know people who have small apartments, people like you.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.960]   It was just a little Bob, little dishwasher on your sink like that.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   Oh, it's so cute.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   Oh, that's so cute.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.320]   Oh, I love that.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   That's great.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.040]   Can I say something to people?
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   Just wash your goddamn dishes.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   Okay.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   Hang on.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   No, I mean, that is what most of us wind up doing because we don't have a dishwasher,
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.520]   but yes, this dishwasher holds three dishes and a casserole.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.440]   You could wash it and half the time it would take to load the damn thing.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.440]   It's true.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.040]   I have two important points to make.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.440]   One, you should always hand wash pans, knives, things like that.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.200]   There's no reason for them in the dishwasher.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   Very important.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.160]   However, do you put your silverware handle up or handle down?
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.160]   Handle down.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   Okay.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.480]   I do mind handle up.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   It's controversial.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   I know.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   I know.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.720]   Well, my wife and I, she throws everything in the dishwasher, including my beautiful
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   knives with the wooden handles.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   Oh no.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.440]   I got to the point where I buy wooden spoons by the dozen now because I know they're going
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.000]   to get warped and ruined and everything goes in the dishwasher.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.800]   But then we had a fight when we first got together many years ago, handle up or handle
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   down.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.000]   So that's why I'm asking.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.200]   My personal feeling is you put the tongs down so that you can remove them and hold them
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   by the handle.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   You don't want to pick it out.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   Exactly.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.000]   I don't have to sterilize myself to get my silverware out of the dishwasher.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You agree?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I'm not the only person with you.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Apparently someone does not.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.280]   Or are you putting tongs in the dishwasher?
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   Those are hand wash.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   No, no, just regular silverware.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.280]   Yeah, like putting the fork down.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   You don't want to tie yourself.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   Oh, the tines.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.280]   Tines down and tines up is the question.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   I do.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   Kitchen knives.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.960]   You don't mess around with that.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.680]   If you cook seriously, that is, especially your favorite chef's knife.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.160]   That is, you don't like, if I found that Frank put my chef's knife in the dishwasher, we
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   would have a fight.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   I've broken her.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   That's the question.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   Oh, go on.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   No, yeah.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160]   Move on.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   Move on.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.800]   The real question in my mind is how much is this going to be like Rocket?
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   And how much is going to be like Twitter?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.360]   I could talk about washing dishes for literally the whole three hour show.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.520]   You're trying to turn this into Rocket.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.120]   We've literally never once talked about housework on Rocket.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.120]   Oh.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.560]   We actually haven't, even though it's my favorite thing.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   Wow.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.040]   Well, here's your opportunities, Simone.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.400]   Rocket is a wonderful podcast and relay FM that talks about really a lot about news,
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   right?
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.280]   In fact, I'm going to apologize because I think we're going to kind of rerun your last
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   show a little bit.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   That's completely fine.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.200]   Because there's been more stuff since we had to record on Tuesday because I was going out
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.120]   of town and everything that happened between Tuesday and now, it's a whole other show.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.000]   Elon fired everybody on Friday.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.600]   He sent out a note saying on Thursday, "Don't come in."
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.320]   By the way, I love it that it was signed Twitter.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.120]   Elon, we know it's you.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.120]   Don't come in.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.920]   We're locking the office because we're going to lay a lot of people off.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.320]   All of you, this is cruel.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.800]   All of you are going to get an email with a subject line, something like your future
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   at Twitter.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   Yes.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.680]   And then we'll read the mail and learn whether you are staying or leaving.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.320]   Well, it would depend on where it went.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.800]   If it went to your personal mail, that means that you're gone because you've been locked
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   out of everything.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.720]   But if it went to your work mail, then congratulations, you are still employed for the moment.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.960]   I can't imagine anything handled more poorly.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   Me either.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.120]   This is the worst layoff in history, worse than the guy who fired everybody on Zoom.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   Okay.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.000]   So you think it's worse than that because I was having this debate with some people
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.080]   in a signal chat where we were trying to decide, I think overall this is worse because there
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.600]   was no communication for the whole week that he'd owned the company.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.040]   Poor people were just twisting in the wind.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.040]   Agreed.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.200]   And I think the uncertainty was so bad, but I do wonder, I think that also just being
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.940]   called into a group Zoom meeting and being told you're fired and then the meeting cutting
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.640]   out halfway through because they were cutting everyone's access.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   Regardless, it's terrible.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.680]   Well, this was my question too, because we were talking about this a bit, Christina,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.880]   and when I initially read the story, of course, first it was the Washington Post reporting
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.040]   there might be 70% of the company laid off.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.520]   Then it was a slightly lower number, I think, when we recorded on Tuesday.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.000]   And then it ended up being a ton of people.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.280]   And as I was reading about how this was done, which does seem very cruel, I did start wondering
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.340]   like what is the right way to do this in a world where so many people do work from home
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.040]   at this exact moment?
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.660]   And that question was kind of answered for us by the Stripe layoffs, which we talked
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.840]   about Christina, which like obviously layoffs are terrible and one would hope that you would
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.360]   never have to live through them and they're hard for people who are laid off.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.200]   They're hard for the people who remain behind at the company.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.360]   But when we compare the Twitter email with the email that Stripe sent out to their employees,
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.640]   there's just a huge difference in the clarity of the communication that happened to the
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.120]   people who were laid off.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.840]   No, I think you're exactly right.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.920]   I'm also really struck by the methodology that they used to decide who they were going
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   to fire.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920]   It was bizarre.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.880]   They went through and for the engineering talent, it was like who had the most like
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.640]   lines of code that they submitted.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   That's crazy.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.800]   They asked people to print out their code.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.920]   In fact, Leah Culver tweeted a picture of her with the code she'd committed.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   And then a couple of things weird about that.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   First of all, they brought in Tesla engineers to talk to you about your code commits, engineers
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.200]   working on a completely different product.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.120]   By the way, don't already don't have the best track record.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.560]   Well, not only that, but like are not JavaScript engineers.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   Twitter is like a...
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.560]   Not front end.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   No, exactly.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.760]   Twitter is largely a JavaScript shop.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.040]   So if you're working on hardcore things that Tesla does, do you even know how to evaluate
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   that code?
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.840]   There's also, I doubt, I can't believe that...
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:44.080]   It boggles the mind that it's possible for somebody to buy a company on Friday and within
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.600]   a week, fire half the staff, knowing who to fire and who not to fire.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   I don't understand that.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   100%.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   100% of the time, the numbers are...
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   What metrics are you looking at?
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   Right.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   Well...
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   How would you know if somebody's a good employee or not?
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   You wouldn't.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   Now, from what I've...
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.920]   There's been some reporting about this and then I've heard some things independently
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.560]   that the previous executive team...
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.680]   They already had a map.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.960]   They already had listings and they'd already been asking people to make lists.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.360]   Now, in my opinion, this actually is even more frustrating because the severance packages
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.640]   from some of the reporting things we've heard was not as good as what it had ever been at
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.440]   Twitter beforehand, which means that if you knew that layoffs were coming, the humane
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.200]   thing to do would be while you still have a job as an executive to lay off those people
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.360]   the right way, to do the right thing.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.400]   And then if more people needed to be laid off, fine.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.760]   But instead, from what I understand, they basically just wanted it to be Ilan's problem
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.520]   and wanted to close the deal.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.200]   But if you come into a company, fire all the leadership and then use their roadmap for
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.280]   who else to fire, it's kind of saying, "I don't trust these guys.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.520]   They didn't do a good job running Twitter.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.600]   Oh, but by the way, let's use what they know."
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.000]   So, I find it hard to believe that that was a value.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.560]   What's the deal with the lines of code?
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.020]   Why print out your code?
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.020]   There's a famous story...
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.020]   This is Andy Hirschfeld.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.020]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.020]   Yes.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.020]   I love this.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.020]   I love this.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.360]   Andy Hirschfeld, he's writing about Bill Atkinson, arguably the greatest coder of our
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   era, one of them, certainly.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   100%.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.800]   One of the quintessential of the modern kind of gooey era people.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   Yes.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   He wrote Quick Draw.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.680]   He wrote the graphic primitives for the Macintosh.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.020]   Andy says, "In early '82, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.960]   push to ship the software within the next six months.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.440]   Some of the managers decided it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.800]   engineer, in terms of the amount of code they wrote from week to week."
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   Sound familiar?
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.720]   So, they asked every engineer to submit a form.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.400]   Bill Atkinson, legendary Bill Atkinson, had been working on optimizing Quick Draw, had
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.040]   rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:02.180]   So, on his form, he said, "I wrote minus 2,000 lines of code."
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.440]   He cut out 2,000 lines of code.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   Wow.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.480]   If you're asking me, I'd say that's a guy to hire.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   I agree.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   I agree.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   But that printout is a little short.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   It is.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.480]   100%.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.200]   But it's just such a dumb metric to base things on.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   And we don't know.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   There's a lot of mystery.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   We don't know what happened.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.240]   I was going to say, I've heard a lot of conflicting things from people who would be in a better
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.360]   position to know to say that maybe that was part of it, but that wasn't the entire thing.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.160]   Regardless, if that plays any role, it just shows just what a disaster this whole thing
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   has been.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.480]   That's the reason there's been no communication.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.200]   And that allows these narratives to build.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.800]   When there's a vacuum of information, that's when your conspiracy theories and all the
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   weirdness starts.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.400]   And I'll add one more weird piece that just came out this morning.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.160]   People are saying, this is Matt Navarro, who tweeted, "Confirm, Twitter is now asking
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.840]   some fired workers to please come back."
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.840]   Oh my God.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   Some were laid off by mistake.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.440]   They were let go before management realized their experience is needed to build the features,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   Elno.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.280]   Or as you call them, Brianna, I believe Elno is planning.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   Elno.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   Elno.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.280]   I made a typo with that.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.440]   I'm like, no, this is actually better than a viral tweet about that.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.440]   No, it's great.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   I love it.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440]   I love it.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.560]   Well, it also has the advantage that if Elno is looking for his name, which he is undoubtedly
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.040]   spending most of his day doing, he may not find Elno.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.440]   Did you all see about how a lot of this stuff leaked was that when he added some of the
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:42.000]   new lieutenants and some of his new henchmen into Twitter's Slack instance, they did not
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.160]   realize that the channels they created were not private by default.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   Oh, that's delicious.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.240]   And that's why people were able to then monitor what was happening, find documents which were
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.160]   also not private.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.880]   David Sachs's calendar was open to everyone.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.840]   And so if he was able to see, the people were able to see, oh, we're having meetings about
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.080]   layoffs here, here and here.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.800]   I mean, just the level of incompetence the whole way around.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.600]   I feel so bad for every person who's still there, every person who was there.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.520]   I know it was a messy company, but to have it happen this way and then for it to be so
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:23.880]   public and to just then have a certain contention of the internet gleefully rejoicing in this,
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.880]   it's really gross.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   I really feel for everybody.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.880]   Exactly.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.240]   Yeah, because Twitter is one of the loudest pieces of social media we have.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.960]   Tweets get printed in so many other news stories on articles all over the internet, and everyone
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.280]   on Twitter is very opinionated.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.000]   And I think we'll talk about this a little bit, but it's not the biggest social media,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.040]   but it contains some of the biggest windbags that we have, and I include myself among them.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.840]   Also, amplification, as you say.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.520]   It really goes out to the world at large if you tweet something as Donald Trump and Elon
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   Musk.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.400]   Is Elon Musk the number one sh*t poster now on Twitter?
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   I believe so.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   Oh, we can say sh*t on your show?
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.400]   No.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.560]   We'll bleep it just like we do on your show.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.960]   As Simone's the one who has to keep us in check.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.960]   I don't think there's a way to say sh*t poster without saying sh*t.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.080]   I mean, ish poster is what I say sometimes.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   Say esh poster.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   Esh poster, but that sounds like sposter.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.600]   No, I say ish poster.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.600]   Ish poster.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   Ish poster.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   Ish poster.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   But it's not as good as sh*t poster.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   It's not.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.000]   There is, I kid you not, there is somebody, probably Jason Howell, who is now assiduously
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.200]   writing down the time codes that every time you say sh*t, so keep saying it and that way...
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.960]   Jason, I'm so sorry.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.220]   That's usually my job and I'm so sorry.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.220]   You do it very well.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.220]   No, I don't.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.280]   I explicitly don't.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.840]   I get in trouble for it on an almost weekly basis.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.640]   Now, you use a high-pitched beep.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.760]   Do we use a beep, John?
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.560]   No, we reverse it.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.560]   We do silence.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.560]   Oh, I like that.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.560]   I like that better, honestly.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.560]   Sometimes you'll hear on rap record...
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.360]   We wanted to sound like Jerry Springer back in the day.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   What is Springer?
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   Beep, beep, beep.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   That's fun too.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   No, I just wanted to...
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.800]   But going back to who they fired, I wanted to say we do know a lot about which teams
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.000]   they fired at this point.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.680]   We know that one of the teams that worked on accessibility for people with disabilities,
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.280]   they're gone.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.760]   We know one of the teams that dealt with misinformation, they are gone.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:28.720]   We know that the Twitter right feature, something I've been really, really eager for them to
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   unveil finally.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   I've been talking to them in PM forever going, "Please bring this to market.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.200]   I want to use this."
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:40.360]   Like Elon is announcing that you're going to be able to do long form things on Twitter,
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.160]   and then he goes and fires the entire Twitter right team.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.360]   It's all the moves he's making.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.960]   I understand that there need to be layoffs here.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.800]   I don't think Twitter is the only overstaffed company in Silicon Valley, and I think it
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:02.040]   can make sense sometimes to take a step back, look at what you need, and refocus in a moment
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   like this.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.120]   I don't think anyone reasonable would have an issue with that.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.320]   But the thing is they came in here, they're getting people from outside the company to
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.080]   make these decisions.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.760]   It's haphazard.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.760]   You've got legacy.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:20.080]   There was a great thread on Twitter yesterday with someone who works on the reliability
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.800]   part of Twitter talking about how he is really worried about the threats to the service from
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.360]   here forward because there are people that understand all this legacy code that they
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.920]   count on to keep the thing running for high frequency events like Queen Elizabeth, and
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.400]   they're just gone now.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.840]   So like say the midterms next week, this week rather, what's going to happen when that part
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.880]   of Twitter goes down or needs someone to understand that to look at it?
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.520]   It's just going to plummet.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:55.160]   So think about the reliability of Twitter going down in the same period of time that you're
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.680]   asking people to pay $8 a month for it.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.960]   It makes no sense.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.200]   If you had to do this, there was a much smarter way to do it.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:11.240]   I think one of the people fired was the person who writes the notes for the iOS update.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.480]   Because I think this time, and Micah, thank you for pointing this out, Elon Musk wrote
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   these.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   What's new?
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.520]   Today we're adding great new features to Twitter Blue.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.480]   We have more on the way soon.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.240]   Get Twitter Blue for $7.99 a month if you sign up now.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.560]   Is that actually, then I heard that everybody wasn't getting that option, that they're rolling
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   it out.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.880]   Blue check mark, colon, power to the people, colon.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.420]   Your account will get a blue check mark just like the celebrities, companies, and politicians
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.840]   who already follow.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:46.040]   Speaking as a blue check mark person, I will be losing my blue check mark in three months.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.720]   So thank you very much.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.800]   Coming soon, half the ads ampersand much better ones.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   Right.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   Sure.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   Better ads.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:59.200]   Although advertisers are also like big accounts are pausing or leaving, some of them made
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.480]   the decision on the call with him as he was trying to calm advertisers down.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.360]   This is according to Kara Swisher.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.600]   The advertising community was kind of so turned off.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.520]   They were like, "Yeah, so we're going to pause our spend because we don't have any
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   person yet."
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.800]   Elon fired the person who liaised with these people.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   Oh no, she quit.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   Oh my God.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   She quit.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.960]   She basically said, "We're still committed to these things."
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.480]   Then I guess after two days she was like, "Actually, you know what?
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480]   Never mind."
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.800]   Then he flies to New York to meet with advertisers without her because she quit and takes the
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.840]   meeting himself.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:37.760]   Swisher was saying that people were saying in the meeting, Elon seemed distracted, unprepared,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:44.480]   just the usual kind of off the cuff BS, at which point advertisers literally paused the
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.760]   meeting, typed to their CMO, "Let's not buy any more ads for a little bit."
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.760]   Oh my God.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.920]   Half the ads, but much better ones according to this anonymous writer.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.360]   Since you're supporting Twitter in the battle against the bots, oh, I didn't know that's
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.900]   what the eight bucks did.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:06.520]   We're going to reward you with half the ads and make them twice as relevant.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.560]   Post longer videos.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.240]   You'll finally be able to post longer videos to Twitter.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.800]   By the way, there should be a dot, dot, dot.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   That's not in this update.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.920]   But we're going to do that eventually.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.920]   Priority ranking.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.720]   For quality content.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.240]   He said this, and I don't understand what that means.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.160]   Your content, if you pay eight bucks.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.160]   By the way, who's going to pay eight bucks?
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.160]   Kanye?
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.160]   Christina Warren.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   Christina Warren, absolutely.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   Are you going to pay eight bucks?
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160]   Absolutely.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   Really?
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   I already pay for Twitter Blue.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   I'm not going to unsubscribe.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.160]   That's three bucks.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.560]   I know, but then I think they changed the price.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.880]   I don't even know how much I pay.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880]   It's a ... Yes.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   It was $4.99.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.560]   Then it was $2.99, then it was $4.99, then it was $7.99.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.800]   I think I've been paying $3.99 or $2.99.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   I don't know.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   Yes, I will pay $8.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   $20 I might have.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   Rihanna?
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   $8, yes.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   $8?
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   I'm with Christina.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.040]   I already subscribed to Twitter Blue.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.920]   I've gotten so much out of Twitter for my career.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.360]   I'm there to go viral into its beneficial to my career and the things I want to do.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.760]   But isn't that where you were most attacked and Gamergate was on Twitter?
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   100%.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:14.640]   Twitter is the bane of my existence and it's also a critical tool for me to get through
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.800]   my day.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.840]   It's hard, but that algorithm ... Christina's on Twitter right now.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.520]   Look, I can't quit it.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   I'm sick.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   Can I just say something?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.440]   I want to say this in the kindest way.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   Sure.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   Possible.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.600]   You sound like Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   You're not wrong.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   You're not wrong.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.440]   You sound like cigarette addicts who ...
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   Bare.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440]   Bare.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.320]   You're not something that's bad, painfully bad for you.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:46.160]   You're not in any way wrong, but I also ... It is hilarious, awful, wonderful, amazing things
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.160]   happen.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   You just can't let it go.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.520]   Look, at a certain point, if the people who I'm on the platform for, which make it worth
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.640]   being on, go away.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.200]   If the culture goes away.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.080]   But just ridiculous, stupid things will happen that only happen on Twitter.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.280]   There is some cultural thing going on.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   There is a cultural thing going on.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:08.000]   And even now, as it's breaking down, the fact that it's happening on Twitter is in and of
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.120]   itself the car crash you can't turn away from.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:17.720]   As I've been joking, I will be playing near my god to thee as this goes down until it
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.200]   sinks into the sea.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.520]   You'll be dancing on the deck of the Titanic.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.760]   I have thoughts about this.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.560]   While I absolutely, I am very sad about everyone who has lost their job at Twitter, I do think
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:35.040]   there's something very special and interesting about a website that is fundamentally broken.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.420]   Twitter has been that in a lot of ways for many years, in ways that Twitter itself has
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.160]   been actively trying to fix when it comes to addressing harassment and misinformation
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.560]   and all of these incredibly important things that make the website more humane to be on.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.080]   However, as a person who is on Tumblr right now, a website that is fantastically broken
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:00.160]   and has a strange community that feels like they've been through something together, there's
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.600]   something in me that is excited for that era of Twitter.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.520]   Because I don't think it's going to die.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.300]   If it dies, it won't die right away.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.840]   The people who are in it for the long haul, like you, Christina, they're sticking around.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.760]   And until they go away, Twitter will continue to exist in some form or other.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.780]   And I think we're just going to see it evolve in strange and fascinating ways.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:29.560]   And I'm interested in that, not in a car crash kind of way, but in what happens to this community?
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   What does it turn into?
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.080]   And I think maybe it only becomes a problem because there are so many high profile people
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.840]   there and because there's so much potential for misinformation.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.320]   So it's not all fun and games, but I do think it's fascinating.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.980]   It is possible that it could technically fail if you fire half the people, if you don't
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.980]   fire the right half.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.400]   Oh, see, honestly, to me, I think that...
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.800]   So a week ago when this stuff happened, if you had asked me, "What are the chances of
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.160]   Twitter literally catching on fire and a lot of people moving off and dying very quickly?"
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.120]   I've been like, "Look, I'll see you all in two days."
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.120]   Everybody's moving to Massadon.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.160]   I'm like, "See you in five minutes."
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.800]   You're going to be back on in half an hour.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.880]   You're going to do the same thing that, as we were talking pre-show, all of us have done.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.560]   We sign up for these services.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.140]   We use them and then we go back to what we know.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:21.480]   But seeing how this was handled, seeing some of the changes that they claim they aren't
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.240]   making, but now there's no one to keep things running, knowing things that I've heard about
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.320]   how the internal code bases of Twitter has been handled, I do have very real questions
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.040]   of which is, "Is this site going to be able to remain up and where's the institutional
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.240]   knowledge and what's going to happen?"
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.320]   Even though they laid off fewer people on the trust and safety team, that doesn't mean
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.280]   that there aren't still other people on, "What are you doing to prevent fraud?"
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.480]   Like, "Lon says he wants to get rid of the bots, but are you employing the people who
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.560]   were going to do a good job with that, right?
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.080]   Or is this going to become overrun?"
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   So I don't know.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   I think that you're right.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.520]   I think there's a very real possibility that it could break down technologically.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.960]   I also think, and this is a total 180 from where I was a week ago, that it is much more
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.760]   likely that things could get worse much more quickly than I thought.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.640]   I really agree with that.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.440]   I was just going to say the midterms next week is where we're going to see that tested
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.920]   for the first time probably.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.080]   A hundred percent.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:28.600]   I think Twitter, just like Tesla, is facing a huge amount of competition.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.880]   I think TikTok really opened up the door that you could have people come in with a better
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.200]   product and get a real foothold.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.820]   But TikTok got a foothold by not just focusing on Gen Z, but by making it a pleasant place
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.820]   to spend time.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:50.600]   If you're on TikTok, there's not just this barrage of negativity that you get with Twitter.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.960]   I think if you had those half of people that quit at Twitter and they went and started
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:01.560]   something that was just like, "Look, Twitter as a technical product is utterly fungible,"
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.120]   and they said, "We are going to put trust and safety first.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.840]   That is our primary mission objective.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.760]   On top of that, we're going to verify the journalists and we're going to tweak the
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.360]   algorithm so it's more about broadcasting current events other than "tweet dunks on
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.360]   everybody."
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.760]   I think the real problem is Twitter is not a pleasant place to spend time.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.600]   It's a tool that all of us need.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.000]   For major events, it's a lot of fun.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.640]   There have been days on Twitter, it's just the best thing that's ever happened when someone
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   makes a huge mistake.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.680]   Do you remember the Will Smith slap thing?
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.160]   That was a great day on Twitter.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.760]   Do you guys remember the greatest day in the history of online, which was when the llamas
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:50.440]   escaped and then the dress happened?
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.840]   On the same day, the dress and the llamas.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   That was the greatest day in the history of online.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.520]   Twitter was amazing that day.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:04.960]   I think you guys have mush minds from watching too much Killigan's Island and eating too
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   much cotton candy.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   Definitely.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   That's a show that I've seen.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   This is garbage culture.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   Yes, it is.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   This is garbage culture.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   It is absolutely garbage.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   You're not good for you.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   You're not garbage people.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   No, but we are.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   No, you're not.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   You're not.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:25.320]   You deserve better than llamas escaping in blue gold dresses.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   You deserve better.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.200]   Have you listened to the show?
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.800]   Do you know how many episodes we've had on Anatelphi?
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.480]   Wait, I want to know what Leo's best day on Twitter was.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.480]   What was your best day on Twitter?
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   Do you have fond memories?
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   Oh no, I've had nothing but bad days on Twitter because in fact, one of the reasons I pulled
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.760]   back from Twitter was I realized, and I think some of you have not yet realized this, that
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   the only thing you can do on Twitter is get in trouble.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.200]   That it's very hard not to get in trouble because what happens is Twitter is designed to get you
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   in trouble.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.800]   What you put on Twitter feels like it's quick, it's fast, it's gone immediately, and it's
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.680]   not that it lives forever.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:09.840]   I think for most people, Twitter ends up being a dangerous place.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.360]   I include Elon Musk in this.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.320]   I include myself.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.800]   I stopped tweeting on Twitter because I got in a fight with somebody.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.840]   It really wraps you up and winds you up and you get in a fight.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.800]   Then a day later you go, "What have I done?"
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   You don't have those experiences.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.720]   No, you definitely do.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:34.880]   I will push back a little bit because all those things are accurate and are true.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.320]   This isn't exclusively true of Twitter.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.600]   This could be true of any other network where you can really build relationships with people.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:46.640]   I've genuinely met people like Micah Sargent who is in this room right now in the audience.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.280]   He and I are friends and started doing a podcast together and got to know each other because
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.280]   of Twitter.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   Brianna Wu, Simone de Rochefort and I, because of social networks.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.760]   I've built real relationships.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.040]   I've gotten jobs.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:03.120]   I've had really in-depth conversations with people that I would have never otherwise had
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.280]   a chance to meet even through things like Twitter Spaces.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.360]   When that debuted during the pandemic, I met a great group of people that I talk to all
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.160]   the time because of Animal Crossing and a Twitter DM group.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   There are people that I used.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160]   Some of them I worked with at Microsoft.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.080]   Some of them I didn't who we all got to know each other.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:25.200]   There are, I think, real community and relationship things that happen in addition to the fights.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.600]   I do agree with you that, yes, it probably is optimized to get you in trouble, but there
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.840]   are really good things that are part of this too.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.760]   Social networks are good for all that.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.800]   I agree.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.680]   I guess it wouldn't be as good if it were a small network.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.200]   You need some global network to meet people and to find affinity groups and all that.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.960]   I guess you have to have.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.200]   The problem, of course, with all social networks is the bigger they get, the more wild and
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.040]   unmanageable and problematic they get.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.440]   We've seen this again and again.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:02.680]   Once a small social network, we were talking before we began the show about prior failed
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.320]   social networks like Path or Pounce or Jaiku.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.240]   They were all great because they were small.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.000]   If they had gotten to the size of Twitter, they would have been as bad as Twitter, of
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.640]   course, or worse.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640]   There's probably a balance.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.880]   There probably is maybe that perfect spot when it's big enough to incorporate a bunch
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:26.400]   of different types of people, but not so big that it becomes assessable.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.960]   There's the problem because they're trying to make these websites continually bigger
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.000]   and bring more users so they can make money, which does make sense because websites need
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.880]   to make money.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.960]   I don't think anyone has properly solved the question of how do we continue growing and
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.520]   make this community global and enormous without making everyone be at each other's throats
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.520]   all the time.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.000]   Twitter probably did the best job, right?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.960]   Oh, the llama under the boat.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.200]   Yes, the llama day.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.000]   Oh my God, this was the greatest moment ever.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.760]   Twitter was set up to do a really good job with all these teams that have now been gutted.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.000]   Sorry, I'll let us watch the llama because we need to focus on this.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Most people are listening.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.460]   The rest of them are being distracted by the sight of a guy chasing a very adorable looking
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.840]   black llama around Sun City.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:17.240]   I do want to talk about llamas really because I think that they are one of the few mammals
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   that you can look into their eyes and see no love there, no understanding.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.300]   They are creatures that are full of disdain for you.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.320]   Has anyone ever met a loving llama?
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.120]   No, they spit.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   They're grouchy.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.680]   No, don't confuse a llama with a ... What's the cute one?
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   Alpacas.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   Alpacas.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   Because those are human.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   Yeah, those are really sweet.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.960]   Yeah, but llamas, no.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.160]   Llamas are ... Can I say asshole?
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.160]   No.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   No?
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   Okay.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.920]   Y'all, I've got some breaking news.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.360]   I have some breaking news.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.840]   Llamas have escaped.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:01.160]   Elon Musk has just tweeted that going forward, any Twitter handle engaging impersonation
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.800]   without clearly specifying their parody will be permanently suspended.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   You know why he said that?
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.120]   Because everyone's ... Because everybody's becoming Elon Musk.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.080]   Everyone is renaming it.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.360]   And I just, I got to say, this is the hypocrisy of this dude.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.400]   It's like he says he wants free speech and then people are ... He's the butt of the joke
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   and that's when he shuts it down.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:30.240]   Everybody's been testing content moderation by changing not their Twitter handle, but
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:38.200]   their nick to Elon Musk, adding a blue check, putting the same picture and then saying outrageous
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   things.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.960]   And apparently they've gotten under the skin of Elon and now he said, "Well, no, that's
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.080]   not going to happen."
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.320]   And this is going to be exactly the problem.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.260]   This is really Elon's fiefdom.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.560]   So there's two things that Elon could do with Twitter.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.560]   Try to get his money back.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.940]   Not going to happen.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.940]   But he could try.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.940]   Polish it up.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.320]   Turn it into something that maybe investors might say, "Oh, this is the new Twitter."
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.960]   Call the private equity people in.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   I don't think private equity.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   I think IPO.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.480]   Because there are more dumb people in IPO than private equity.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   Oh, no.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   He's already got private equity.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.720]   He's got $13 billion and he's got a billion dollar a year VIG.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:15.720]   No, I'm just thinking if he wants to get out of this as soon as possible.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   Nobody's going to buy it from him.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   This was the whole problem.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   Twitter would try for...
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   What if we buy it?
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   Well, yeah.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.280]   Twitter had been trying to sell itself for years and nobody would buy it.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.280]   Along comes this cuckoo billionaire.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.960]   I'll give you 44 billion.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   What?
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   Okay, sure.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   Nobody's going to...
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.040]   So maybe polish the turd and IPO's.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:43.720]   Or maybe he really wants the influence, the power that Twitter could give him.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.640]   Certainly gave Donald Trump the presidency, right?
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   Sure.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.280]   Although I think there's a question to then be had, which is does that influence remain
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.600]   if it turns into...
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:58.160]   If all the people and the programs that made it what it is, if they go away and if it becomes
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   this fiefdom...
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.160]   No, but he's Philip Morris.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   He's got you guys hooked already.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.800]   So all he has to do is keep feeding you the Nick and you're going to stay on.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.000]   Well, we're hooked, but at the same time, I will say, like, but genuinely, and I say this
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.880]   to somebody who I just said I'm going to go down with the Titanic with this thing.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:17.480]   I will, but I'm also going to add a caveat with that, which is that if people that I
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:22.080]   get a good experience with, and I'm not talking about the good experience of when we all are
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.600]   mad at someone, but like the genuinely good experiences, if that goes away, I might still
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.680]   check in, but I'm not going to be active, right?
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.840]   That's a different sort of thing.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   I mean, I still read it.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   Right.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   But that still means it has influence.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.840]   You're a journalist.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.840]   Well, you're not a journalist anymore, but you were.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   Well, yeah, right.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.840]   Sure.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.840]   Lots of journalists.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.840]   They will read it.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.840]   They will amplify.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   The New York Times will still publish tweets.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.320]   Well, I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.400]   I think we'll see because if the people that would be doing notable things go away, if
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.640]   it's just his echo chamber, then I don't know.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.440]   I don't know if the culture remains the same.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.440]   Well, he's screwed.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.160]   If that happens, he can't polish the turd and sell it, and he won't have any influence,
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   and he's really out of luck.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:06.560]   Then Neil Ipatel is correct, and he's entered his own impossible Hobson's choice.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   It's a hellscape.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.600]   I genuinely believe some team is going to come forward and they're going to do the things
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:18.400]   that the reasonable people on Twitter have been asking for for years.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:24.760]   Better trust and safety, more transparent policies, lowering the toxicity, tweaking
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:30.440]   the algorithm so it's less about outrage and more about positive conversation.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.040]   There is definitely a space for a product like that.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.440]   I think journalists, generally speaking, are interested in getting their stories out to
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.160]   people and looking at sources.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:46.400]   I think that the credible people that Twitter is basically provide the content that makes
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.080]   Twitter worthwhile, I think increasingly they're going to look at the way Elon is running this
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.920]   thing and they're going to be looking for alternatives.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.440]   I think there is ample space for a competitor there.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440]   There is no one yet though, right?
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.200]   There's nobody that's a reasonable competitor.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.200]   No.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.200]   Not in the text space.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   Not Facebook.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:09.400]   I do want to say, I signed up for Mastodon on a whim and look, we've criticized it plenty
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.720]   on our show.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.840]   It is hard to access the onboarding, gets an F minus, but I have to say the conversations
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:22.880]   I'm having on there because of the technical barrier to signing up for it, it's like app.net
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   again.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   It's...
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880]   Oh yeah?
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   It's very technical.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   We've run a Mastodon.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.640]   You didn't know this, but we've run a Mastodon instance for some years, twit.social.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.840]   I've been really impressed with it so far.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.200]   I'm a little nervous about actually enticing people from Twitter to come over.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.640]   I don't want it to turn into the next Twitter.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.040]   I think that would be...
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.840]   In fact, I've kind of tell people, "Tone it down.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.480]   This isn't the same place.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.920]   Get to know the culture before you start doing the same stuff."
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.200]   I'm a little nervous actually about Mastodon attempting to become Twitter.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.640]   It has some structural things that will keep it from that.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.920]   The federation is great.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.160]   I run an instance, you run an instance.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.360]   They run an instance.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.480]   You can block instances you don't like.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.480]   You can choose who to follow.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.000]   You can have different rules.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.400]   In a way, you could do what I was saying, which is create a small, kind of more personal
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.680]   space that still connects to a larger global space.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.000]   That's what Blue Sky, by the way, Jack Dorsey's attempt to create a federated Twitter is all
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   about.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.120]   Do you think Blue Sky is going to come along and be a replacement?
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   I signed up for the beta.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   I don't have an invite yet.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   Same.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.200]   I don't have an invite either.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.120]   I was mean to Jack Dorsey on Twitter yesterday, so I probably won't be here early.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.320]   What did you say to Jack?
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   You picked a fight with me.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.320]   I would fight.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.720]   Jack said, "I grew it too fast.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.120]   It's my fault."
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.640]   I basically said that that was a little too late for the thousands of people that were
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.640]   laid off.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.280]   By the way, Jack has a massive stake still in Elon's Twitter.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   I know he does.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   I know he does.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:58.040]   Anyway, I hope ... Look, I think that things like Blue Sky and Mastodon and others have
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.040]   a lot of potential.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.800]   I don't think Jack was wrong when he said that he'd wish that Twitter had always been
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   a protocol.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:10.160]   I do feel like that's a little bit of false, looking back.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.120]   What he's saying doesn't really match with the reality of what his decisions were when
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.920]   he was CEO of Twitter both times, because he made decisions ...
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   A lot of revisionist history.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   That's the word I was looking for.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.960]   He has a lot of revisionist history.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:27.460]   I'm not opposed to those things in theory, but the challenge you'll still have is even
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:33.120]   though you can have these multiple instances, there will be one instance that becomes the
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.460]   centralized place.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.440]   Just like with anything else, there will be a centralized hub.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.440]   There has to be, right?
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   Always.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.940]   Same thing with Bitcoin, right?
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.940]   Coinbase and Binance.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.940]   It always happens.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.940]   Always.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.940]   For NFTs, it was OpenSea.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:45.940]   It always happens.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.940]   Exactly.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:52.120]   The problem with that is that once something becomes the de facto home or the largest place,
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.720]   you still face the same challenges that you would face if it was Twitter, with how do
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   we moderate?
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.840]   How do we enforce things?
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.840]   How do we grow?
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:05.440]   How do we keep different opinions without allowing harassment?
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.880]   Do we have to have somewhere like that?
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   I don't know.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.880]   What do they call it?
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.920]   The public square.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.280]   I don't know if Twitter is the public square.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.820]   It's the closest thing to the public square I guess we have.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.840]   We used to have Walter Cronkite, right?
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.280]   We used to do three television networks.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:26.040]   Everybody watched the same TV shows, so there was this certain community within the US ...
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.120]   And there was a certain hegemony too, right?
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:34.160]   Well, it was bad because obviously it was CB ... If you watched Walter Cronkite, he
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:40.360]   famously was the guy who ended the Vietnam War because he lost faith in President Johnson's
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   plans in Vietnam.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.240]   And he said it on his broadcast, and that was that.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.800]   Uncle Walter said it's a bad idea.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.360]   Everybody changed their mind.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.080]   Protests had gone on for years.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   I marched in them.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.720]   It was a big deal.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.760]   Everyone changed America until Uncle Walter said so.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.760]   We don't have that anymore.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.720]   We don't have a central place.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.840]   Do we need one?
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:16.780]   I am torn because obviously I dislike the idea of any particular organization like holding
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.740]   the keys to America's psyche.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.600]   On the other hand, what we have seen over the internet over the last 10 years or so is just
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:31.360]   a fracturing into different realities where you can completely curate what you believe
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:38.280]   and ignore ... Curate the facts that you're ingesting.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.880]   I don't have anything positive to say about that.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   I don't really see ... I don't know.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.400]   Do you think that's a result of this lack of centrality that now we've got QAnon believers
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.400]   and there's no reason for that?
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   Who gets to decide what the central reality is?
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.640]   It was a big corporation that decided that.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.240]   That's obviously not ... Maybe it's going to be a guy like Elon Musk that's going to
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.240]   decide that.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.240]   That's probably not what we want.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.320]   Is Walter Cronkite still alive and if not, could we resurrect him?
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   Let's think about that.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.040]   I could do a pretty good Walter Cronkite.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.040]   Maybe I'll do that.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.040]   Okay.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.040]   Whoa.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.040]   Walter Cronkite, deep fake.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   I just fixed America.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.040]   Oh my gosh.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   You're welcome.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.040]   You did just fix America.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.440]   I understand though, that's why a certain generation is terrified of TikTok because they're afraid
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.400]   that TikTok could become that centrality, that our beliefs could come from TikTok.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   Absolutely.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.720]   I completely agree.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.440]   I think we have a TikTok story today that we're going to talk about.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   Okay.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.840]   There's a phrase that flies around on the internet now, which is like, "Our parents
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.880]   were radicalized by Fox News.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.880]   Gen Z is being radicalized by TikTok."
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.680]   I think in some ways that's true.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.240]   I like TikTok as a platform.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.000]   I think there's a lot of good stuff on TikTok, but it's true that there are large parts of
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.920]   the population that are getting news and other recommendations from TikTok from people who
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.120]   are incentivized to make the loudest and most divisive content possible.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.160]   And that's another problem that I don't have an answer to.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   Is it the Chinese Communist Party though, that's doing that?
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.160]   No, it's not.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.160]   It's not.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   The call is coming from inside the house.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   It's coming from inside the house.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   It's us.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   I agree.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   I don't necessarily agree with that.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   That's exactly right.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.920]   I don't necessarily agree with that.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:24.080]   I mean, I think if you want to zoom out and look at this issue from 30,000 feet, we are
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:29.440]   in a global information war that's taking place every single second of every single
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.360]   day and we are losing that war.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.920]   Who's we?
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.360]   We meaning democracy.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:42.400]   It is so, the incentives on social media is exactly as profitable for Facebook and
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:49.360]   Twitter and Reddit and YouTube to pump out false information as it is true information.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.200]   There's nothing there to fact check it.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.880]   And because of that, you have these strongmen all around the world that are weaponizing
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.560]   these incentives and our ideals against us.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:05.160]   I mean, democracies fundamentally depend on a free flow of information so people can
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   make decisions.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:12.720]   We have so much garbage in the zone today because of what are essentially information
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.080]   weapons factories that I mean, this is why it's not just the United States struggling
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   with this.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.520]   Point to a democracy.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.320]   We're all struggling with this.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.040]   And I think, I mean, I've been saying this for years, Christina, I disagree on it, but
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.800]   I think you've got to aggressively regulate social media.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:35.140]   I think there has got to be some question at some point, is this good for national unity?
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.640]   Is it good for democracy?
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:41.160]   But isn't that what the US Territorians are doing is regulating social media in their
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.160]   countries?
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.840]   Because there's a way to...
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.760]   The regulation we like isn't going to align with the regulation that another administration
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.600]   might like even in our own country.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.080]   That's my fear with that.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.560]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.880]   I understand the conflict.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.160]   And you're right, the only way we as a society have of exerting our will is through government
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.560]   and law.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:09.280]   But that seems to... Brianna, I think it feels like it's failed.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.200]   And it's in the process of falling apart.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:17.440]   And so you can't be sure which government is going to do that.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.600]   And as a result, I mean, I don't think the corporations should do it either.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.680]   I don't know if there's an answer.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   That's the problem.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   Turn off the internet.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.200]   Scott, so I'm not saying I agree with this necessarily, but Scott Galloway had a really
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.160]   interesting piece out last week.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.160]   I'm not made up of...
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.160]   He's on Mastodon now.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.640]   Let me check his Mastodon account here real quick.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.860]   So he was talking about how one of the ways we've combated the financing of terrorism
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.840]   around the world is through know your customer laws.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:52.040]   And he was talking about how maybe it's time for social media companies to know their customer.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.240]   It's not saying you have to use your real name.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.920]   It's not saying they're going to out you.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:00.720]   It's saying that there's some check along the way to make sure that you're a real authentic
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.720]   person there.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.880]   I'm interested in that idea.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.040]   I don't agree with this premise that, look, it's complicated.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.080]   It's difficult for free speech.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.640]   Anyone that understands this issue agrees with that.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.200]   But I don't agree that the best course, the wisest course of action is to continue doing
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   nothing.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.800]   We are F'd if we stay in this course and we've got to try something.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.360]   That's fair as well.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.520]   But a real names policy isn't going to do everything.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   Not real name.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.160]   Know your customer.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.960]   So making sure that there is a real person behind that account at some point.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   We do that on our socials.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.200]   We allow handles.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.320]   And I don't go out and verify people, but we kind of pay attention to who you are and
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   where you come from and stuff.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.680]   So we know there's a real person.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.120]   I'm not against bots, by the way.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.120]   I have bots on Twitter.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.880]   Yeah, I think the bots can have value.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:01.280]   There's a difference between spam, which is really what he's talking about, and bots,
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.200]   which can have a specific purpose.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.120]   And influence bots, which are created by Russian troll farms, for instance.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.120]   Fair, fair, right?
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.720]   There are thousands of accounts created by...
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   Yes.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.960]   I don't think Alon cares about those at all.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.960]   Oh, he doesn't care about that.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.160]   What he cares about are the spam ones that are making things unpleasant for him.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.800]   Spam's easy to get rid of.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   It's not illegal.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   Right.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.840]   You don't do it by law, but I filter spam on our Mastodon account.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:32.320]   If I see spam, I cancel the person very happily.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.080]   Oh my God.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.080]   Leah Laporte, pro cancel culture.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.080]   I chose that word intentionally.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.080]   Unbelievable.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.480]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.120]   This is fun.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.780]   This is better than being on Rocket.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:46.920]   This is with Rocket.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.160]   It is Rocket meets Twit.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.320]   Simone de Rochefort, Brianna Wu, Christina Warren in the house.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.440]   I got something you're going to want.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.480]   This is an advertiser called OnLogic.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.240]   Look at this.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.240]   This is the cutest little thing.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.240]   What do you think?
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.240]   That's a computer.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   It's adorable.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.840]   This is an industrial computer.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.200]   You are...
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.880]   So this is what's changing in the world, right?
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.640]   It's not a one desktop, one computer world anymore, right?
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   It's computing at the edge.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.560]   It's computing everywhere.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.640]   OnLogic makes computers you don't even see.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:27.080]   An entire hidden world of computing that's changing everything from sustainable agriculture,
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:33.800]   smart cities, in factories everywhere, increasing manufacturing efficiency.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:39.760]   That's where you'll find OnLogic's distinctive orange industrial and embedded computers.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.520]   These are amazing.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   No fan in here.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.780]   You see all the fins on it.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.400]   It's a passive cooling.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.520]   This thing, you could throw this a hundred yards.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.400]   Your quarterback, what's his name?
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.840]   Simone could throw this.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.600]   I don't know if Kenny threw a hundred yards.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   He could throw this.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.760]   He could throw this, bounce it down the field.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.600]   Absolutely no problem.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.800]   OnLogic is the first choice.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.040]   Here's another one.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.200]   In industrial computing for innovators around the world who need computing power that can
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.360]   survive and thrive where traditional hardware might fail.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360]   Look at this.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.020]   I've got six Wi-Fi choices on here.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.600]   That's because I'm in a factory, right?
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.760]   With multiple Wi-Fi access points.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.040]   OnLogic designs and creates computing solutions that can fit in the palm of your hand while
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.880]   powering everything from advanced robotics and AI to manufacturing automation to digital
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.740]   media solutions, smart agriculture technologies.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.080]   These are passively cooled.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.940]   They're ventless in some cases, so no dust, no dirt.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.420]   They're engineered for reliability.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.200]   No airborne contaminants can get in.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:47.160]   They've removed the fan, so it's a completely solid state device.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   Bang it around.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Be great for a truck, right?
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   It doesn't matter.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.840]   Shock and vibration do nothing.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.800]   Other design features and specialized components protect systems from extreme temperatures
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.520]   and interference.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.600]   These are just two examples.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:04.920]   There's an OnLogic for whatever need, whatever IoT or an industrial or embedded system you
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.160]   need.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.600]   They run all kinds of processors.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.880]   They're extensively tested to operate reliably wherever they are.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.640]   A remote mining operation.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.280]   I don't hope you don't see it, but you might see this on a crash cart in a hospital.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:25.440]   OnLogic extensively tested to operate reliably no matter what.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:31.600]   The team at OnLogic is so committed to making a product that is tailored to your unique
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.600]   challenge.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.020]   They love that challenge.
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.920]   They can't wait to hear from you.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:41.480]   They partner with leading software companies like AWS to enable rapid evaluation and deployment
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.360]   of edge computing solutions.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:50.360]   They have in fact a line of AWS IoT Greengrass compatible computers approved and vetted by
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.880]   AWS.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.080]   So for Greengrass, what a great solution.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.280]   It gives you the peace of mind that's going to work right out of the box.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.280]   It's certified.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.600]   If you need a computing solution that can easily be configured to your particular needs,
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.920]   supported by industry experts who are just a phone call, a website chat or email away,
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:12.480]   delivered to you quickly, the team at OnLogic is ready to help.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:16.000]   I love these guys.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.520]   I'm sure they're going to want these back, but I can think of so many things that we
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.640]   could do with this.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   Just so cool.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   I wish you could, it's built like a brick, right?
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:35.080]   OnLogic to get started, learn more about OnLogic's 30 day risk-free hardware trial, visit OnLogic.com/twit.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.080]   OnLogic.com/twit.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:42.960]   I'm a little weird, but this is the kind of thing that gets me drooling.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.200]   I just go, "Oh, it's so cool.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.000]   Oh, I can think of all sorts of things we could do with these."
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.660]   Thank you OnLogic for your support.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:54.720]   You're supporting Twit by the way by using that address, so make sure you do it.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.720]   OnLogic.com/twit.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.720]   Enough Twitter.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   Never, right?
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.720]   Never, never, never.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   We want more Twitter.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   No, I think we're done.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   That's what we want.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   We want more Twitter.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.720]   never, we want more Twitter.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.720]   No, I think we're, yeah.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.720]   We Twittered out?
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.880]   We might be, especially now that he's ... All the Twitter is right now is just everyone
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.320]   changing their handle to Elon Musk since he said that he's going to ban impersonations.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.800]   Oh, is it now spreading?
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   Yes.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   Oh, Elon.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.680]   How ... Kate, let's take some bets.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.240]   How long before you start feeling sorry for poor Elno?
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.240]   Never.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.240]   I know.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.240]   Never.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.240]   He's a billionaire.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.240]   Never.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.400]   If I was a billionaire, do you think I would ever tweet?
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.400]   Ever?
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:42.120]   I mean, I'd be on the spaceship to Mars every weekend.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.720]   Here's the thing.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:51.880]   We underestimate how much fame and fortune disturbs the human mind, but we've got lots
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.200]   of evidence of it.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   We do.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.840]   There's very few exceptions.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.360]   Taylor Swift is an exception.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:03.100]   She seems like a real great normal person who survived her fame, but then for every
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:08.720]   Taylor Swift there's a Justin Bieber or a Madonna or on and on and on.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.480]   Poor Lady Gaga, I'm sure driven mad by her fame and fortune.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.240]   It's just not a natural thing.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.800]   I think very few people in the three-coma club have survived that.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:24.840]   It has to be hard when you have so many people who want things from you and are willing to
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:32.280]   tell you so many things you want to hear and you're treated so differently.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.000]   Many billionaires and Elon's in this group think they're a genius because they're a
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   billionaire.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Right.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.320]   Well, he is a very smart guy, but there are smart people, as I think we've all probably
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.560]   experienced this, who overestimate their intelligence and think that because I'm very smart about
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.200]   one thing, that means that I know everything about everything.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.840]   Is that the Dunning-Kruger effect?
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.840]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.640]   Or you think you're smarter than you are.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:58.200]   I saw a study in Harvard Business Review that I always think of when this comes up.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:04.800]   They looked at the ultra wealthy and what happens to your brain when the physical concerns
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.760]   of the world are no longer something you have to stress on a daily basis.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.240]   Oh, you're at the top of Maslow's pyramid.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.000]   So life is great.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.640]   You're going to self-actuate by becoming an edgelord?
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:24.040]   What they found is in all of these cases or many of these cases, the very skills that
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:29.040]   made you successful in the first place, like the ability to read people, the ability to
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:36.200]   understand people, the ability to sense discomfort, the skills that help you get a footing in
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   life, those become eroded 100%.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:47.320]   You're unable to sense people's emotions and you become narcissistic at the same time.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.440]   You no longer have sympathy.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.880]   I would simply buy a Formula One team.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.360]   Yeah, you would.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.960]   Would you try to run the team, Simone?
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   No.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.960]   This is the question.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:58.960]   Well, depends on how rich I am, right?
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:54:59.960]   But you'd hang out in the pit.
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.960]   I know you would.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.960]   I know you would.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.120]   But if you're rich enough to own the team and you're rich enough to buy it, would you
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.080]   then go to the place where you're like, "Well, I'm going to run this the way I want," or do
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.040]   you hire someone else and trust them to do it?
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.040]   That's the thing.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.440]   I start off hiring someone to run it myself, but as I become more and more wealthy, my ability
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.600]   to discern the truth erodes and then I say, "I'm going to run the team."
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.600]   Right.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   So you become the problem.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.600]   Ten years later, I am the problem.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.600]   That's what happened to Toto.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   No!
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   Oh my God.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   Don't even slander Toto Wolf in front of me.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.600]   I just yelled.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.600]   I think I've...
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.600]   No.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.600]   I think you broke her.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   A little bit.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.600]   I love this.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   I think you broke her.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:46.400]   Mercedes problems this year, I think, are entirely the results of some of their time
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.800]   as top engineers not having the time to work on the car and then also the decreased arrow
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   time.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.960]   So I think they're going to come back in 2023 with a good car.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.160]   What happened to Ferrari though?
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.160]   Oh!
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.200]   What hasn't happened?
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   That's just being Italian.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   Now I'm playing to the crowd, aren't I?
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   I'm winding her up.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   You are.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   This is so good.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   I'm enjoying this so much.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:18.400]   I think that knowledge of F1 could come in handy later, Liam.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.720]   When do you want to do whatever this thing is that you're going to do?
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.360]   I'm ready for it now if you are.
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.800]   Let's save it for after the next break.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   How about that?
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:28.040]   Because I have a few more things to talk about.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.040]   Damn.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.040]   Oh yeah?
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.040]   Did you?
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.160]   By the way, okay, who's an expert in League of Legends?
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.520]   Not me, unfortunately, but I'm ready to talk about it.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.560]   You guys are gamers, so I know you know.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.400]   So the big event was here in San Francisco, the Chase Center.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.560]   What do they call it?
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   The World?
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   The World?
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.560]   I don't know.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   They have a special name for it.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   Worlds.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.560]   Just Worlds.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   That's all.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:52.560]   Just Worlds.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.560]   Apparently, Benito is a LOL fan.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.560]   Did you?
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.560]   Oh, this was your beat.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:59.880]   Yeah, because you were at Twitch, right?
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:03.440]   So I'm very fascinated by esports.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:11.680]   Certainly because my generation, I'm an old man, my generation, we're the Walter Cronkite
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.680]   generation.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.120]   We watched baseball for crying out loud.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.200]   Before it was broken.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   I don't know.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   I think it was always that way.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.600]   It's very slow.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:29.840]   I think that there's a whole generation under 30 that doesn't know or care anything about
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.160]   nightly news.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:36.200]   Or even the NFL or F1.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:41.600]   This generation is much more interested in YouTube and Twitch and TikTok.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.580]   And I think esports is very, very interesting.
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:52.600]   And I think many, many networks, the Worlds were sponsored by MasterCard.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:57.800]   The big event was at Chase Center, which is a massive, it's where the Warriors play, I
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:02.240]   think 20 or 30,000 people there.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.600]   Benito did you watch the opening ceremony?
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.480]   Oh my God.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:12.800]   I had not, apparently they do this every year.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:19.680]   There was a big deal because they hadn't been able to gather in person for a couple of years.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.680]   Right.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.000]   Which, that's what- Can I play this or am I going to get in trouble?
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.640]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.440]   You can edit it out later.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.240]   So John, this is where we saw Roger Waters just a month ago.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.840]   So we know the kind of arena, they did the similar thing they had, I'll turn off the
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.240]   audio but except the audio is kind of the fun part.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.320]   I don't know.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.240]   So this is a giant arena.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:50.560]   They have a screen that is covering up hiding where the gaming is going to occur.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.140]   They're doing a countdown.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:57.200]   They have three major celebrities to sing the song.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.960]   At the end Lil Nas X shows up.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.160]   Of course.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:09.500]   And then flies out of the arena in the palm of a hand of a giant mech.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:14.360]   I mean this is like the Olympics opening ceremony.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   Totally.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.040]   With, I saw the stats.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:21.620]   I mean they have something like 40, 30K projectors.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:23.920]   They have hundreds of cameras.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.500]   They have holographic projection.
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:29.240]   They have a real live musical audience.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.200]   I mean a musical orchestra.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.160]   This is a big deal.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:37.120]   And it kind of blew me away when I, I'll skip ahead a little bit.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.120]   They've got dancers.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.680]   Yeah, no it's a whole thing.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:43.720]   Wait till the team is, the teams are going to show up which is hysterical because the
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.800]   funny thing is these guys are still six absolute nerds.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.900]   Right.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:54.520]   I think the team rises up out of the stage here and shows up.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:59.560]   Let me, let me scoot, scoot your head a little bit to the, I don't know, maybe I've, maybe
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   I've gone past.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.560]   Yo, here they are.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.560]   Here's the nerds.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:09.680]   And what they're trying to do obviously is turn these guys who have probably very little
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:16.240]   social acumen into, but probably F1 drivers are equally nerdy.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.720]   Actually though I would push back on that a little bit.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.520]   None of these streamers, some of these e-sports guys have, they're pretty sharp and they're
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.960]   on Twitch all the time and they have personalities and they've built brands for themselves.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.720]   Not all of them, but many of them and many of those teams similar to the way that like
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   you have the one kind of charismatic, you know, F1, you know, maybe, you know, member
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   of the team.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.120]   Yeah, you don't get to be an F1 driver unless besides being the great driver you have, you're
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.120]   gorgeous.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120]   You're gorgeous.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120]   Come on.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]   You have daddy's money.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.400]   Or you're Lando Norris.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.360]   But if, but it doesn't.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:48.120]   Because a brand has to be built behind you, right? Because this is, this is more than
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.840]   just like it, you know, the same with any sort of sport, right?
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.800]   Like you have to have a total package.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.200]   I guess, you know, I guess, you know, I've watched the world series.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.640]   Some of these baseball players were disgusting actually, literally.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.960]   This is why baseball is dying.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:09.360]   So this is Lil Nas X singing a song that he wrote specifically for League of Legends
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.200]   Worlds.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.160]   I should turn this off because this will definitely take it.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.160]   It's taken down.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.160]   Let's see if I can go to the...
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   That's rocks.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   It's amazing.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.160]   This is amazing.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.160]   There were five million.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.360]   Yeah, I want to see the mech.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.080]   I think peak viewers, like five million peak people were tuned in to this at one time.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080]   Oh yeah.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.800]   They released a new trophy, which is like when they show it for the first time, the
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.840]   crowd is obviously totally tuned in.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.260]   Oh, they go, "Oh my God."
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.260]   Totally tuned into this.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.400]   Oh, that's the new trophy.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.560]   It's really kind of, I was blown away.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.720]   But this is a subculture, right?
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   Still.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   Yes.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.680]   So this is kind of a continuation of the question earlier.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:59.200]   Is there going to be an NFL in 20 years, a central sport that we all follow, or is it
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200]   going to be fragmented?
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.960]   Because people who follow, I don't know, what's the other game?
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:10.320]   Dota, or Counter-Strike, or Dota, or Overwatch, are they caring about League of Legends?
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.800]   You have to watch these...
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.200]   There he goes, there's Lil Nas X going up into the roof on a giant mech hand, which actually
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.440]   is just projected on here.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.040]   But still, that's pretty cool.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040]   That's awesome.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040]   That's pretty cool.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.680]   I think it's always going to be fragmented in a way that's just not what normal...
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.680]   Gaming is much more fragmented, isn't it?
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.440]   It is, because you're always going to have a new developer coming out trying to put a
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.320]   product to market that's just going to push things forward.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   I'm sorry, I have to correct myself.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.440]   I slimed Lando Nars.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.120]   I meant Lance Stroll, obviously.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.640]   Lando Nars also comes from money.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.280]   I was surprised that you didn't go to Lance first.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.280]   I didn't say Nikita Mazepin, which could have been really the...
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.080]   I'm sorry, go ahead, please continue.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:03:00.600]   I was just going to say, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, which is essentially a big dumb movie.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.960]   I'm sorry, those campaigns are great.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.440]   Modern Warfare 2, the new one?
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.240]   Modern Warfare 2, the remake, reboot, or whatever you want to call it.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.720]   That made $800 million last week.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.960]   That's Avengers endgame level money, 100%.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.520]   This is huge business.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:22.800]   If you're looking at League of Legends, don't look at this as like an extravagant, silly
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   thing they're putting on.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   This is big business.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   No, I can see that.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   Keeping people hyped up.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.120]   One of the reasons I spend so much time speed running to the point where I have a PVM that
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.800]   I bought, a nice 20 inch PVM.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:44.040]   One of the reasons I spend so much time speed running is that is exploding as a legitimate
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040]   sport.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.040]   Oh, interesting.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.480]   I'm trying first spot with GDQ, Game's Done Quick, which is the Super Bowl speed running
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   very soon.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.400]   I have an excellent shot of getting in.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.680]   So I think all these esports, it's always going to be more fragmented than, you know,
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.120]   pick football, baseball, basketball.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.280]   It's never going to be like that, but there's certainly going to be these towers where you
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.520]   have real competitors people respect.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:14.440]   Will the NFL continue to be dominant in the next few decades?
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.160]   I would not bet against it.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.440]   I think the NFL puts a lot of money into things.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.800]   What's interesting about the NFL, like basketball has become a very international sport.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   The NFL is trying, right?
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   They're trying, right?
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.600]   The NFL is trying, but it hasn't really gone that way.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.520]   It hasn't had to, to be frank, but there's still something compelling about it.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.520]   I think it depends.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.680]   I think that if things aren't handled right, it could fall off, but I would not bet against
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:43.280]   them because they're still, even when you look at the ratings now, which are down, like
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.160]   honestly, the worst thing the NFL could do would probably be to do more things like the
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.760]   Amazon Prime, you know, deal.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.240]   You think that was bad for them?
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   I do.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.320]   Because they, I'm sure, saw this as a way forward in the future.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   I'm sure they did.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.820]   And I think they will need to do things like that in the future.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:00.560]   But I think that siloing the thing into saying only people who are part of this can watch,
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560]   I think that's the problem.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.200]   I think that they probably would need to syndicate across some of those services.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   It was surprising.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.840]   Like you have to have Amazon Prime to watch a football game.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840]   Exactly.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.840]   Which is different.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   That's the thing.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.320]   It's kind of what we were talking about with Twitter Blue and paying for a check mark.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.440]   Like it's hard to ask somebody to pay for something that they're used to see it, to
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.920]   having it in a totally different context.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:25.080]   Especially when the NFL also offers Sunday night tickets and other sorts of, you know,
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.720]   premium products for people to get more games if that's what they want and to see more things.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.600]   I think that then when you say we're going to put this one game, it's one thing if it's
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   on ESPN, right?
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:41.840]   Or if it's on Fox or ABC, you can make kind of, you know, you can make the calculus there.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.480]   But then to say I have to be on this specific streaming service, I don't know.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.080]   There is a little struggle going on right now between Apple and the NFL.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:55.080]   Apple wanted the Sunday ticket, which is a thing Direct TV currently has.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.040]   A billion and a half dollars they spent for this.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.600]   They lost their shirt on it, by the way.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   They didn't make any money.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.240]   So they said we're not going to, we're not going to bid for this again.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:08.000]   Apple, Google, Amazon all have deep pockets from other sources so they can afford to spend
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.880]   a billion and a half a year or two billion a year on this thing, which is basically it's
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.400]   the Sunday games.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.800]   So you can watch any game.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.800]   Yes.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   Unless it's in your markets.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.800]   Like there are a couple of exceptions.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.680]   This is another thing that screws itself.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.680]   Yes.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.280]   And now that they have a streaming app and now I think that's where maybe you could get
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280]   better.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.040]   They're going down to certain broadcast licensing things, but that those are things they'll
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.040]   need to overcome.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:35.640]   I think if they want to survive in the decades will be to get out of their own way.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.640]   They could mess it up.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.640]   They could mess it up.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:41.920]   But if they don't fix that, I don't think that I think, I think that the game is compelling
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.440]   enough and has a long large enough of a fan base that people would continue to be into
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.440]   football.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.040]   The battle between NFL and Apple is rumored to be, and we don't know exactly what's going
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.040]   on.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.640]   Certainly Apple's offered them as much money as they could ever dream of, but the battle
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:01.960]   apparently according to sources is that the NFL doesn't want to give up control.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:05.680]   Apple wants to be able to do more and interesting things as they should.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.680]   Right?
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.680]   They're a technology company.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:08.680]   They want to play with streaming.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.400]   This could be very good for Apple TV plus.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.800]   And the NFL says, well, I don't know.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800]   I don't know.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.400]   And the NFL is going, wait, this is our brand.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400]   Right?
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.920]   So you have two control freak organizations going head to head with one another.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.440]   And Major League Soccer said Apple do whatever you want.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.440]   Absolutely.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.800]   Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball has made some.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.800]   Nobody watches it over here.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:30.640]   But football and part of the reason you could argue that the NFL has been so dominant in
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.280]   American sports over the last 30 years is because the league has had such control for
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280]   everything.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.000]   But you know, golf used to be big.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.800]   Golf used to be the biggest thing growing thing.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   It's gone.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800]   But.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   Baseball, I have to say, after watching the World Series, I don't have much hope that
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.040]   Major League Baseball has much future.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.480]   But you know, Formula One is doing great.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480]   Formula One's coming up.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   By the way.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.360]   I'll ask Simone this, who waved the checker flag in Austin?
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:01.400]   Tim, Timothy Cook, Tim Cook, Mr. Tim Cook.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400]   Watching Crofty.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   So badly.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.400]   Doing a play by play on ESPN.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.000]   It's lights out in Austin.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.120]   And then there's a picture of Ed Sheeran talking to somebody from F1.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.760]   He said, that's Ed Sheeran talking to somebody from F1.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.960]   But he didn't know that standing in between them was Eddie Q. I'm going, yeah.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   And.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.960]   Oh, no.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.960]   And.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.760]   But Apple was there in force.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.960]   And I don't think Apple was there by accident.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   No.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   It was the same day ESPN announced that maybe they do have a documentary coming out of Apple
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.960]   TV+.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.040]   I think Apple was also saying, we could help you guys.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   We could.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040]   100%.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   We could do something with this.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.840]   And it's a very technical sport.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:41.840]   It is a very technical sport.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.760]   It would be a lot of great things you could do with that.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.760]   And I think that, look, the reason that it has taken off in popularity is because of Netflix
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.640]   and because of ways that other people could come into understanding the backstories and
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   get into it.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.360]   Because this was something that I was only tangentially.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.200]   Netflix made F1, didn't it?
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.600]   For, I think for a certain sector.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.600]   In America.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.600]   In America.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.800]   Because my husband is a huge Formula One fan and has been our whole relationship.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.400]   And I, it's so funny to me that now it's like this thing that everyone likes.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400]   The drive to survive.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.680]   Because it was this thing that I used to just sort of like one year come in, one year go
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.320]   out the other that he would talk about.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.240]   But that's how you get people interested in a sport is you talk about the human element.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.240]   Yes.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.800]   And you talk about the drama, the story.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.600]   Which is one thing that like the NFL films used to do really well.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:29.000]   And that a lot of the things that they would figure out so much freer time on the, you
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.400]   know, whatever network they had the relationships with that people would get sucked into the
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   stories.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.400]   Right.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.680]   And that's the same with college football as well.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.720]   People get into the narratives behind the players and that carries them through.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.720]   You know?
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.200]   Do you think women need that more than men?
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   No.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   I think that it's.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   Everybody.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.640]   I mean, it's the same thing with the Olympics and it's kind of a flop, right?
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   The story behind the.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.140]   The problem with the Olympics is that it's every four years.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.800]   So it's hard to have a consistent.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.800]   You can't really follow them.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800]   Right.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.260]   Whereas with teams you have this week by week thing.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.760]   But no, it's not just a women thing.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.440]   Men, I mean, look, wrestling is still incredibly popular.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440]   It's a soap opera.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440]   Yes.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440]   It's incredibly popular.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.120]   It's a soap opera and it's almost exclusively men.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.120]   Right.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.280]   Like it's just it's the exact same thing.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.840]   I know a lot of women into.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.840]   That's the perfect argument.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.840]   WWE.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.080]   Yeah, but it's mostly men.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.080]   It's mostly men.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.080]   It's mostly men.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.080]   OK.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.120]   I'm interested going back to the question of riot and League of Legends.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:33.080]   I feel the comparison to the NFL is interesting because I feel like whatever form e-sports
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.880]   takes if it becomes massively popular like that.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:39.640]   I mean, it is already massively popular, but I don't think it will be popular in the same
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.680]   format that football is.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:49.080]   I think that we have to envision a new way for these sports to be consumed.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:54.560]   And riot is really doing a good job of making a game that is completely inscrutable.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.560]   Interesting.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.760]   Yeah, I watched some of the gameplay after I watched that open.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.000]   What the hell is going on?
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.760]   This is what I'm really curious about this because, yeah, five million of viewers, you
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.120]   said, Christina, five point one million concurrent.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.240]   Concurrent.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.840]   Is that just for the opening ceremony?
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.640]   See, that's what I would want to know.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.520]   And that's a great question because I have a similar question with that, which is you
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.280]   wonder how much of the spectacle do they put into it because then watching the actual gameplay
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.280]   stuff can be…
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.480]   Well, if you know what's going on, I'm sure it's very exciting.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.800]   But if you're brought in by the other things, how do you even…
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:34.340]   If you watch a traditional sport, it can be complicated, but you can at least know sort
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:35.340]   of what's happening.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:41.080]   I've been watching the play-by-play on League of Legends for about a decade because it's
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.920]   gotten very professional, by the way.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.400]   The announcers are a hundred times better.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.360]   They are as good now as major league sports announcers.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.720]   They add excitement.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.200]   They know what they're talking about.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.680]   They sound like something exciting is happening, even though it just looks like, I don't know
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.680]   what.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.760]   And so they've improved that.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.160]   I noticed they don't cut away to the players' faces very often anymore.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.760]   They all have cameras, but they don't show the players because mostly the players are
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.760]   focused.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.240]   Nobody makes a good face when they're gaming.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240]   They're concentrated.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240]   They're all focused.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.320]   It's like chess happening really fast.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.560]   I mean, clearly these guys are amazing.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.560]   I can tell that.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.040]   And the announcers have done a good job, I think.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.600]   So I do think they're improving a lot.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.280]   I'm very interested.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.280]   The only problem is if you're a League of Legends fan, then you're not a Dota fan.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.200]   And if you're a Dota fan, then you're not an Overwatch fan.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.840]   What do we need to be?
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.840]   Because clearly there are huge audiences for these games.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.840]   There's enough slices.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.840]   They're all successful in their own way.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:54.220]   I would say Riot, what they've done really well is they have Arcane, the animated series
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.220]   that's on Netflix.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.400]   It's a League of Legends show.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.040]   That's what you do.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:02.440]   This isn't created by them, but the American Vandal creators have a series called Players,
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.720]   which is about a League of Legends team, an eSports team.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.760]   That's like a parody.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.000]   And Riot signed off on that.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.600]   It's not like a League of Legends show.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.120]   But they are finding these different venues to make it accessible.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.520]   I think that'd be very interesting.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:22.340]   I mean, because these guys, they live in houses and train together.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.160]   It's like K-pop, essentially, where they're living in a dorm.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.360]   I understand there's probably reasons they wouldn't want to televise that because I don't
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.920]   think it's a great standard of living.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.920]   There's a lot of nose picking going on.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:40.080]   Not only that, I think there's a line between the story that you want to shape with that
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.160]   narrative, and then the reality, which could be very exploitative and where you see how
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.160]   hard it is.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.160]   And this would be true for a lot of sports.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.280]   You wouldn't want to necessarily see everything that goes into that.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.000]   I think Drive to Survive as successful as it was, somebody in Denmos in our chat room
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.560]   said, "I've been a fan 30 years.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.040]   Most real F1 fans hate Drive to Survive."
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   They do.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.040]   That's true.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.440]   That's actually not what I've heard from long-term F1 fans at all.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.320]   I think if you're a fan, you should say, "This is good for the sport."
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.160]   That's exactly what my husband said, and he's been into it since he was a kid.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.660]   There's two facets to this.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:17.960]   One is that the way in which Drive to Survive is edited, there are some inaccuracies that
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:23.880]   creep through with the order they play radio messages and things like that.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:29.480]   That being said, I do completely agree with Grant, Christina, that it is the most effective
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:33.080]   onboarding tool for a sport that is very technical.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:38.960]   It does allow people to understand what it's about and then to go on and learn for themselves
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.880]   why I care about freaking tire compounds and why that's something they never talk about
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.880]   in Drive to Survive.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.080]   But once you start watching the sport after being onboarded in this very gentle way, you
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.080]   learn about these things and it becomes interesting to you.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:56.080]   They should never have made Louis drive on those hards because it really hurt his ability,
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080]   I think.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.640]   I will never learn not to put Louis on hards.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.000]   They will die on that hill.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.480]   I will die on that hill, I guess.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.000]   I don't know, even Louis was very happy about the whole thing.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.160]   I love it when he gets on the radio and says, "You got me on the wrong tires, mate."
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.400]   But then they said it in the video that the engineers do after where they're going through
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.400]   and answering questions.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.560]   They're like, "Yeah, we messed up.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.480]   We should have listened to George."
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.880]   I knew you were an F1 fan, so I've got some crib notes that I had somebody write down,
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.880]   lying on them.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.320]   I don't know about the popularity of it because my tweets don't get much engagement.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.720]   Where are you all?
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.120]   Engage with me.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.080]   I tweet about soup and 50 people are like, "Queen, yes, we're speaking truth."
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.720]   Everybody understands soup.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.720]   There's no...
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.800]   I tweet about hard tires.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.440]   It's silence out there.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.480]   I think that's probably a good lesson that Twitter just forces you to tweet about soup.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.400]   And we need to discuss that, like the soup bias on the internet.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400]   Huge bias.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.400]   Disgusting.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   Disgusting.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   Talk about stuff.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   I have to say...
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   Everybody's interested.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   Go ahead, Brianna.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.960]   No, I was just going to say your garlic soup recipe nearly killed me somehow when she put
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   out this recipe.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:18.440]   A life for garlic is just like soak 80 bulbs of garlic in olive oil and do it with 17 sticks
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.560]   of butter.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.240]   And I tried it and I was like, "I am literally...
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.720]   I am not in my 20s.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.480]   I will die if I keep trying this."
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.000]   The Smitten Kitchen 44 clove garlic soup.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.080]   Is there anything else in it?
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.920]   Is there anything else in it?
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920]   I don't remember actually.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.560]   I think like maybe potatoes and obviously like broth.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.880]   Garlic, butter, olive oil.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.120]   It's perfect.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.120]   It's so healing.
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.920]   Your entire nose will be emptied out after eating it.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.320]   Very few people could eat that, I think, and survive.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.680]   I would take a little break.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.400]   Then after the break, we're going to do something that Brianna has been preparing.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   I don't know what it is.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400]   I have no idea.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   Oh dear.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400]   Oh dear.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.560]   You've got to open up your badge.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.000]   And then, yeah, we've got an exclusive.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.840]   Because of the GitHub event coming up, I have got my GitHub badge, a hackable programmable
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.840]   badge.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.840]   Wow.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.240]   Martin, you created this for...
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.520]   This is kind of in the DEFCON style where you have a badge that is more than just a
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.160]   piece of plastic with a name.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.280]   I can't wait to find out what's in this.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.280]   That's exciting.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.400]   Thank you for bringing me this.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.440]   We'll show you this in a little bit.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.140]   But first, I want to show you something else.
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.040]   My rocket money.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.040]   You guys know Truebill.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.040]   Truebill is the greatest thing.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:37.520]   I subscribed to Truebill years ago.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.240]   Truebill finds your subscriptions, tells you what you subscribe to.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.640]   Often, it's a surprise.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.000]   Yes, often he realized, "Oh, okay.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   That's okay."
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.080]   I've been paying for that for...
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080]   How many years?
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   Okay, great.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.520]   I inadvertently checked a box that said, "Make this a recurring campaign contribution."
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   Oh no.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520]   Oh no.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.680]   Literally, thousands of dollars later.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.680]   Truebill found it.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.680]   Thank God.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.680]   They saved me so much money.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.720]   Well, Truebill is now rocket money.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.040]   I tell you, it is even better.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.400]   I am a huge fan.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.160]   Everybody watching this show, I guarantee you, is wasting money on a subscription they've
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.480]   forgotten about that automatically renews and it's just slowly drip, drip, drip, drain
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.480]   in your bank account.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:26.240]   80% of people, according to Rocket Money, have subscriptions they've just forgotten
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.560]   about.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:33.480]   An unused Amazon Prime account, a Hulu account that you forgot you even had, maybe a magazine
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.840]   or a newsletter you subscribe to.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.840]   There's a great app.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.680]   This is the greatest app for tracking my expenses, more than just, by the way, recurring expenses.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.000]   It does it all now, which is really good.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.400]   I get my net worth.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.920]   I get my recurring expenses.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:54.520]   I can hook up all my accounts to this, but it pays for itself because you're going to
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.600]   save money on subscriptions you've forgotten.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:03.080]   Most Americans think they've pulled them and think they spend about $80 a month on subscriptions.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.840]   The actual amount is closer to $200.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.400]   That's a lot of people wasting more than $100 every month on subscriptions they don't even
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.520]   know about.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.200]   You will see them and there's a button and you can cancel it.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.760]   It's so cool.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   It'll find subscriptions you didn't know you were paying for.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.840]   Maybe you're getting double charged.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.200]   It'll find those too.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.200]   Just press cancel.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:29.520]   Rocket Money takes care of the rest.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.840]   Now with Rocket Money, I not only know about all my subscriptions, I kind of have my budget
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.840]   done here.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.640]   I know what I spend.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.000]   I know what categories.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.480]   I get graphs.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.120]   I get how much I got paid.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.120]   It's all in there and it's fantastic.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.560]   I have to recommend this so highly.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.200]   It's so fantastic.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.240]   Thank you.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:57.160]   I think Rocket Mortgage people bought TrueBill and they've made it even better.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:01.680]   How many times have I found or canceled a subscription that saved me money?
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.680]   So many times.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.600]   Don't cancel your ClubTWIT subscription though.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.000]   That's not okay.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.240]   But any other subscription or your Rocket Pro, no, you keep that subscription.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.120]   That's a good, see that's the thing.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.840]   There are things you want.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.880]   So it's good to know what you're subscribing to so you can get rid of things you don't
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.040]   want like your Twitter Blue subscription.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.660]   Rocket Money, formerly known as TrueBill, you can download it right now for iOS or Android.
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:30.520]   You must have this at least to get rid of those useless subscriptions.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.680]   RocketMoney.com/twit.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:36.840]   It could save you hundreds of dollars a year, maybe more.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.520]   Me, thousands.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.240]   I don't even know.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.680]   Rocket Money, it was from 2018 that I've been paying this.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:50.920]   You know how they do this in ActBlue where you check the box and you kind of, they're
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.160]   recurring and you forget and I forgot and it was a big check.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.600]   It was right in every month.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.720]   It wasn't my intent.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.120]   Rocket Money, thank you.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.480]   RocketMoney.com/twit.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.640]   Cancel your unnecessary subscriptions right now.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:07.560]   Everybody listening, everybody watching, just get it.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.840]   RocketMoney.com/twit.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.880]   It will pay for itself.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.240]   All right.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.400]   Brianna's been planning something.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.400]   Is it a quiz?
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.920]   I'm gathering it's a quiz.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.920]   Yeah?
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.920]   It's okay.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:27.280]   So look, if you had Kelly Clarkson and Ruben Stoddard in the same building.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.280]   He was robbed by the way.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.280]   I just want to say.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.280]   Yeah, 100%.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.280]   Ruben won?
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280]   Oh, okay.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.280]   Okay.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.280]   I thought he came in second.
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:35.280]   No, Clay Aiken came in second.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.280]   Oh, Clay Aiken.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.280]   Right.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.280]   He was not robbed.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   He had some other problems.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280]   We'll talk about him later.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   Okay.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.280]   So, so we have-
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.280]   Ruben Stoddard was like, that was like season two, wasn't it?
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.280]   That was season two.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.280]   We have Leo.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:53.880]   You're one of the most prestigious, like respected, longtime journalists in the entire
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.440]   tech industry.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.480]   And we have Christina Warren here who is the T-800 of tech knowledge, a truly terrifying
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.480]   competitor for anything.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.480]   Anything.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.920]   It doesn't matter what you're doing.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.880]   You know, I figure if you have the best of the best, what does Rocket do?
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.480]   We put together an impromptu game show.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.480]   We're so scared.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.480]   We're just looking at each other going, "Uh-oh."
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.160]   So, we talk to your producers ahead of time.
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.160]   I'm going to have some of them bring this on out if they can.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:26.440]   Do I have a clicker, like a Jeopardy clicker?
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.320]   So do you want the good news or the bad news first, Leo?
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.320]   What do you think?
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.080]   I think we have to hear the bad news.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.560]   I always start with the bad news.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.560]   Okay.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:43.440]   So the bad news is the loser of this contest is going to get a pie in the face by the winner
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.320]   is going to put a pie in your face.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.360]   Your team checked it.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.720]   They made sure that you've got all the equipment there.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720]   Yes.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.760]   Oh my God.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.040]   Jason Howell is actually filling the pie now.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.040]   That's right.
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.040]   With creamy, delicious whipped cream.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.040]   The stakes are very high.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.040]   The stakes are very high.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.040]   More.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   More.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.040]   More.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.040]   There's more.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.040]   Let's get some cherries on there.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.040]   Oh, beautiful.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.040]   Is that a green cherry?
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.040]   It's a maraschino cherry.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.040]   I'm sorry?
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.040]   What was that?
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.040]   It was all I had.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.400]   Fair.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.320]   This was 100% my idea.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.320]   Don't blame your staff.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.320]   This was on me.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:28.560]   The good news is the winner of this is going to get a lovely original artwork by Frank
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.560]   Wu.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.560]   I want to win.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.840]   I'm congratulating them on the very first...
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.320]   Can we bring that out?
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   It is a certificate.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:41.640]   It's been printed on your office printer with awesome Frank Wu artwork.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.280]   This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.280]   There we go.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.280]   It's so beautiful.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.280]   That's so wonderful.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:47.760]   The Rocket X Twitch Showdown.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.200]   Oh my gosh.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:54.040]   Frank told me every one of these creatures he drew on here represents one of us.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:59.720]   The singing dinosaur is of course Simone and Christina is the deadly tank at the bottom
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.440]   because she is deadly too.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.040]   The shoulder shot is over here now.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.040]   There we go.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:11.160]   Leo, you're the double guitar and I am the centipede because I work in politics.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.960]   That is awesome.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.560]   You work in politics so you have many legs.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.560]   That's right.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560]   That is awesome.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.680]   A creature with lasers running across...
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.440]   The Rocket X Twitch Showdown 2022.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.780]   Thank you, Frank Wu, for designing that.
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.440]   This is how it's going to work.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.240]   We're going to have some questions and I'll explain the further rules later.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.320]   I'm so scared right now.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.080]   I am so scared right now.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.480]   Should be.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:45.200]   We're going to ask a question and we're going to go turn.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.560]   Leo call heads or tails.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.320]   So it doesn't have to be a speed thing.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.320]   Okay.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.320]   That's correct.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.320]   You want heads?
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.320]   Flip the coin.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.320]   Christina, you're going first.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.320]   Okay.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.320]   Oh, you have flipped the coin before I said it?
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320]   I did.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.680]   I wrote it right here on my piece of paper.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.680]   That's efficiency, baby.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680]   Okay.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.680]   Go ahead, Christina.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.680]   All right.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:03.680]   Christina.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.680]   Yes.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.680]   In 1994, iOmega came out with their massively popular Zip Drive.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.680]   Yes.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.400]   The original version of that technology came out eventually in three capacities.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.400]   Yes.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.880]   What were those three capacities?
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:23.440]   100 megabytes, 250 megabytes, 700 megabytes.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.440]   That is correct.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.440]   Wow.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.440]   Wow.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   I wasn't sure about the 700.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.440]   I remember that because that was when they were trying to get CRs.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.480]   Wait, did you say 700 or 750?
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.480]   She said 100.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.480]   700.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.480]   Was it 750 megabytes?
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.480]   No.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.480]   750.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.520]   We're going to have to give you partial credit for that.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.520]   She got two out of three.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.520]   Okay.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520]   All right.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.280]   I almost said 750, but it was 750.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.280]   Okay.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.280]   Okay.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.280]   I would have got that wrong.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.680]   I will very generously award you seven points for that.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.680]   Okay.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.960]   That's a random number apparently.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.520]   Are all the awards prime numbers?
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.520]   Let me ask you that.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520]   Okay.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.520]   Go ahead, please.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520]   Continue.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520]   Okay.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.520]   Leo.
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.520]   I'm so scared.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.160]   What is the alternative name for the Haze Command Set originally developed for 300
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.480]   bod modems?
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480]   Is it the ATD?
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.600]   Let me think.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.080]   Is it just the AT Command Set?
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.440]   I'm going to say it's not ATDT, which is what you type.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.080]   I think it's the AT Command Set.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.200]   Is that your final answer?
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.840]   Oh shoot.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:23.840]   Christina says yes.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840]   I think this is right.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.680]   I think this is right.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.440]   I think it's the AT Command Set.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440]   That is correct.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.440]   Ten points for Leo.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.440]   But it is ATDT you spell out, but okay.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.440]   Okay.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.440]   Good.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.440]   So here's our first-
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.440]   How many points do I get for that?
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.440]   Ten?
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.440]   You get ten points.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.440]   Okay.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.840]   So Christina, Leo scored a point free and fair.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.560]   So now we come to the complicating factor of this game.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.040]   The Simone chaos question.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.600]   So Simone, she's unpredictable.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.600]   Is there garlic soup involved?
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.600]   You don't know.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.600]   Because that would be chaos.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.920]   With Simone, it could literally be anything.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.160]   It could be anything.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.160]   Okay.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.160]   Okay.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.240]   So, you know, I've seen these questions.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:16.040]   I personally wouldn't ask any of them, but you can opt for the option and ask Simone
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.520]   for a chaos question and ten points are on the line.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.600]   So you either get ten points or you will lose ten points based on-
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.400]   What if we don't ask for a chaos question?
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.280]   Then it just goes on.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.360]   Okay.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.920]   So like at any point we can beg for a chaos question?
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.920]   Is that out?
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:33.920]   Yes.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.920]   Like a lifeline?
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.920]   That's correct.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.200]   So like, will you ask a question and then say, "Well, I don't want to answer that.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.200]   Give me the chaos question."
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:39.200]   Is that correct?
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.040]   I'll answer after someone else scores.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.040]   Okay.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.040]   Okay.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040]   So you could ask now-
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.040]   So I can now ask for a chaos question.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.040]   For a chaos question.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.040]   Yes.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.040]   Or I can ask for a regular question.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:49.040]   Yes.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040]   All right.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.040]   How many points am I at now?
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.040]   Am I at eight points now?
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.040]   Seven.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040]   You're at seven points.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.040]   I'm at seven points to ten.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.040]   All right.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.040]   Let's go for a chaos question.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.040]   All right.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:08.400]   Brianna, should I ask these in order or can I move around?
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.920]   I would ask them in order so it's-
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.920]   I'm worried about favoritism.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:11.920]   Okay.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.920]   Sure.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.920]   It's up to you.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:14.920]   All right.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:15.920]   Let me say about that.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.080]   I've done a show with Christina for a long time.
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:22.080]   I asked, I put together questions that we have not talked about on the show and took
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.080]   that very seriously.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.080]   Okay.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:25.080]   You have unlocked chaos mode.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.080]   Go ahead.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.080]   Okay.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:32.920]   Christina, now my questions are rewarding, not simply hard knowledge, but also creativity.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.920]   Yes.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:44.600]   I would like you to tell me what is the most French color and why?
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.600]   Le cordon bleu.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.600]   Oh, that's good.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.600]   That's good.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.600]   I like it.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:54.600]   Because that was the first one I could think of and that's my answer.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.600]   Cordon bleu.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:56.600]   That's your reason why.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:57.600]   Yes.
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.600]   Oh, God.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.120]   So is there judgment involved in the answer?
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120]   I don't know.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.760]   To Simone, you have to decide.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.520]   You can't predict how she's going to go.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.720]   I am the expert of the Simone chaos question.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:11.720]   What is the most French color?
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.720]   I have to say.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.720]   I've never taken a chaos.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.720]   Le cordon bleu.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:15.720]   You're correct.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.720]   She's right.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:17.720]   I think she's right.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:18.720]   You got it.
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.720]   Is that 20 points?
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.720]   I'm looking at Wikipedia right here.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:21.720]   I just now have 10 extra points.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.720]   10 extra points.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.720]   10 extra points.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.720]   That's right.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:25.720]   Now it's Christina's turn.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:26.720]   Okay.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:27.720]   All right.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.720]   Christina.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.720]   Wow.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.160]   You've got a question on three shows.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:38.560]   Attack of the Show, X-Play and G4 Underground.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:43.160]   So glad you didn't ask me that question.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.120]   Attack of the Show, X-Play, G4 Underground.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.120]   Was that Kevin?
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.680]   What's his last name?
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.680]   Your final answer?
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.680]   Ken Ferrer.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:53.960]   I just wanted to say that's your final answer?
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.440]   Yeah, that's my final answer.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.440]   Nope.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.440]   Morgan Webb.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.440]   Morgan Webb.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.440]   That was actually my first thought was getting Morgan.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.440]   Wrong on that one.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.440]   Cool.
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.440]   Wrong.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.440]   Okay.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.440]   I'm glad you didn't ask me that question.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.440]   I'm glad that I at least got-
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.440]   Morgan would have been mad at me for getting it wrong.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.000]   She would have mad at you because you know her.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.920]   I was just a, somebody watched these things.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:14.800]   So I'm just glad I took the chaos question.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.800]   So okay.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.240]   So now she's got 27 points.
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.240]   No, I've got 17 points.
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.240]   17 points.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.240]   You're a 10.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.600]   Why didn't she get another 10 for getting the Morgan-
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   Because I got it wrong.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   Oh, you got it wrong.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600]   That's right.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600]   Okay.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600]   Okay, Leah.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.320]   I'm not going to take a- My instinct was actually to say Morgan Webb first.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.760]   And then when I was thinking of it, I was like, "Was she on Attack the Show?"
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.760]   And I couldn't remember.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.760]   There we go.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.800]   Leo, you can take a chaos question or you can-
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.040]   So if I do a chaos question, I get that and I get a question.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.040]   Yes.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.040]   Correct.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.040]   But there are only five chaos questions.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040]   Just so you know.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.120]   And it's a chance to, basically it's a bonus.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.120]   Yes.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.800]   You have a chance to either get another 10 points or lose 10 points.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.800]   I just want to throw up.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:55.800]   All right.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.520]   I'll do a chaos question.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.520]   Okay.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.520]   Oh boy.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.520]   Oh, Leo.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.880]   I'm so sorry.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.860]   It's not the French one.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:10.180]   Can you explain to me, to my satisfaction, the plot of SS Rajamouli's 2022 masterpiece
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:16.760]   film RRR?
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:25.680]   So you're in a spaceship on the way to Mars.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.680]   Okay.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:34.200]   Unfortunately, what you don't know is that in between you and Mars is a black hole that
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.960]   no one's seen because it's a black hole.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:37.960]   Sure.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:45.480]   You get sucked into it and you emerge into the Teletubbies kingdom.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:51.680]   Now, the comedy that ensues subsequently is really the main point of RRR, but I don't
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.680]   want to spoil this for anybody.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:01.200]   Judge Simone, you're tough but fair.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:02.720]   What's the verdict?
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:10.400]   I'm so torn because it feels disrespectful to the great director to give this any points,
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.520]   but also you really did put in...
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.520]   Wait, no.
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:14.520]   Okay.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.520]   I will give you this.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.840]   If you can explain to me why this film that you have just described so perfectly is called
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.840]   RRR.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.760]   Well, it's a fictitious story about two heroes who are away from home in the Teletubbies
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.760]   land.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.200]   What does that have to do with the letter R?
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:33.800]   Leo, I'm giving you such a big option.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.800]   I am holding out my hand.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.800]   RRR.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.240]   I never heard of RRR.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:41.040]   Is this some Bollywood epic feature?
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040]   Yes.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.040]   It's a masterpiece.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.040]   It is a Tollywood feature.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.040]   Tolly, not Bolly.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.040]   Thank you.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:55.480]   It's really right reliable.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.480]   And that's okay.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.000]   The Teletubby movie is called Really Right Reliable.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   Leo.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000]   Leo.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   No.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000]   You just talked yourself out of 10 points.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   I don't...
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]   Talk yourself out of it.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.480]   I had no reason to get any points for that at all.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.480]   I have no idea what's going on.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.480]   All right.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.480]   Unfortunately, Leo, you're not...
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:16.480]   It's about pirates on their way to Mars and they go RRR.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:21.080]   RRR when they find out they're in Teletubby land.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.080]   He gets half points.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.440]   I saved myself with the Teletubbies joke.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440]   Okay.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.440]   I love a fun.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.760]   Leo, you're at five points.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.760]   She does love a fun.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:31.760]   Oh, so I didn't know this.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:32.760]   This question is easy.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:33.760]   This isn't an easy one.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.400]   You'll be very happy.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:41.160]   Two companies developed the CD-ROM format in 1984.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.240]   What were those two companies?
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:47.400]   Sony was one.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.960]   The other company, CD-ROMs, Phillips.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.160]   Is that your final answer?
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.160]   Yes.
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.400]   You are correct.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.400]   That means you were at 15 points.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.400]   It was joint effort.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.400]   Congratulations.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400]   Joint effort, Sony and Phillips.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.400]   Nice.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.400]   Nice.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.760]   I saw the chat room did say it, but don't say this chat room.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:04.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.960]   But I didn't see it before they said it, but don't say any answers because that spoils it.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:10.960]   All right.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.960]   So, Christina...
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.840]   Elon Musk has now suspended Kathy Griffin.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840]   Yes.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.840]   Oh, I saw that.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:16.840]   We saw that.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.840]   Okay.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.360]   Christina, you can take the option for a chaos question.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.360]   There are only five of them.
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360]   Okay.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:26.080]   And I got to tell you, the next one's pretty hard, but it's up to you.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.080]   Okay.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:28.640]   I'll take the chaos question because I'm behind.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   Okay.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.640]   No, you're not.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.440]   You have 17 and Leo has 15.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:34.440]   You're leading.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.440]   You're winning.
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.440]   Oh, I'm leading.
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.440]   Yes.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:38.440]   Okay.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.440]   Then I'll take the...
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.440]   I will take the regular question.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.440]   You just want a normal question?
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.440]   Okay.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.440]   Also, very easy.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.440]   I can't tell you.
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.440]   But that's what put you ahead was your...
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.440]   Yeah, I know it was.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.440]   I know it was.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.440]   But if I'm ahead, then...
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.440]   Why take the chance?
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:51.440]   Yeah, why risk myself a gamble?
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:52.440]   On my whimsy.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:53.440]   Yeah, okay.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.440]   I understand.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:00.280]   I wouldn't mess with someone.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:04.200]   The original Apple iPod shipped in two sizes.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.200]   What were they?
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.200]   The original Apple iPod?
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.200]   Okay.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:12.680]   It was five gigabytes and 10 gigabytes.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:13.680]   That's correct.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.680]   It was not gigabytes.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.680]   Well done.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:16.680]   I need to tell you.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.680]   Yeah, it was.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:18.680]   The iPod.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.680]   Was it gigs?
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:20.680]   Yes.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:21.680]   Okay.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:22.680]   It was a thousand pounds in your pocket.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.680]   Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:24.680]   It had to be a gig.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:26.680]   Couldn't be a megabyte.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.680]   No, it was gigabytes.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:29.680]   Okay.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:30.680]   I would have said megabytes, but you're right.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:31.680]   It's gigs obviously.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:33.680]   Yeah, because the second one was 10 and 20 and then it was...
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.680]   Then they had a 30.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680]   I didn't realize.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.480]   So right off the box, they did five and 10.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:41.680]   I think that it was just five and first and then there was still a 10 gig in the first
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:42.680]   generation.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:47.680]   Then when the second generation came out that summer, it was 10 and 20.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.680]   All right, Leo, are you taking the chaos question or are you just putting me down?
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.680]   Yeah, why not?
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.680]   What the hell?
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.680]   I got to catch up here.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:58.680]   Yep.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.680]   R, R, R.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.680]   You might actually...
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:04.600]   This might be tailored to your interests demographically, Leo.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:12.260]   What is the appropriate way to introduce Ernest Hemingway?
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.260]   How would you do it?
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:16.260]   How would you introduce Ernest Hemingway to someone?
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:21.520]   I don't know where she's going with this.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.520]   I don't either.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:27.960]   I would just say, "Here's Ernie."
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:34.000]   I can't believe you specifically chose a nickname that Ernest Miller Hemingway, born
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.840]   in Oak Park, Illinois in 1899, hated.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.840]   Okay.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.080]   I'm suggesting come to Papa.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.080]   Would that work?
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.080]   Chat gets 10 points.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.080]   Chat gets 10 points.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.080]   I like it.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.080]   Chat gets 10 points.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.600]   That night, we are vibing and I bet Chat has watched R, R, R too.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.160]   Leo, I can't believe this.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.160]   Come on.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:00.160]   I take it I don't get any points for this.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.160]   No.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:02.160]   Ernie, no.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.160]   Okay, Simone, how should one introduce Ernest Hemingway?
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.720]   Ernest Miller Hemingway, born in Oak Park, Illinois in 1899.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.200]   That's how you should introduce him.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.000]   But, if you had come up with a better answer, I would okay.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   Come to Papa is pretty good.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   Much like as Chat, come to Papa.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]   Come to Papa is pretty good.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000]   I would say I would wave you over.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   I see you across the room.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.480]   Simone, are we doing minus 10 points on this?
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.480]   Oh, I lose points?
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.480]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.480]   Yes.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.480]   This way is the chaos question.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.480]   I'm going to zero now.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:29.480]   But you might get the tech question.
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:30.480]   You're 15.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.480]   You shouldn't have toyed with me, Leo.
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:32.480]   Okay.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.480]   So, the tech question.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:40.480]   Which version of OS X was the first to support 64-bit architecture on the OS X?
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.240]   Architecture on PowerPC.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.240]   Oh my God.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:45.960]   Come on, you know this.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.960]   I do?
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:55.240]   On PowerPC, 64-bit.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:01.320]   It must have been a big cat or a cat of some kind.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:04.400]   I'm going to say Leopard.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:07.600]   Is that your final answer?
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.600]   Yes.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.800]   That is not correct, unfortunately.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:11.800]   It was Jaguar.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.800]   Yeah, that was 10.3, right?
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:14.800]   Yep.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:15.800]   10.2, actually.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.800]   Oh, it was 10.2.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.800]   I would have gotten it wrong then.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.800]   So, okay.
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   There we go.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.800]   Okay.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.520]   All right, Christina, two chaos questions left.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.520]   Are you going to take one or are you going to enjoy your lead?
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:32.040]   Yeah, I'm going to take a chaos question because it's chaos and we have to.
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.040]   It's chaotic.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.800]   I think she's put all this effort into these ridiculous questions.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   I agree.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.000]   I feel like I have a buffer now, so even if I lose, I have a shot.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000]   You have a buffer.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   You do.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000]   Pretty much it's guaranteed I'm going to get a pie in the face.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.480]   Or one of us is going to get a pie in the face.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.400]   Can we do it at the end of the show instead of in the middle of the show?
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.400]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:50.400]   Thank you.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.400]   We still have a few hours to go.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.400]   Absolutely.
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.400]   Okay.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.400]   The chaos questions are artistic.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.400]   They are creative.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:02.880]   If you don't know an answer, you have the ability to invent one to my satisfaction.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.880]   I tried.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:04.880]   And in light of that.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:05.880]   Yes.
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:06.880]   I tried.
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:17.480]   Christina, which F1 driver most deserves the moniker of my evil wife and why?
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:28.840]   Well, Lewis Hamilton, because you love him, but he also confounds you and his team definitely
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.040]   confounds you.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.680]   Oh, but is he the evil or is it Mercedes?
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:39.480]   Well, Mercedes is the evil one, but you also want him to be your wife.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:44.880]   So, Christina, I can't give this to you.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:45.880]   Okay.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:46.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.960]   I love Lewis Hamilton too much to ever call him my evil wife.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.960]   Okay.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:52.960]   Let me think who our evil wife would be.
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:55.720]   So, minus 10 points or partial credits?
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.320]   I do want to hear Leo's opinion on this.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:01.800]   This would actually probably have been the one that Leo would have totally given great
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.800]   at.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.800]   Evil wife.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.080]   I do have one in mind.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:11.840]   I'm willing to put him aside for the purposes of your creativity, but there is someone who
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:12.840]   very-
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.000]   You have someone in mind that's like an obvious evil wife.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.360]   Oh yes.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.960]   I think, well, I'm torn between Daniel Ricciardo and Sebastian Vettel.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:30.480]   I can't decide who should be my evil wife.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:39.360]   I'm going to say Sebastian Vettel because he's sad and lonely now that he's not racing anymore.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.960]   Oh, that's good.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.080]   I disagree.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.800]   I think Red Bull era Seb would have been an evil wife, but now he's just like a beekeeper
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:55.080]   dad and he only wants good in the world.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:00.720]   Daniel Ricciardo, aside from what he did to Yuki Tsunoda last week, hasn't been doing
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.720]   any crimes.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.720]   That was pretty evil.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:03.720]   Fernando Alonso.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.080]   Fernando Alonso is your evil wife.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.160]   Because why?
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.920]   Of all of the history of crimes that he has committed on track and off.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.440]   He only cares about chaos.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:20.040]   I'm thinking George Russell is an up and comer though as an evil wife.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.240]   Oh yeah, future evil wife right there.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.840]   Okay, judgment.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:24.840]   Sorry.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.840]   I will give Leo half points.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.840]   No, I get no points.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:27.840]   I was just throwing it in.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.840]   Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:35.840]   I almost said Amber Heard, but I gather that she's not in the F1.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.840]   No.
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.840]   No.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:38.840]   Irrelevant.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.240]   All right, Simone, what's the judgment on Christina's points?
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.240]   Christina didn't get it.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.240]   No, I did not.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:47.720]   Lewis Hamilton is an evil wife.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.120]   All right, Christina, so you're at 17 points now.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.160]   This is your chance to come on back.
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.160]   Speaking of the jaguar.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160]   Come on back.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.160]   She's beaten me.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.160]   What is the score?
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.160]   I'm sorry?
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.160]   Chat room, what's the score?
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:04.240]   Yeah, because Leo didn't get the last question and he'd already lost 10 points.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:05.240]   I don't even think I'm close.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.240]   So he's at five I think.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.240]   I think I'm almost negative.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:12.240]   10 plus five plus 10 minus 10 plus zero.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:13.240]   Okay.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.240]   What?
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:15.240]   15.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.240]   I was told there would be no math.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.240]   Five points.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.240]   Five points.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.240]   Okay.
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:24.080]   So you've like 10 points ahead of me.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.080]   You can't lose.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.040]   Well, no, I mean I could definitely.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.040]   All right.
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:34.400]   Christina, speaking of the jaguar, universally panned title was the pack-in game for the
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.600]   Atari Jaguar in 1993.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.600]   Oh my God.
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.600]   Oh my God.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:41.640]   Okay, no, but it looked like it was.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.440]   Okay, it was, it was, no, it wasn't Asteroids.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.480]   It was one of those types of Asteroids games.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.720]   I don't know this.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.000]   It was awful, but I don't know this.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.520]   I don't know this.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.080]   You're representing Team Rocket.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:56.080]   Come on.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.080]   Come on, Christina.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.080]   Oh my God.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.080]   Oh my God.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.080]   What was it called?
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:07.200]   It was, it is the tip of my tongue.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:10.400]   I don't know it.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.480]   For partial credit, I will tell you the first letter.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:16.160]   Okay.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.440]   Crystal Quest.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:28.800]   No, it was, it was a shoot 'em up style kind of arcade game, right?
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.280]   Like it was similar to.
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.280]   No?
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:33.280]   Yeah, okay.
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.280]   It was, okay.
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:35.280]   It was, it was.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:39.200]   Come on, it was the 90s.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:44.280]   Think about what, what was everything in the, in the, in the 90s that started with the
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.280]   sea.
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.280]   Crystal Quest.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:47.280]   This is what I'm hearing.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.080]   I'm cheating here.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080]   Crystal Quest.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.080]   No.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.080]   No.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.080]   That is zero points for you.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.080]   Okay.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.080]   What was the answer?
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.080]   It is cyber morph.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.080]   Oh my God.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.080]   Yes.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:00.080]   Okay.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.080]   Okay.
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.080]   Okay.
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.080]   I would never have cyber.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.080]   I never would have gotten that.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.080]   Okay.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.080]   All right.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.080]   All right.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.080]   I guess we've got to wait for Leo to come back.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.080]   Yep.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.080]   We'll see if Leo is going to return or not.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:12.080]   Are you guys having a good time?
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:13.080]   We're having a great time.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:16.080]   We're going to be in the country so it doesn't get pie in the face.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:21.120]   So this week in Tech Listeners, if you want more chaos like this, tune in to Rocket every
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.240]   week, Real AFM.
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.240]   Become a boostie.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:31.400]   You'll have even more opportunities to hear like the twisted things from Simone's imagination,
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.240]   but also Bree's great question games.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.440]   I got mine wrong by the way, Leo.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.440]   Did you?
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.440]   I did.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.840]   I never was going to get cyber or something.
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.800]   So you will, but I, but I appreciate that.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.800]   Are you a beekeeper now?
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.560]   This feels like cheating.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.720]   I think it's just defensive.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:47.720]   All right.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   All right.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:52.760]   Leo, would you like a chaos question or how many?
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.760]   Simone, you only have one left, right?
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:54.760]   I got one more left.
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:58.600]   Let's do the chaos question even though I have no hope in the world.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.600]   Okay.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.960]   Leo, no, I believe in you.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:06.640]   I think you can get this one and you'd be doing me a huge favor if you did.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.640]   Okay.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.240]   Because if you did, then I get pie in the face.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.180]   This is great for either way.
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.180]   This is fantastic.
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:14.840]   Oh, I know who's getting the pie in the face and it ain't you.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.320]   Go ahead.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:25.200]   Can you invent a plausible excuse for me to have not played a link to the past so that
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:29.760]   next time Brianna and Christina give me crap about it, I can give them a-
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.400]   You need to play this game, Simone.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:32.400]   Well, do I?
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.600]   Leo, can you invent a plausible excuse for why I haven't done it yet?
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.600]   Yeah, you can't play it.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   You can't play it.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.600]   You have sausage fingers.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:39.600]   Oh my God.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.600]   It's not-
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.600]   That's true.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.600]   It's not even possible.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.600]   Look at them.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.600]   Yeah, look at those.
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.600]   No, this is well known.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:51.480]   I don't even know why there's a question, frankly.
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:53.480]   You're so right and I can't believe-
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.480]   Yes.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.600]   Well, see the thing is, because we don't do a video show, Brianna and Christina don't
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600]   know about my sausage fingers.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600]   They never knew about your sausage fingers.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.600]   That's true.
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600]   We never knew.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.160]   It was a side effect from Qzempic.
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:06.980]   They say it in the commercial every single time.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:08.760]   You should just know that.
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.760]   10 points.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.760]   Thank you.
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:15.760]   I think I should get 15.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:16.760]   Alright.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.760]   Saving my life.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:18.760]   Alright.
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:19.760]   Leo, in 1997-
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:25.760]   She calls him Jimmy Dean, pure fork sausage fingers.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.280]   Sorry, in what year?
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.280]   In what year, '94?
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:31.280]   1997.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:35.520]   The consortium was developed to standardize 3D graphics for the web.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.760]   What was the name of that consortium?
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.280]   3D graphics for the web.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.280]   That's the key.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.280]   In '97?
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.280]   I have no idea.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.760]   I'm pretending.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:47.760]   I'm vamping.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:48.760]   Sorry, in what-
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.760]   3D graphics for the web.
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.760]   I didn't hear the- what company?
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.120]   No, she just said 1997.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.120]   What was the name of the 3D consortium?
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.120]   Oh, 3D consortium.
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:00.120]   3D graphics-
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.520]   For graphics on the web.
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.760]   When you say it, it's going to light my eyes up.
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.760]   No?
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.760]   You're shaking that answer.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.760]   I'm trying to think.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.760]   3D consortium.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:14.760]   If you get this, Leo, I got to say you're in a good position to win this.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:20.120]   3D for the web.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.760]   I'm going to say the 3DZ Alliance.
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.760]   Is that your final answer?
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:29.960]   Yes, I don't- I have no idea.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:30.960]   Was it OpenGL?
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.080]   No, can't have been OpenGL.
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:33.080]   I was thinking-
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:34.080]   The OpenGL?
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.080]   That's kind of what I was thinking to be honest.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:36.080]   But it's not for the web.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:38.320]   The web is the weird part.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.320]   That is the weird thing.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:40.320]   No, I have no idea.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.320]   Web3D?
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:42.320]   Web3D, I should have known that.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.320]   Web3D.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.600]   The name's in the- it's in there.
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.680]   It's baked into the question.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.520]   I was going to say, yeah, Padre had this right in the chat, so good job to all the chat members
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:57.840]   because WebGL was actually my first thought, but '97 is too early.
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:58.840]   WebGL.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:47:59.840]   Web3D.
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:00.840]   Web3D.
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.840]   It didn't survive, did it?
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.400]   No, I don't think so.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.520]   All right, that was the final question.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.120]   So now we just have to tally everything up.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:14.520]   So Christina, your score-
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.720]   I tell you what, let me do a break.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:17.720]   You do that while I do all the math.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:22.760]   Because we've pretty much lost the audience at this point, so I should do what I can to
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.760]   get them back.
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.120]   The pie in the face will make them come back.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:29.280]   The pie in the face at the end, because I don't want to muss my hair.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.120]   100% or I don't want to mess mine.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.000]   I mean, you know, like, I don't want to get stuff all over.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000]   You know pretty well.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000]   I don't know.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.600]   I don't actually know.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.000]   But before we do that, let me tell you about ITProTV.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.800]   And I hope you know how much we love ITProTV.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:52.080]   Don Pezet and Tim Broom founded ITProTV back in 2013 after going to an event at NAB that
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:57.800]   I was on a panel with Adam Kroll and others talking about kind of the future of video
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.800]   podcasting.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:03.160]   And Tim and Don were already trainers in a classroom, IT trainers.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:08.000]   And they said, wow, this would be a really cool way to do IT training.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.360]   Not tied to a school, not tied to your location.
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:12.260]   You could watch it from anywhere.
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:13.880]   It could be always up to date.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.080]   ITProTV was born.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.400]   That was nine years ago.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.520]   They've grown like crazy ever since.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:23.160]   Now they have that beautiful facility in Gainesville, Florida.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:29.480]   Seven studios operating all day Monday through Friday, creating new content because IT is
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:30.480]   always changing.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:35.400]   But with ITProTV, you're getting the best, latest training for people working in the
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.320]   field who are real experts who share their passion.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:44.100]   If you've got a business, you've got an IT team, this is a great thing you can give them
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:49.240]   to keep their skills and knowledge up to date to give them new skills to help your business
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:51.340]   on its way to success.
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:52.340]   They will love it.
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:56.360]   It is a benefit they will totally value and they will do it.
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.320]   And that's the other thing I know probably there's some concern.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.760]   Well, I'm going to get this for them, but are they going to do it?
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.760]   Well, yes.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:08.080]   80%, more than 80% of the people on ITProTV who start a video actually finish it.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:09.080]   They're engaging.
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:10.640]   They're fun.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.400]   People love them.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:15.460]   And your team is going to really value this.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.640]   You can monitor too.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:22.600]   They have a great dashboard which lets you assign seats and team members access monthly
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:23.800]   usage reports.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:28.640]   You get beautiful visual reports with information like logins, viewing time, tracks completed.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.400]   You could justify it to the higher ups with these reports.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.440]   You'll get immediate insight into your team's viewing patterns.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.360]   And they've got training for everything.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:44.400]   5,800 hours of training in Linux and Cisco and Microsoft and Apple and security and cloud,
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.400]   everything.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:50.080]   Not just technical skills, compliance skills, soft skills like marketing, all the training,
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:55.000]   all the certs for your team in one place for one great price.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.080]   This is something that your team will appreciate and you'll get the benefit of.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.080]   ITProTV.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.100]   They've got individual plans too if you're looking to get into IT.
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:07.780]   But I really want to talk to the business people out there who have that IT team.
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:11.800]   This is something that will keep them happy, keep them learning, make them more valuable
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:12.800]   to you.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.800]   And that's a win all around.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:16.800]   ITPro.TV/twit.
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.480]   Give your team the IT development platform.
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:23.320]   They not only need but they want to level up their skills while enjoying the journey.
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:30.960]   For teams of two to one thousand, go to ITPro.TV/twit today.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:34.920]   We thank them so much for their support and encourage you please to use that address because
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:40.200]   that way they know they had some impact on you from this show.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.200]   And that helps us a lot.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.920]   ITPro.TV/twit.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.360]   Another way you can help us a lot, ClubTwit.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.840]   I know Rocket, you guys were just talking about Rocket Pro.
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.520]   A great way to be a participant at Rocket.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.080]   We have something similar.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:58.120]   I think it was somewhat inspired by what you were doing and Mike's doing at Relay FM and
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:00.320]   other people.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:05.940]   Especially these days, independent podcasts are under a lot of pressure from companies
[01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:15.080]   like Spotify, Amazon, Apple who are creating podcast tiers where you use their apps to listen
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:16.880]   to podcasts.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.980]   Advertisers love that.
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:18.980]   They love it.
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:23.560]   That's why they charge so much for Joe Rogan, for instance, because it's a Spotify exclusive.
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:26.800]   That means they know exactly what you listen to, when you listen to it, how much you listen
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:27.800]   to it.
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:28.800]   They know who you are.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:30.680]   They know what your credit card number is.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:32.640]   Advertisers just love this.
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:38.920]   And it makes it hard for us at any independent podcast that's RSS based to woo advertisers.
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:41.600]   We're seeing a real decline in advertising.
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:44.440]   We're very worried frankly about next year.
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:47.000]   We're also getting pressure from Amazon which just announced that they're going to offer
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.660]   free podcasts, ad free podcasts to all Amazon Prime members.
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:53.360]   So we're getting squeezed on both ads.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:56.980]   Here's a way you can keep Twit going well into the future.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:57.980]   Just join Club Twit.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:59.520]   It's seven bucks a month.
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.120]   You'll get ad free versions of all the shows.
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:04.380]   We don't need to sell ads to you because you're already giving us the seven bucks a month
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:05.460]   we'd make.
[01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:07.360]   So that's a benefit for both of us.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.360]   It means we don't track you.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.840]   You also get the Twit Plus feed with a lot of content that doesn't show up in the shows.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:17.800]   There was a great conversation before this show that we'll put in the Twit Plus feed.
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:19.120]   Plus podcasts we don't put out.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:24.320]   Micah Sargent does Hands on Mac, which is club only, members only.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:27.200]   We have Hands on Windows with Paul Thurrock, club only.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:31.620]   The Untitled Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett, the GizFizz with Dictee Bartolo, Stacey's Book
[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:34.000]   Club which we just did on Thursday.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.660]   All of that is for the club.
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.800]   And the reason is we can't sell ads to it.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.680]   So we let the club support it.
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.680]   You as a club member, you're supporting it.
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:44.980]   You're making it possible.
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:48.840]   Many of those shows we hope will eventually become big enough that we can put them out
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:49.840]   in public.
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.040]   That's what happened to This Week in Space.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.120]   We were able to generate advertising revenue over time.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.160]   So you're supporting us in the development of new shows.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.160]   You get ad free versions.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:58.800]   You get special shows.
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:03.920]   And I didn't even mention, to me, the number one benefit is access to the Club Twit Discord,
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:06.440]   which is the most fun.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.940]   Maybe you heard me before the show.
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:10.960]   People come on our shows, all of our hosts but also all of our visitors.
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:15.280]   Oh, there I am getting a pie in the face.
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.760]   All of our hosts and all of our visitors have membership in the club.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:21.640]   And it's a great way to talk to people, not just about the shows and the content of the
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:26.140]   shows, but everything geeks like to talk about because we have a huge number of sections
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:31.840]   on everything from anime to autos to Linux to science to sports.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:34.240]   I bet you there's a little F1 conversation going on.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.640]   We've got TikTok Corner.
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:39.720]   Thanks Brianna.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:43.640]   All of that in the Club Twit Discord and you have exclusive access to it as a club member.
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.320]   I think it's worth seven bucks a month.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:47.160]   A couple of cups of coffee.
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.320]   We sure appreciate it if you're already a member.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:50.320]   Thank you.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.480]   And for those of you who aren't, just go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:56.360]   Be a great holiday gift for the geek in your life.
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:01.560]   I just want to say there's also yearly plans and there's even corporate memberships if
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.800]   your business would like to do that for your employees.
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:07.800]   Twit.tv/clubtwit, thank you in advance.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:12.520]   All right, Brianna has done the calculation.
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:13.520]   I've done the math.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:14.520]   I've run all the numbers.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.520]   Hold my hand.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:16.520]   Hold my hand.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:19.960]   Before I answer this, I just wanted to ask both of you.
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:20.960]   I promise not to hurt you.
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:23.960]   Do you think Simone should play Link to the Past?
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.140]   I just wanted to get an idea.
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:26.140]   What is Link to the Past?
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:28.440]   It's the greatest Super Nintendo game ever.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:30.480]   Oh my God!
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:33.480]   I think you can't do that with a sausage finger condition.
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:34.480]   I mean...
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:35.760]   I think you just...
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.160]   They don't make the controllers that you can get the fingers.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:42.400]   Look, I'm going to give Simone...
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:46.040]   I'm going to let her have the authority to give that answer, even if it means I get a
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.680]   pie to the face because we have to respect her authority on this.
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:50.440]   She plays Animal Crossing, right?
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:54.840]   She does, but she needs to play Link to the Past and she's refused and you did give her
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:55.840]   an excuse.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:56.840]   I haven't refused.
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:57.840]   I've procrastinated.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:58.840]   There's a difference.
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:00.920]   I think you should be really understanding about her condition.
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:02.920]   That's what I'm just saying.
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:03.920]   There we go.
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:04.920]   This is Zelda?
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:06.920]   Oh, is it about Link?
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:09.360]   Well, yes, but I mean, as all of them are...
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.040]   It's probably the best Zelda game.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.040]   The best Zelda game?
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.040]   This is amazing.
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:15.040]   Simone, have you played other Zelda games?
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.040]   She's played all the other Zelda games.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.040]   Yes!
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.040]   Well, how come you haven't played a Link to the Past?
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:21.080]   Simone DeRosche for raked over the coals for not having played a Link to the Past, which
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:22.080]   is one of the best games of all time.
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:23.080]   Which is way on the court.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:25.520]   She doesn't even know what it is!
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.000]   I had The Break of the Wind.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000]   Is that the...
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000]   Breath of the Wild.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000]   Breath of the Wild.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000]   Breath of the Wind!
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000]   Breath of the Wild!
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000]   I played that one for a while.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000]   I played that one for a while.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.000]   No, that one's great.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.280]   Well, Simone loves that one because she loves the horses.
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.280]   There's horses, yeah.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:40.280]   So true.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:41.280]   And she's a horse girl.
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:42.280]   All right.
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.360]   No points for that, but I appreciate you schooling, Simone.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.280]   So Christina, you had a very healthy 17 points.
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.280]   Uh-huh.
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:57.800]   You know, very strong showing at the end, but unfortunately, you're coming in at 15
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:58.800]   points.
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:56:59.800]   So...
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.800]   So it's two points.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.800]   Unfortunately.
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:03.800]   If I had only gotten that 3D consortium...
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:04.800]   I know.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.800]   No, we're not going to do it now, though.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:09.800]   We're going to save it.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:10.800]   We'll save it.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.800]   It's going to be in the closing credits of the show.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:13.800]   Yes.
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.000]   So stay tuned for the excitement.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.200]   You can sell the Frank Wu piece for these $8 to Fudgewood.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.200]   By the way, I have to point out, the whipped cream is melting.
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.200]   It's melted completely.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:24.200]   It's just going to be sloshed.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:26.680]   So really, you're going to be hitting me with a pile of cream.
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:27.680]   Right.
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:28.680]   Okay.
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:29.680]   Just to be clear.
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:30.680]   Put that in the fridge.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:31.680]   Oh my God.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:32.680]   It's too late.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:37.680]   I'd rather be hitting with a bowl of garlic soup if you had it.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:39.840]   All right.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:40.840]   Let's move on.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:41.840]   We can...
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:42.840]   So yeah, there she is.
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:44.880]   Oh, that's disgusting.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:46.040]   I'm starting to really regret this.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.040]   You should have played better.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.040]   I mean, this is all you.
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:49.040]   I had no idea.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:52.800]   I'm starting to really regret this.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:53.800]   I don't blame you.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:54.800]   No.
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:55.800]   I don't blame you.
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:58.120]   Because I did not know at all.
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:01.800]   And it also almost very nearly was... and I almost don't even feel like...
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.800]   I almost doesn't feel fair.
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:03.800]   We were so close.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:06.760]   I almost feel like either we both need to get hit in the face or...
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:07.760]   We could do it together.
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:08.760]   We could do it together.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:09.760]   We could do a little cream bath.
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:11.760]   Okay.
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.760]   We'll do that.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:15.960]   Just pretend I'm Henry Cavill and it'll be okay.
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:16.960]   All right?
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:17.960]   I love it.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:24.920]   Lisa and I were watching the new Jack Reacher and he's quite the hunk.
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:25.920]   He is.
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:26.920]   Yes.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:30.560]   He's not like Liam Hemsworth, but he's quite the hunk.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:33.520]   And I said, "Are you getting excited?"
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.520]   She says, "Wait till the shower scene."
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:37.520]   I said, "Okay."
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:40.280]   Kathy Griffin just shows you.
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:42.160]   Don't mess with Elno.
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.560]   She is now persona non grata.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:47.600]   Once again, didn't she get booted before?
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:48.600]   No.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:49.600]   She didn't.
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:50.600]   No.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:51.600]   She just lost a lot of work.
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:55.080]   She lost the New Year's Eve with Anderson Cooper, which frankly is... she's better
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:56.700]   off.
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:58.920]   But okay.
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.920]   So that's sad.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.920]   It is.
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:06.040]   And again, this goes back to again, five days ago, everything is fine.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:07.040]   Free speech, free speech.
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.040]   Free speech to everybody.
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:10.400]   And now if you impersonate anyone.
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:13.200]   And also to be clear, it's the display name.
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.160]   It's not like she changed her...
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.160]   It's still @KathyGriffin.
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:22.640]   It's not like she registered an account with E and a character that looks like an L.
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:26.400]   And by the way, here's a dirty little secret on the blue check.
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:27.400]   Which is an emoji.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.760]   You can do that anytime, right?
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:31.560]   Which she apparently did.
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:33.040]   Is it?
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:35.440]   Well, she's got it.
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.440]   You think...
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:37.440]   Oh, because she's @KathyGriffin.
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:38.440]   I mean, she's @KathyGriffin.
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.440]   Oh, that's very deceptive.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:40.440]   Yeah, I don't think it is.
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:41.440]   Well, okay.
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.200]   See, I'm confused because I'm a Mastodon.
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.200]   You can.
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.200]   Right.
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:46.200]   Ha.
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.200]   Everybody can.
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:51.200]   This is all deceptive, but it's also one of those things where these policies have
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.800]   been in place before, I think.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:54.800]   And then Elan was just like, everything goes.
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:56.120]   The impersonation.
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.440]   But I have to tell you, I've been impersonated.
[01:59:57.440 --> 01:59:59.200]   In fact, the reason the blue check started...
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.680]   Was, I was going to say, that's the whole reason I got mine.
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:02.680]   Tony LaRusso.
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:06.840]   So Tony LaRusso, who was the manager of the Cardinals, I think, at the time.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.800]   But before that, the Oakland A's.
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:12.800]   He sued Twitter because there was a Tony LaRusso impersonator.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:13.800]   Not illegal.
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:14.800]   Nope.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:15.800]   There were a lot of them.
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:19.720]   There were people impersonating you and me and Jeff Jarvis and all sorts of people.
[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:23.280]   But he sued and Twitter said, "We're going to win this one."
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:26.320]   And I think they got the judge to drop it because there was just no...
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320]   It's a dumb thing.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.240]   It's a public figure.
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:34.480]   But in the very moment that they did this, they announced the blue check.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:38.760]   And it's thought that this was really because they realized there is a problem with the
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:39.760]   impersonation.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:42.960]   And it should be the case that if you are following somebody on Twitter, there should
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:46.760]   be a way of verifying that's really who they say they are.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:51.720]   But it was also very much very quickly used as a status symbol and as a vanity thing.
[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:52.720]   Which is silly.
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:53.720]   It is.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:54.720]   But let's admit it, we all did it.
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:58.640]   The whole reason I got mine, they ended up verifying a lot of journalists, was that someone
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:03.960]   had been impersonating me and then I used that as the excuse to ask to get verified.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:04.960]   I didn't ask.
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:05.960]   It just happened.
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:06.960]   Oh, I absolutely.
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:08.440]   I'd asked for a while and then it showed up one day.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:11.000]   You were famous enough legitimately.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.320]   The idea is it was journalists, it was public figures, politicians.
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.320]   Celebrities.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.320]   Celebrities.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.320]   Okay.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.320]   Because they didn't want people to question about that.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.320]   I have a question about that.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:22.640]   Oprah joined Twitter on the show when Ashton was a guest and she signed up on Twitter.
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:24.720]   On the website, do you remember that?
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:25.720]   Yeah.
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:26.720]   Okay.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.400]   Because if Oprah joins and there's somebody who's already pretending to be Oprah, you
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:31.400]   can't have that.
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:32.400]   How should your name?
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:33.400]   Right.
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:34.400]   Yeah.
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:37.800]   So the website was much smaller at that point.
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:43.000]   Was the tenor of the impersonation different?
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.840]   Did it feel different than it is now when there's millions of users and the person who's
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.320]   doing that is probably a bad actor?
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:49.320]   I don't think so.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:51.760]   Because if you're impersonating somebody, you don't have a lot of followers.
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:52.760]   Right.
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:53.760]   I mean, it depends.
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:55.240]   I mean, yeah, unless you're very clear.
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:59.440]   I'm just saying in the context of like you all kind of came over from app.net together.
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:00.440]   I'm curious about it.
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.080]   No, we were there way before.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:03.080]   Like Twitter we were on like...
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.080]   2006, 2007.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:10.800]   So this is literally like for some people like a lifetime ago.
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.840]   And it was...
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:14.240]   But Twitter was small then.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:20.600]   And so, you know, if you were able to grab the username, I guess you could pretend to
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:22.560]   be someone that you weren't.
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:25.400]   But also back then it seemed funny.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:31.840]   Why would Britney Spears or Oprah or the president, why would they be on Twitter?
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:35.660]   Like I think like when the Tony LaRusso thing happened, it wasn't as if there were a lot
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:41.560]   of people who weren't early adopters in the tech space who were on this thing.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.200]   That's kind of what I'm wondering about it.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:46.480]   Because now it would obviously be a parody or something malicious.
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:50.260]   But back then was it seen as kind of, like you said, a joke of like, "Ha ha, imagine
[02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:55.200]   if this person were actually on Twitter when everyone knows Oprah's too big for Twitter."
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.200]   Yes, there were.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.520]   Well, what were some good parody accounts on Twitter?
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:00.520]   Do you remember?
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.440]   Well, there's still Devin Nunes' cowl.
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:03.440]   That's a famous one.
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.440]   Yeah, he sued.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:05.440]   He sued.
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:07.560]   Well, he was sued and that one was allowed to stay up.
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:08.560]   Like there was a lawsuit.
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:11.360]   But no, but there were a lot of parody ones.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.600]   Like the whole reason that Donald Trump is real Donald Trump is because people would
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:16.600]   register names.
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:17.600]   Which one, Brianna?
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:19.600]   The man who has it all accounts.
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:22.360]   The man who has it all accounts.
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:27.400]   It's the genre tiptoes had of women that have it all and it's like, but it's a man that
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:28.400]   has it all.
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:29.400]   It's great.
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:30.400]   Oh, that's got to be hard.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:33.400]   I don't know it.
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:34.400]   Yeah.
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:37.760]   Since I have elected not to pay $8, I guess I will lose my check.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:41.440]   Not that I care, but I don't see how that helps anybody.
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:47.080]   Well, but won't you have to pay for it for Twitter and all the associated Twitter accounts?
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:48.080]   Oh, we won't.
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:49.080]   We won't give them any money.
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.080]   No.
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:51.080]   Okay.
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.080]   What does it matter?
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:53.080]   I don't know.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:55.880]   Honestly, if we're up to me, which it's not, I would just tell the marketing department,
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:57.520]   please don't post on Twitter ever again.
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:03:59.040]   I've been saying that for years.
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:00.040]   What's the point?
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:03.320]   There's no, I don't think there's any value to it because it goes by.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:04.320]   Right?
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:05.320]   Who sees it?
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:08.800]   And if you see it and you know what it is, then you're already listening to our shows.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:12.440]   I don't see any point to marketing on Twitter at all.
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:16.200]   And I really baffles me that brands take this so seriously.
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.800]   I always tell on the radio show, I always tell the audience if you want to get action because
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:23.360]   you have a consumer problem with a brand, just tweet at them.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.400]   They take it really seriously for no good reason.
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:28.440]   No one's seeing that tweet.
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:31.200]   It's not damaging their reputation.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:32.400]   Is it?
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:34.280]   They see it because you're at them.
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:35.280]   I don't know.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:36.280]   I think it can be.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.480]   I think it is definitely.
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.960]   I also think that it is interesting the way that brands and it started with Comcast and
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:46.400]   then it went into a lot of others, started to use Twitter as a...
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.400]   Comcast Cares, very famous.
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:48.400]   Yes, very famous.
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:49.400]   This was a guy who...
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:50.400]   Frank.
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:51.400]   Frank, yeah.
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:55.200]   Just a normal guy at Comcast who created a Comcast Cares Twitter account to handle
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:57.520]   the backlash against a company that frankly most of us have...
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:58.520]   And it did help them.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.520]   It did help them a ton.
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:00.520]   But that was a long time ago.
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:05.200]   Delta, and they don't do this anymore, I don't think, but for many, many years, they ran
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.520]   a huge amount of their customer service stuff through Twitter and it was plugged into their
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:09.520]   other CRM systems.
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:10.520]   That's such a mistake.
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:11.520]   No, it was great.
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.240]   It was much faster to get in touch with people rather than calling.
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:19.520]   You could tweet and you could get in the DMs and it was pre-ChatOps.
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:21.920]   Right now, ChatOps is the thing that you would do.
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:25.720]   You would do things on WhatsApp or iMessage or whatever the case may be, but you could
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:29.680]   use Twitter for that and it was a great way for them to deal with customer complaints
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:34.640]   and you could do things a lot faster than otherwise.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:38.960]   Also, there were moments because people would...
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:43.200]   Things would go viral and this still happens where customer service, customer fail incidents
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:46.360]   go viral and that's a nightmare for a company.
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:47.360]   Steakums.
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:49.800]   Steakums has a great account.
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:50.800]   Steakums does.
[02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:53.360]   I don't know if it makes you want to eat Steakums.
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:54.360]   Probably not.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:56.720]   I'm not sure I even know what Steakums is.
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:59.920]   It's like your sausage fingers only in a delicious sandwich.
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:02.440]   Oh, well now you have my attention.
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.440]   Yeah.
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:05.880]   Steakums doesn't talk about Steakums usually.
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:06.880]   You're right.
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:11.640]   It does go viral when a brand does something clever because we usually expect brands to
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:12.640]   be stupid.
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.440]   Yeah, no, no, but also if something bad happens, that goes viral too.
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:17.200]   Like if there's a terrible customer service thing, that can become trending.
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:18.200]   It could go bad.
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:19.200]   Maybe that's what they're worried about.
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:20.200]   It could go bad.
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:21.200]   Well, it used to.
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.200]   I think now maybe it's not as much of a thing anymore, but it used to be a thing.
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:25.160]   It's certainly not going to be going forward under Elon, right?
[02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:28.760]   Probably not, but historically it was definitely a problem.
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:31.800]   You didn't want to see your company trending for the wrong reason.
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:32.800]   Right?
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:39.280]   I'm very proud to say I am not going to ban the account that tracks my private jet.
[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:40.280]   Well, it's public.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:43.720]   Look, I think that account is gross and I think stalking people is gross, but it's public
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:44.720]   data.
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:49.200]   He says, he just tweeted this by the way, even though that is a direct personal safety
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:50.200]   risk.
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:51.200]   See what a good man I am.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.200]   Right.
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:55.080]   And it's public information that you're getting directly from the FAA.
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:07:00.400]   So Leo, you touched on this earlier, the Neil I.
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:02.240]   Patel article in The Verge.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:03.720]   Welcome to hell, Elon.
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:04.720]   Elon.
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:08.160]   And we come back to that again.
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:13.600]   He has banned somebody for impersonating him, Kathy Griffin, and now he is stuck in this
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:16.480]   position where he has to say, "No, I am so committed to free speech.
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:18.560]   Look, look, the private jet account staying up."
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:20.560]   He's stuck, isn't he?
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:21.560]   Poor guy.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:26.940]   When was the last time we saw somebody flailing like this and attempting to explain the logic
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:31.120]   of the company that they're running on that company's platform?
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:32.120]   It's a mess.
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:33.120]   It's a messy.
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:34.120]   Yeah.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:35.120]   Okay.
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.120]   Remember when the guy was dragged off of the United flight?
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:38.120]   Oh, yes.
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:40.120]   That one's viral on Twitter.
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.120]   Okay.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.120]   No, you're right.
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:43.120]   No, you're right.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:47.520]   In fact, Jeff Jarvis will always bring this up when we talk about the hellscape that Facebook
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:50.800]   and Twitter and Instagram are.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:55.380]   And he said, "Yeah, but think of with a word for Facebook, we wouldn't have seen the George
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:07:56.380]   Floyd video."
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:57.380]   Right.
[02:07:57.380 --> 02:08:03.240]   And of course, I don't want to paint any technology as bad.
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:07.200]   I feel like Twitter has somewhat lost its credibility.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:08.200]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:12.080]   By the way, this is going to happen to Facebook this week.
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:14.360]   Thousands of employees will be laid off.
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:21.040]   So, in fact, I think probably Mark Zuckerberg said, "Oh, great.
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:27.240]   Elon just laid off 3,000 people quick, send out the email."
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:29.960]   Did they notify them a month in advance?
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:30.960]   Yeah.
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:31.960]   Well, that's right.
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:33.440]   The Warn Act says you have to give them 60 days.
[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:36.920]   If it's a certain percentage, I think.
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:39.600]   I have hopes though that this is going to be a different situation.
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:43.080]   I obviously feel terrible for anyone, but Simone, you mentioned this earlier.
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:45.520]   Stripe also had layoffs this week.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:50.560]   The way they handled it was such a complete difference from the way that Twitter did.
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:57.000]   And I hope, certainly for anyone who's impacted by Facebook's layoffs, that it goes much more
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.520]   similar to what Stripe did.
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:00.600]   And I think that it probably will be.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:03.280]   Well, it is interesting.
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:05.720]   These are huge companies.
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:08.680]   Twitter, Stripe, Facebook.
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:11.520]   Wasn't there another company that had layoffs this past week as well?
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:13.520]   Yeah, there have been a couple.
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:15.520]   Yeah, there have been a lot.
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:18.720]   The recruiters in the tech world must be going nuts right now.
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:20.720]   And where are all these people going to go?
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:24.680]   Yeah, but we're also in a tech recession to a certain extent right now.
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:26.720]   This is why Facebook laid off people, right?
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:27.720]   But they've also hired.
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:33.200]   I mean, there is the argument to be made that they were over hiring to a degree beyond.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:34.200]   Lyft just laid off a bunch of them.
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.720]   Lyft, that's who it was.
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:39.240]   It's interesting because we'll have to see how this shakes out.
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:42.840]   And it's harder when you see some of the really big companies doing it.
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:45.440]   But there is still a shortage of tech workers.
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:50.000]   And we don't have enough people to have tech jobs.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.280]   But that, I realize, is not at all solace to anyone who's lost their job.
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:56.040]   And I'm not trying to say that it is.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:59.560]   But we're in this weird situation where you might have some of the bigger companies that
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:04.920]   have to get smaller, but the industry itself is still...
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:06.400]   There aren't enough people.
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:10.200]   In your role as developer advocate, you talk probably to a lot of developers at GitHub.
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.200]   Yes, all the time.
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:13.800]   What's the general feeling?
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.120]   We have a good skill that we will be employable and we're not going to worry about it?
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:19.120]   I think it's a mix.
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.480]   I think it depends on how long people have been in the industry and what their focus
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:23.480]   area is.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:26.440]   Because it's obviously a really difficult time right now.
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:27.880]   There's a lot of unease in the economy.
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:29.640]   And I think everybody feels uncomfortable.
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.200]   And I don't know if anybody feels safe.
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:33.440]   And so I think there's that sense.
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:37.520]   But I do also think that one of the reasons we've seen a lot of people move into tech and
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:38.520]   upskill...
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:41.600]   You were mentioning one of your sponsors earlier, teaching people skills.
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:45.560]   And this becomes a really important thing to continue learning and continue growing so
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:50.360]   that you can take on jobs at other places as they come up.
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.760]   I have to think in the long run.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:57.000]   You have, as a developer or an engineer of any kind, you have such a high level of skill
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.400]   and training in most cases.
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.040]   Unless you're really junior.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.480]   You've got to be valuable to an economy that's run by technology.
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:05.480]   100%.
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:09.040]   But again, I think it comes down to how are you willing to continue to learning and upskilling?
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:10.400]   And this is what I tell people all the time.
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:12.400]   You have to keep up to date.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:13.400]   Yes.
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:16.280]   But if you're a COBOL developer, you might be able to find a job.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.280]   Yeah, you might.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:21.600]   But also keep in mind that if everybody just stayed with COBOL and hadn't learned other
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.200]   things, then we'd have a glut of people and not enough jobs for them.
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:27.000]   So I think now it's very specialized.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.720]   It's very specialized right now.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:32.360]   Whereas 20 years ago, that might not have been a great place.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.040]   So I think now it becomes if what you're doing is...
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:44.200]   If you've become maybe overly comfortable, maybe just work on upskilling if you need
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:46.640]   to learn a new area they're not familiar with or...
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:49.000]   Learn a new language?
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000]   Learn a new skill?
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000]   A new technology?
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000]   I don't know if it's like language is necessarily...
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000]   Learn a new framework?
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.960]   I think new frameworks, but also making sure that you're up to date on one of the latest
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:56.960]   practices are.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:59.720]   Like the development practices have changed a lot even in the last decade.
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:00.720]   That's the good news.
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:01.720]   It's constantly changing.
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:02.720]   It is.
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:03.720]   Which I think...
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:06.200]   And that's one of the things I say to people too is that show that you're willing to
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:07.200]   learn.
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:09.600]   Show that you're willing to evolve because that...
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:14.240]   Even if you are going into a job and you don't know the language, if you show, "Hey, I have
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:17.120]   the experience being able to pick things up really quickly and I'm willing to put the
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:19.040]   work into it," that goes a long way.
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:25.440]   Kevin Rose, his ears must be burning by now, always said that he hired somebody more for
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:29.560]   their ability to learn, their interest in learning, not for their existing skill set,
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:30.640]   but their desire to get...
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:31.640]   That's brilliant.
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:32.640]   100%.
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:37.880]   Their intelligence, right? Because then you know you can learn another skill.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:43.280]   So if you're a Ruby developer and we're doing Python, but you have this desire to learn
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.800]   and grow and you've always stayed up to date, then I'm going to hire you because I need
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:48.800]   somebody smart.
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:51.760]   That's more important than somebody who knows Python because you can learn Python.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:52.760]   You can learn Python.
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:53.800]   I think it becomes...
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:55.880]   Are you willing to be agile in that way?
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:56.880]   Are you willing to evolve?
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:58.360]   And some people want to do the same...
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:12:59.360]   Or not.
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.360]   Right.
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:01.360]   Which is okay.
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:03.640]   When I talk to developers, we try to encourage.
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:04.640]   We want to continue learning.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.040]   I know that's how I feel about my own career.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:13.040]   This is not quite as good as a diploma from Ivy League University, but I do have to give
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:20.480]   you the Twit versus Rocket showdown plaque thanks to Frank Wu.
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:21.480]   Thank you, Frank.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:22.480]   Yep.
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:23.480]   And I'll be getting the pie.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:24.480]   You'll be getting the pie.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:25.480]   A little later on.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:26.480]   A little later on.
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:27.600]   We also have a badge though, so that's good.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:31.160]   I want to do the badge, but I'm going to save that because we really got to get some tech
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:32.160]   news in here.
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.160]   Of course.
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:34.160]   We got to do more news for sure.
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:37.360]   Finally, is it the end for the fax machine?
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:40.320]   There is a...
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:47.360]   The UK telecoms regulator, Ofcom, is considering whether to remove fax services from the list
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:51.600]   of technologies that requires telecom communities to support.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:58.280]   We've also heard a Japanese agency which used to require faxes starting to think about maybe
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:01.880]   we won't require faxes anymore.
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:08.920]   There are still plenty of industries, banking, home loans in the United States.
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:11.960]   It's amazing you buy a house, you have to fax a lot of stuff.
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:15.760]   There's still companies that like those faxes.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:17.920]   Is it the end of the line for the fax machine?
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:19.440]   God, I hope so.
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:25.320]   I was really confused by this piece because I guess I didn't understand.
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:27.640]   You've got the fax protocol, right?
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:28.920]   It's out there.
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:36.960]   What support do we need in 2022 from the telecom companies to support fax?
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:39.760]   That was the part of it I didn't understand.
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:47.960]   Is it mandated that certain emergency services have to have a fax machine?
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.440]   The protocol is mature.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:52.960]   I don't think it's probably being built on today.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:55.920]   What do we need from telecom companies on this?
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.960]   It just works over a regular phone line.
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:14:59.960]   That's the thing.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:00.960]   It's frustrating.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:05.720]   I think the service went out of business, but I subscribed for well over a decade a fax
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:10.960]   to email system where basically I could send an email to a certain number and they would
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.720]   fax it.
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:13.720]   I would basically just send.
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:14.720]   E-fax or J-fax.
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:18.680]   It was similar to that, but it costs less than those.
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:23.680]   It was one of those things where I could just say, "Okay, I can send you an email with the
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:30.200]   PDF attached and what number I need," and then they would fax it for me.
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:34.480]   At this point, I understand, I guess, in theory saying, "Oh, well, we all have these machines
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:40.200]   and this protocol, but can we all just use whatever the doc you sign or whatever those
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:41.200]   things are?"
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:42.200]   Yeah.
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:43.200]   I wish more people would use that.
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:44.200]   I don't understand.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:45.200]   That seems more secure.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:48.280]   A signature is not a very secure way to verify identity.
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:57.000]   I'm looking at the OFCOM, the British regulators bulletin on this, and they don't say what specific
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:05.280]   technologies, but they point out that many networks are migrating to IP technology, which
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:11.400]   means fax services will no longer work in the same way on an IP network.
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:16.000]   Fax was always designed to work as a sound over a voice network.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:22.680]   Apparently, there's something about IP-based networks that doesn't work as well.
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:26.600]   The OFCOM says if you're moving to IP, that's fine.
[02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:29.480]   You don't have to worry about faxes.
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:34.460]   It reflects that the use of fax services in the UK is very limited and there are a range
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:37.360]   of free or low-cost alternatives available.
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:44.000]   Faxes were created in Japan, I think, because you didn't have an easy way to print a document
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000]   in Japanese.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000]   Right.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.760]   So you could write it and then send it.
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:57.960]   I could also see it with like, if you're trying to compress that sound file, maybe there are
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:03.880]   certain parts of the protocol that just aren't audible to us and they're restrained on bandwidth
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:05.280]   trying to support this.
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.980]   I think that's plausible.
[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:14.400]   There is that issue of not wanting to disadvantage people who don't have a high level of technology.
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:19.160]   Australia tried to kill fax machines in hospitals two years ago.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:23.960]   Doctors would wait around to receive documents in the fax machine because at the time they
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:24.960]   weren't computerized.
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:26.840]   They didn't have practice management software.
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:28.600]   They didn't have computers in their room.
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:29.600]   Two years ago?
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:30.600]   Yeah.
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:31.600]   Well, 2019, three years ago.
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:32.600]   Okay.
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:33.600]   It's weird that they didn't.
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:34.600]   Because here's the thing.
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:37.480]   I could have bought that argument like 10 years ago, right?
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:38.560]   15 years ago.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.320]   Now it's difficult for me to sort of believe this because at this point, I think that it
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:49.200]   would almost be a much bigger hurdle to say that you need a hardwired landline in a fax
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:50.200]   machine.
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:57.240]   Unless it were already a rule and they weren't allowed to send documents purely digitally.
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:17:58.720]   I could see that maybe being a holdover.
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:17:59.720]   For privacy, right?
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:00.720]   Privacy.
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:01.720]   Yeah.
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:02.720]   But again, that's why you have like these documents.
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:04.200]   I mean, they should have changed it to be clear a long time ago.
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:05.200]   However.
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:07.440]   Is sending it over a fax really any more safe?
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:08.440]   I mean, that could be intercepted.
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:11.160]   And if it goes to the wrong number, if it goes...
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:12.160]   You know what I mean?
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:13.440]   There's a lot of things that could go wrong.
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:14.680]   How many times...
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:18.320]   Even today, every once in a while somebody will have your number as a fax number.
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:19.320]   Right.
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:21.280]   And you'll pick up and it's beep, beep, beep.
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:22.280]   Has that happened to you recently?
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:23.280]   Not in a while.
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:24.280]   Not in a while.
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:26.600]   At least it was happening at least like six months ago.
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:27.600]   Somebody kept calling your number.
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:28.600]   Literally never happened to me.
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:29.600]   Never?
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.560]   Was there some kind of drama with fax machines in the last election cycle over here?
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:37.840]   Am I inventing a scenario from...
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:40.720]   When you say over here, do you mean in this or on the planet Earth?
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:41.720]   In the US.
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:44.720]   Yeah, over here on the planet Earth where I live.
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:45.720]   Okay.
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:46.720]   No, that's not ringing a bell for anyone else.
[02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:47.720]   So I must have made it up.
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:48.720]   Never mind.
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:49.720]   Okay.
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:51.160]   You get phone calls from fax machines?
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:52.160]   What?
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:53.160]   Yeah.
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:54.160]   Don't you?
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:55.160]   I guess not.
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:56.160]   It's a famous episode of Seinfeld.
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:57.160]   Let me ask you this, Simone.
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:58.160]   Yeah.
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:01.160]   Do you have a landline, Simone?
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:02.160]   No.
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.160]   That's why you don't get fax calls.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.160]   Oh.
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:05.160]   Okay.
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:06.160]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:07.160]   Yeah.
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:08.160]   Okay.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:09.160]   But see, this is also sort of the point that I'm having.
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:10.160]   Like no one has a landline.
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:12.680]   Like I haven't had a landline and I don't know how long.
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:17.720]   So if your business is already established, I guess, but I also kind of figure like maybe
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:19.720]   you should modernize for a lot of reasons.
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:23.720]   Well, but I feel like there's a reason for a business to have a landline.
[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:25.240]   And does it mean they should be faxing things?
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:27.120]   No, but most businesses don't have landlines.
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:28.120]   They have IP lines.
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:29.120]   Yeah, we have IP.
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:30.120]   We have Telefine, etc.
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:31.120]   Right.
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:32.120]   Yeah.
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:33.120]   It's actually...
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:35.160]   At this point, I don't know why you would have like a regular landline of your business.
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:38.240]   You would have a PBX.
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:43.360]   The lovely Brendan Carr, one of the five commissioners at the Federal Communications Commission told
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:48.960]   Axios in an interview that we should ban TikTok in the United States.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:53.200]   Fortunately, Carr is just one of five.
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:57.160]   But does that seem FCC?
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:04.880]   I love Mike Madsen's response, which is Carr, who has resolutely refused to do what the
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:10.120]   FCC is supposed to do, which is protect privacy and safety with the telecom companies.
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:16.360]   Instead, wants to ban TikTok, which he has absolutely no oversight of.
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:18.800]   The FCC has no authority to regulate TikTok.
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:19.800]   Yep.
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:20.800]   Or should they?
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:21.800]   Or should they?
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:27.080]   You know who does though is Cepheus, the Council on Foreign Investment in the US.
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:31.440]   And he's saying they should ban it.
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:32.440]   We don't agree with that.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:34.600]   We were talking about TikTok and propaganda.
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:36.760]   I think it's all Red Scare BS.
[02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:37.760]   Red Scare.
[02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:46.520]   Like I don't downplay like I think there is maybe an ideological danger there, but I think
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:49.640]   it is massively overplayed.
[02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:54.520]   And I think honestly, at its core, this is a reaction like so many of our large social
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:57.840]   networks in the US are US founded.
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.240]   Obviously, that's very different in China, where there's a lot of like state owned social
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:05.240]   networks that are massive that we don't have access to over here.
[02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:10.480]   I think this is a knee jerk reaction of fear to being like, "Wait, this is tangentially
[02:21:10.480 --> 02:21:12.200]   this is related to their social networks.
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:14.720]   We can't have that here."
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:15.720]   And I don't know.
[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:18.240]   It's very silly, I think.
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:20.800]   Yeah, I have to say I agree.
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.800]   I feel like it disagrees with me.
[02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:25.080]   I should accuse myself.
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:26.600]   It's not that I disagree.
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:27.600]   It's that...
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:30.040]   How can I put this?
[02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:32.880]   It's not that I think TikTok is a unique threat.
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:37.560]   I do think there's national security stuff we've not thought about with social media.
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:41.120]   I was talking about earlier in the show, I think it carries over to TikTok.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:47.360]   I also have to say, I'm married to someone who has Chinese parents, I have Chinese relatives,
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:49.960]   I was just hanging out with them this week.
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:57.840]   And just in China, there's a completely different approach to how they see privacy and the way
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:58.840]   that...
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:05.440]   Yeah, they take pride in their companies in a way that I don't hear us talking about,
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:07.720]   you know, Facebook and Reddit.
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:09.360]   It's just not in the same way.
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:12.240]   And it is synonymous with the government to a certain extent.
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:16.320]   So I don't want to dismiss those fears.
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:22.920]   I just want a standard that Facebook and Reddit and all these other sites are held to as well.
[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:25.560]   I do think we need to start thinking about NatSec.
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:30.920]   I do think we need to start thinking about your control of your own data over there.
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:34.760]   And I just think there's a wider conversation to be had here.
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:35.760]   Fair enough.
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:36.760]   Yeah.
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:41.920]   Especially as we go into an election year coming up in a couple years, I think misinformation
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:45.160]   is going to be again, a huge problem.
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:52.840]   I don't necessarily see that as like a China specific danger.
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:56.520]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:02.280]   I think this is one where you can also say the dangers in the house is inside the house.
[02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:03.280]   Yes.
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:06.440]   I will say, look, I think that one of the bothersome things to me about TikTok is that
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:09.600]   there has been some evidence that it looks like it's essentially kind of a keylogger.
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:13.600]   A lot of the things that the app does to track you, which I think is really gross.
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:19.360]   Do I think that the government should be getting involved in banning it for whatever reasons?
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:21.760]   That I don't really agree with.
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:26.000]   But if there are things, for instance, happening on a platform level where they're doing things
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.800]   that they're not disclosing, then honestly, that is a great opportunity for Apple or Google
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:35.120]   to kind of step in and saying, hey, you're not disclosing this or this information that
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:36.120]   is getting shared.
[02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:38.160]   To ban them from the app store.
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:39.560]   Well, yeah, because here's the thing.
[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:46.880]   If you're essentially doing a keylogger and doing everything that people are doing within
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:52.120]   that app and capturing every minute option, you're not letting people know that.
[02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:53.120]   That I think-
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:55.120]   That violates the app store rules.
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:56.120]   Exactly.
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:58.960]   So that to me is really problematic.
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:04.560]   And I understand that there might be some concerns about the way that these platforms
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:07.680]   could be leveraged and used by foreign parties.
[02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:15.680]   But I also, I don't know, I'm not ever going to think that our government has the capability
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.680]   to enforce these things the right way or understand the technology well enough.
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:22.800]   Or that we want to give them that right.
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:27.080]   It's a slippery slope to state-run media, state-run social networks right there.
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:32.160]   And we know that Facebook was used to manipulate and has been used for years to manipulate
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:33.760]   the electorate.
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:34.760]   Very clearly.
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:36.760]   You're going to ban Facebook?
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:37.760]   Yeah.
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:38.760]   Right.
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:39.760]   Well, now you're onto something.
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:41.400]   Maybe we should just get rid of all social media.
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:43.400]   You won't find a-
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:44.920]   Take it back around.
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:47.440]   Nobody ever tried to influence an election on mastodon.
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:48.960]   I can tell you that right now.
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:49.960]   Not yet.
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:50.960]   Not yet, baby.
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:54.240]   I just want to be really clear here for everyone listening or watching.
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:56.280]   I'm not saying we should ban TikTok.
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:00.560]   I'm saying there are real national security concerns.
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:02.120]   We need to take those seriously.
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:03.120]   That's all I'm saying.
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:04.120]   Absolutely.
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:07.360]   Like democracy is really under attack around the world.
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:09.200]   Name a country.
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:10.560]   Bad stuff is happening.
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:14.680]   Strong men are winning all around the world.
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:17.960]   This is a real problem and we've got to start thinking about it.
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:18.960]   Yeah.
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:19.960]   Well, I don't disagree.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:24.600]   I just feel like TikTok is probably the worst way to do that where you can really get the
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:29.240]   job done on Twitter and Facebook and other places.
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:32.320]   TikTok is just a bunch of cat videos and stuff.
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:33.320]   No, not entirely.
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:34.320]   It is a-
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:35.320]   Information medium.
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:39.240]   No, but it is also radicalizing people in certain ways.
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:41.200]   More than YouTube?
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:42.200]   For some groups, yeah.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.640]   I think it's the same way YouTube is because what happens is the algorithm is so much better
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:50.720]   than YouTube or Twitter or other things that it will get you into the same sort of self-perpetuating
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:51.720]   thing.
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:54.640]   I think that's the fear, but I don't think that's something that we should be legislating
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:57.160]   just because of the company, the country that-
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:59.040]   It's not about China.
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:00.040]   It's about the algorithm.
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:01.040]   Right.
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:02.040]   Yeah.
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:03.040]   The algorithm-
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:04.040]   Oh, gone.
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:05.040]   No, please, Simone.
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:08.960]   I was just going to say that there are accounts on TikTok that are news accounts, but it's
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:12.720]   like a person summarizing and-
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:14.480]   You knocked your cable loose there.
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:15.480]   Yep.
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:16.480]   I just hit my microphone in the exact way to turn it off.
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:17.480]   That's the sausage fingers.
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:18.480]   It's very hard to keep them-
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:19.480]   Oh, no.
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:20.480]   Oh, God.
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:23.480]   You think I'd be safe podcasting with these sausage fingers?
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:25.320]   She can't play the break of the wind.
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:26.880]   She's going to just ruin it.
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:27.880]   All right.
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:28.880]   You can hear me now though.
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.880]   Yes.
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:31.240]   Okay, great.
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:36.240]   People who have designated themselves reputable experts and are spinning the news in their
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:38.320]   own way, just like on YouTube.
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:45.040]   I do see it, as you said, Christina, as a related problem because it's a social media-wide
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:51.160]   problem where we are choosing to get our news from these very niche, non-expert sources
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:53.960]   and it's not TikTok specific at all.
[02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:54.960]   It's funny.
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:57.680]   Carr is scared because TikTok is owned by the Chinese government, but I'm more with
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:26:58.680]   you, Christina.
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:02.560]   I'm scared because the algorithm is so spot on.
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:03.560]   Yes.
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:09.840]   I was talking to my daughter who was 30, she said, I said, "People don't use TikTok for
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:10.840]   search."
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:11.840]   Yeah, they do.
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:12.840]   She said, "Oh, yeah, they do."
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:13.840]   She said, "Try it."
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:14.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:16.520]   I said, "Well, look, what if I want to know how old the Golden Gate Bridge was?"
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:17.520]   She said, "Just try it."
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:20.760]   I searched TikTok and I found a bunch of videos in the building of the Golden Gate Bridge,
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:24.440]   how old the Golden Gate Bridge- so yeah, I could see why maybe the same way you'd search
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:27.040]   YouTube for some information, you might search TikTok.
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:31.680]   Well, yeah, because YouTube is the number two search engine and TikTok, I'm sure, is probably
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:32.680]   climbing.
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:37.560]   That's what they're doing with Douyin right now too, right?
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:42.560]   In China, you can use Douyin at discounts at restaurants and you can find restaurant
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:48.680]   recommendations and read reviews all through the app and it is used for search in that
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:49.680]   way.
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:50.680]   That is a China-only TikTok.
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:52.160]   That's potential development of TikTok.
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:54.600]   Yeah, yeah, sorry.
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:59.000]   She also pointed out that, and I talked to now a number of people who have multiple TikTok
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:05.040]   accounts because the algorithm is so good that if they want to see cooking videos on
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:08.840]   their one account, that's all they're going to ever see.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:13.760]   If they want to see something else, they'll have another account that's for the car videos.
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:15.760]   Do you do that?
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:16.760]   Christina, you're nodding.
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:18.280]   I've heard of people doing this.
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:22.480]   I haven't, but I've thought about it actually.
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:27.960]   It's so good that anything you do on it- my daughter says, "Oh, if you see a video that
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:33.480]   doesn't have this content free, don't waste, don't mop for one second.
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:38.960]   Swipe immediately because the algorithm will know that you watched this even if it's for
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:43.800]   a second and that will prioritize some kinds of videos by doing that."
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:44.800]   Right.
[02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:49.280]   It's interesting to juxtapose that with YouTube, which YouTube is basically based on what you're
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:50.680]   recently into, right?
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:54.560]   It has some historical things, but YouTube will show you similar things to what you've
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:59.760]   been searching for in the last few days, few weeks, but it will change over time because
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:02.760]   as you search for different things, it'll show you those new things you're obsessed
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:03.760]   with.
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:05.800]   Whereas TikTok, yes, it does seem to keep you in the same-
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:07.360]   It's like a flywheel.
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:12.920]   It's instant, it's fast, and it's strong.
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:18.840]   She thinks she notices different response depending on the time of day.
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:21.640]   If you had one account, what you watch in the morning, you're going to see again in
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:27.720]   the morning what you watch in the evening, you're going to see again in the evening.
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:28.720]   Maybe it's too good an algorithm.
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:32.840]   So, I'm more afraid of that than I am of China.
[02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:39.440]   Can I posit something from a 30,000 foot video?
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:48.120]   If you think about humans through all of history, we are overdosing on dopamine in a way in
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:54.120]   modern life, in a way that is completely unprecedented through all of human history.
[02:29:54.120 --> 02:30:01.400]   Think about just access to looking at beautiful people online.
[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:06.880]   You would have had to be a pharaoh or a queen in Egypt to have anything compared to what
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:10.720]   a 12-year-old boy can get today online all the time.
[02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:12.420]   We have so much dopamine.
[02:30:12.420 --> 02:30:15.440]   The Twitter algorithm is like wired.
[02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:19.560]   The reason Christine and I are so addicted to it is because it is fine-tuned to addicting
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:20.560]   us.
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:25.840]   What you're talking about with TikTok, this is so awesome at getting you to stay in this
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:30.280]   flow and watch these cute videos and it's not a negative experience in the same way.
[02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:32.520]   Dopamine, dopamine, dopamine.
[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:39.280]   At some point, we have to start asking ourselves, "Okay, so the algorithm, we can tailor this
[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:42.000]   to give us tons of dopamine."
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.120]   We know that.
[02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:49.080]   At what point do we start asking questions like, "Is this good for society?
[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:51.080]   Is this affecting national security?
[02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:55.360]   Is this leaving us lonely or does this make us vulnerable for misinformation?"
[02:30:55.360 --> 02:31:00.960]   I do think that there needs to be more transparency with the way these algorithms are used by
[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:06.460]   these companies because right now, they're geared for one thing, addiction.
[02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:09.160]   It's not serving our culture well.
[02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:11.900]   I do think it's time to take that seriously.
[02:31:11.900 --> 02:31:17.240]   Would you say, how would you do that if you were going to enact a law?
[02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:18.240]   Would you ban algorithms?
[02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:20.000]   I ran for Congress trying to do this.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.480]   I wanted to serve on the Science, Space and Technology Committee and have hearings on
[02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:25.480]   these algorithms.
[02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:32.600]   I would like to bring in smart people to look at more public disclosure about how they tweak
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:33.600]   those things.
[02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:34.600]   This is age-old.
[02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:37.680]   I do think there needs to be more discussion.
[02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:43.000]   We became a vast wasteland, I talked about Gilligan's Island, because they noticed ratings
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:46.000]   were higher for dumb shows.
[02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:52.440]   Right, but there's also a pendulum swing because Gilligan's Island was canceled, so was the
[02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:53.440]   Brady Bunch.
[02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:54.440]   They found other dumb shows.
[02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:55.440]   No.
[02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:56.440]   Television then has entered...
[02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:57.440]   Did it get smarter?
[02:31:57.440 --> 02:31:58.440]   It has over time.
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:31:59.440]   Think about it.
[02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:05.560]   Look, within a couple of years of Gilligan's Island, you had the Mary Tyler Moore Show,
[02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:07.920]   which was on the same network.
[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:11.200]   In fact, Grant Tinker was famous for revamping...
[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:12.200]   CBS.
[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:13.200]   CBS and making it smarter.
[02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:14.200]   Yes.
[02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:15.200]   Very successful.
[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:16.200]   You had it all on the family.
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:17.200]   Again, the normal year stuff.
[02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:19.480]   But that's still more algorithm.
[02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:20.480]   It's a human-based algorithm.
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:22.440]   But it's still more, "Let's look at ratings.
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:23.960]   Let's see what we can do."
[02:32:23.960 --> 02:32:25.080]   But it's all based...
[02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:27.240]   The difference in technology is it's an instant.
[02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:28.240]   Right.
[02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:33.280]   World of Warcraft, they know exactly what loot drops bring you back in there.
[02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:36.600]   Maybe we need more of a human element in at least some of the curation things.
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:37.600]   It is slower.
[02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:38.600]   Maybe it needs to be.
[02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:42.960]   There's definitely more smart TV right now than there has been.
[02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:47.040]   But there's also Love is Blind Season 3, which is great.
[02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:49.320]   And I'm glad we have both.
[02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:50.320]   Is that about vampires?
[02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:51.320]   Oh, no.
[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:55.000]   It's a dating show that is...
[02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:56.000]   It's fantastic.
[02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.000]   Is it reality?
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000]   It is.
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000]   The Nick and...
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000]   Oh my God.
[02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:02.000]   I just forgot her name.
[02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000]   Nora?
[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000]   Vanessa?
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000]   Oh.
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.600]   Oh, I wish it were Nick and Nora Charles.
[02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:07.600]   Come on.
[02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:08.600]   Give me a show about them.
[02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:10.600]   Oh, I just searched for Love is Blind.
[02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:11.600]   That was wrong.
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:13.040]   Love is Blind.
[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:20.320]   Raven and Eskay share what Season 3 didn't show about their relationship following wedding
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:21.320]   decision.
[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:22.320]   Oh my God.
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:23.320]   Don't spoil me.
[02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:25.440]   I've only got episode 3.
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:26.560]   Let me ask you something.
[02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:29.000]   What's the premise of this reality show?
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.600]   The premise of this reality show is that there are people who have not succeeded in finding
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:39.800]   love and agree to undergo a very rigorous experiment where they are put into pods and they can
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:43.600]   talk to a bunch of singles who they cannot see.
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:46.160]   Oh, I get the blind part.
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:48.400]   It's like the voice.
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:49.400]   Exactly.
[02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:50.400]   But you're dating.
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:51.400]   Yep.
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:52.400]   Okay.
[02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:55.940]   And then you hit a button, your chair turns around or your pod opens up and you could
[02:33:55.940 --> 02:33:58.160]   see who you fell in love with.
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:03.520]   And then do people like see the person they go, "Oh."
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:04.520]   Sometimes.
[02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:05.520]   Yeah.
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:06.520]   And it's always horrifying.
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:08.520]   But they always pick good looking people, don't they?
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:09.520]   No?
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:10.520]   Well, they do actually.
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:11.520]   They do.
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:14.960]   I'm just saying it's not always what other people like.
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:16.960]   And you all three, you were hooked on this?
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.280]   Simone and I like this sort of trash.
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:20.280]   Brianna probably is.
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:24.960]   I may watch less trash TV than Christina and Simone.
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:29.880]   Simone and I are also really big on the 90 Day Fiance universe.
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:33.920]   My point is not certainly that anyone should watch Love is Blind.
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:36.920]   Don't be like me.
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:43.720]   Like if you look at the Netflix homepage right now, there is a lot of digestible trash reality
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:44.720]   or reality TV.
[02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:46.400]   Some of that's because it's cheap to make.
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:47.400]   It's cheap to make.
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:48.400]   Westworld was just canceled.
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:49.400]   And they need content to fill that platform.
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:52.000]   Yeah, Westworld was extremely expensive.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.840]   But Westworld also was extremely incomprehensible.
[02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:58.960]   Well Westworld was probably really a good two season show and probably if we're honest.
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:01.600]   I mean I'm sad it was canceled but it was also probably time.
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:02.600]   Yeah.
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:03.600]   Nobody was watching it anymore.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:04.800]   Season three and four were so good.
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:06.720]   I'm so bummed about this.
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:10.880]   Season five, they were really going to an interesting place.
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:19.080]   But I think you do see a desire for the return to the golden age of quotation marks of TV.
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:23.080]   Breaking Bad is something that has crept back into the conversation.
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:30.640]   I think partially because it would I think be hard to make a show like that in this climate
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.520]   where everything is on a streaming service that is trying to like gain, gain, gain subscribers
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:37.680]   and stop that bleed.
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:39.260]   They have a different mission.
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:40.260]   They don't sell advertising.
[02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:46.760]   Well, they do now but they didn't sell advertising and they really didn't need ratings.
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:48.360]   What they cared about is churn.
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:49.360]   Right.
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:50.360]   Which is always been HBO's thing.
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:51.360]   That's the word I'm working on.
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:52.360]   Thank you.
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:58.440]   So that kind of is the pushback is there's many corporate minutions that have happened.
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:01.480]   The content on HBO has remained consistently.
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:03.520]   Not for long.
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:04.520]   I don't know.
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:07.800]   I very much worry that David Zazlev is going to...
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:11.680]   I would worry more if Casey Boyce and other people left HBO but if that doesn't happen,
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:18.440]   I actually because I was very worried about John Stanky and we had some even the terrible
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:23.440]   name HBO Max.
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:26.440]   He was.
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:27.440]   Yeah.
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:32.800]   And did really terrible things to a lot of that but HBO Max, terrible name aside, the
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:34.600]   programming even on HBO Max was good.
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:35.600]   Got better.
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:36.600]   Yeah.
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:38.760]   But they merged this now with Discovery, right?
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:39.760]   Has that happened yet?
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:40.760]   It's going to be happening but it's going to be separate.
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:41.840]   Will that change it?
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:42.840]   I don't know.
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:43.840]   We'll see.
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:49.920]   As long as we still have shows like Succession and White Lotus and The Vow and even four
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:53.800]   season things like Westworld, I'm hopeful.
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:55.460]   Hugely expensive programming.
[02:36:55.460 --> 02:36:57.200]   But also pays off.
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:02.040]   The Game of Thrones prequel series broke every single record.
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:03.240]   So it was a success.
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:07.280]   You think HBO will continue down that road?
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:08.280]   I think so.
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:09.280]   I think that that was at least...
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:10.440]   Was Lord of the Rings enough?
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:12.640]   Was the Rings of Power enough for Amazon to keep that?
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:13.640]   I don't think so.
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:14.640]   No.
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:15.640]   I don't think that paid off personally.
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:17.800]   I think that that investment, they paid what, a billion dollars?
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:19.400]   They spent a lot of money.
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:20.400]   Oh my God.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:21.400]   It was ridiculous amount of money.
[02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:22.400]   Quarter of a billion just for the rights.
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:23.400]   Just for the rights, right.
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:25.480]   And then yeah, a huge amount per show.
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:26.480]   Whereas...
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:27.960]   Jeff Bezos wanted that himself.
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:33.600]   I wanted to say as we're moving forward and turning the Gamergate thing into a television
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:36.040]   show, it's so interesting because you're...
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:37.040]   Oh, that's right.
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:38.480]   Now tell me about that by the way.
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:41.760]   Well, we're working like we're producing with Norman Lear's company.
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:42.760]   No kidding.
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:43.760]   Which is...
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:47.200]   Is there a book that it's based on or is it just your memories?
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:50.280]   I shouldn't get into it.
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:51.280]   It's going to be interesting.
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:52.480]   I promise that.
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:53.960]   And you're involved in it though?
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:54.960]   No, 100%.
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:57.280]   I'm actually one of the producers with it.
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:59.360]   It would make a very good...
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:02.160]   Is it going to be a documentary or fiction?
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:05.280]   I mean, the pitch we have right now, it's more fiction.
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:06.280]   Okay.
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:07.280]   So an interesting...
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:09.160]   Kind of like Annandelle V sort of...
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:11.360]   A little bit, a little bit more fact-based.
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:16.120]   But what I was going to say is it's really interesting because my original pitch for
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:22.480]   this that Norman Lear's company was interested in is I wanted to turn it into more of a series,
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:23.480]   right?
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:27.520]   So you just keep going forward in time for however many seasons you can do that.
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:35.640]   It's so much easier now to sell that limited content, like six episode, 10 episode thing.
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:41.080]   And if it does very well, you'll come up with an excuse to bring it back for season two.
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:42.360]   Like, what was that?
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:46.080]   That Watcher Season show on Netflix, which is terrible.
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:47.660]   Don't waste your time on that.
[02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:53.600]   But it's just a trend with rather than moving towards these extremely expensive shows like
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:57.640]   Westworld, something that's smaller in scope, cheaper to produce.
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:03.580]   That's just like everyone involved is telling me that's why we're streaming this going.
[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:09.200]   It's really changed the equation because it isn't ratings driven, it's subscriber driven.
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:10.200]   Right.
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:16.600]   And so apparently Netflix is going to offer this ad supported tier, which is smart because
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:21.640]   then it's only a $5 a month subscription instead of $15 a month and you get ads.
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:27.840]   Although I did see that they are not letting some of their most popular shows on the ad
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:30.800]   like The Crown will not be available on the ad support.
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:33.500]   I wonder if The Crown is because that's a joint production.
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:34.500]   They don't have the choice.
[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:36.400]   They might not have the rights.
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:39.540]   They're also not going to be doing, at least they're not going to be doing ads in the middle
[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:44.520]   of films but some of their creators like Shonda Rhimes, they don't want because they're not
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:47.200]   creating shows to be interrupted.
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:52.360]   Ryan Murphy, who's very smart, I think, and a very good producer creates his shows with
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:53.580]   react structure.
[02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:56.200]   So he's said that he's okay with it.
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:58.480]   I actually think that's been a problem with streaming services.
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:03.480]   HBO again is different here because they've still made shows with a kind of beginning,
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:04.480]   middle, end.
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:10.880]   You go to an era where the amount of runtime could be inconsistent and when you were creating
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:15.480]   shows to be streamed and to binge watch and watch the next episode immediately after,
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:21.520]   I think that that does not play well with ad supported content because it ruins the
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:22.800]   flow.
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:27.640]   And so this is now going, I think a lot of showrunners are going to have to learn what
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:34.320]   the previous seven decades of television producers knew, which was, "Okay, we have to make
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:36.240]   things that can have break points."
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:44.400]   Let's take a little break because we're going to go to Act 18 of this show.
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.840]   It's great to have the Rocket crew on and I hope you listen to their show at Relay.fm.
[02:40:48.840 --> 02:40:53.580]   We've introduced a whole new group of people to something that is really a wonderful show
[02:40:53.580 --> 02:41:01.880]   with Simona Rochefort and Christina Warren and Brianna Wu and we're so glad to have the
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:03.300]   three of you.
[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:05.200]   Coming up, I will get hit by a pie.
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:08.620]   So I know you're all going to want to stay tuned for that.
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:13.300]   Our show today brought to you by Podium.
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:17.200]   It's pretty clear among the others, and what we talk about on all of our shows is how technology
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:19.860]   is changing our world very dramatically.
[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:25.760]   Sometimes it happens and you don't notice it and then you suddenly wake up and for instance,
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:27.440]   who makes phone calls anymore?
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:28.560]   We text.
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:35.520]   We text and more and more businesses are realizing this is the way to interact with our customers.
[02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:36.520]   Customers prefer this.
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:40.400]   Maybe COVID taught us a little bit when you would make a place an order and then they
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:42.040]   would text you, "Your order is ready."
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:45.320]   And then I'd say, "I'm on my way," and pick it up on the curb.
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:48.320]   And we just got easier and easier and easier.
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:52.120]   If you own a small business, you really need to look at Podium.
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:57.560]   It is a way to keep ahead of the curve by using the tools your customers want you to
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:41:59.320]   use, modern messaging tools.
[02:41:59.320 --> 02:42:02.740]   So it's easier for customers to connect with your business.
[02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:06.920]   It's easier for you to connect with your customers.
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:12.720]   I will tell you as a customer, I don't want to call a business, whether it's a plumber,
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:15.120]   a landscaper, a restaurant, a dentist.
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:16.440]   I hate playing phone tag.
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:17.840]   I hate leaving messages.
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:20.640]   I'm never available to talk on the phone.
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:23.240]   I'm always available for a text message.
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:28.080]   So if you're a business that communicates with me via text message, you're going to
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:30.100]   get my business.
[02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:33.000]   If you're running a business today and the only way to get in touch with you is a phone
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.620]   number, I guarantee you, you're losing customers.
[02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:41.680]   Customers who get that answering machine, get that service and go, "Yeah, no, never
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:42.680]   mind.
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:43.680]   I hang up."
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:48.480]   Podium gives businesses the tools to compete with the convenience already offered by, "Amazon's
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:49.800]   already doing this.
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:51.740]   The big businesses are doing this."
[02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:58.560]   Now as a retail business in a small town like ours, you can make such a huge difference.
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:02.400]   I know that many of the people I do business with now are using Podium.
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:06.920]   My dentist, when I'm leaving, they say, "Your next appointment," and they give me the date
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:08.280]   in a way that I can click it.
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:11.120]   It goes to my calendar and then this is so smart.
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:13.800]   Leave us a review on Yelp or Google or whatever.
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:14.800]   I click it.
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:16.760]   I leave the five stars.
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:17.760]   It's fast.
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:18.760]   It's easy.
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:19.760]   It really works.
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:21.480]   But it isn't just reviews.
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:24.200]   It's not just information.
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:28.520]   One car dealer actually, in fact, I think this happens all the time, sold a $50,000
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:30.200]   truck and four text messages.
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.400]   You see this all the time now where a dealer will text somebody, "Hey, I just got the new
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:37.480]   Mustang Mach-E in stock.
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:38.680]   Are you interested?"
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:39.680]   It works.
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:46.440]   A jeweler sold a $5,000 ring coordinated curbside pickup all through text, not once
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:47.440]   on the phone.
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:51.720]   A dentist sent out payment requests through text, got 70% of their outstanding collections
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:52.880]   in just two weeks.
[02:43:52.880 --> 02:43:56.640]   Yeah, you can actually get payments through Podium.
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:00.720]   Your employees will like it because instead of a variety of different ways to communicate,
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:01.720]   you got one inbox.
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:05.280]   Everything goes into it from your website, from text messaging.
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:06.280]   You can do more than chat.
[02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:07.720]   You can get those online reviews.
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:08.720]   You can collect payments.
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:12.240]   You can send marketing campaigns that get a response.
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:13.240]   It's so easy.
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:14.240]   It's so fast.
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:17.080]   Your customers want you to communicate with them that way.
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:19.440]   See how Podium can grow your business.
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:30.240]   You can see a demo today right now at podium.com/twit, podium.com/twit and give it a shot.
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:35.240]   I think you will see this will change the way you do business, change the way you interact
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:36.240]   with your customers.
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:39.620]   Over 100,000 local businesses now use Podium.
[02:44:39.620 --> 02:44:40.620]   You should too.
[02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:43.620]   Podium, podium.com/twit.
[02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:46.960]   Podium, let's grow.
[02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:50.000]   All right, I got to open this.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.440]   I can't put this off any longer.
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:53.440]   This is so cool.
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:58.680]   All right, before I do, we got a little video that we made that shows you some of the things
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:00.360]   that happened this week on Twitter.
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:01.360]   I think you're going to enjoy it.
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:02.360]   Watch.
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:06.920]   All right, bring in the cute.
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:08.760]   Where's the cute?
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:09.760]   Where is the cute?
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:10.760]   There's the cute.
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:13.760]   Oh my goodness, that dog is so cute.
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:16.760]   Previously on Podium.com, we've been talking about the dog.
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:20.240]   On twit, MacBreak Weekly.
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:24.280]   Everybody's trying to figure out how to survive and Apple's decided that putting more gambling
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:28.720]   ads in the app store is really the way to make.
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:31.440]   That went really bad, really fast.
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.400]   Mark Armant's tweet, "Now my app's product page shows gambling ads, which I'm really
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:36.400]   not okay with.
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:40.480]   The app store has corrupted such a great company so deeply.
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:45.520]   They make so much from gambling and the manipulative in-app purchases, they don't even see the problem
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:46.520]   anymore."
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:47.520]   Photography.
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:52.680]   Yeah, I've been looking around at some old photographs, and apparently a lot of you too
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:56.720]   out there in the hands-on photography community, been looking at some old photographs and been
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:45:58.440]   wanting to restore them.
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:01.920]   Well, that's what we're going to get into this week, doing some photo restorations.
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:06.480]   I have some tips and tricks and some options for you, and it's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:07.640]   The tech guy.
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:12.040]   We've got Micah suited up now in the other studios in the big room because you need a
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:13.040]   lot of room.
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:15.600]   We're going to try out this new Quest Pro.
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:20.640]   This is the $1,600 virtual reality visor that Meta sells.
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:21.640]   There you go.
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:22.640]   See if you can get that in the chimney.
[02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:26.200]   This is a Oculus Quest for Jimmy.
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:27.200]   Tweet.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.720]   It's not, you know, my favorite podcasts are not quirky podcasts.
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:33.600]   They're security podcasts.
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:35.240]   There we go.
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:37.560]   Got the security guard.
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:42.600]   That's Lily, our new office security guard.
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:43.600]   She smells really good.
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:44.600]   She's so cute.
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:45.600]   She's a sweetie.
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:50.600]   She doesn't taste really good though.
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:54.040]   How's the breath?
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:57.840]   Does Christina get to pet Lily?
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:46:59.560]   Lily's not here right now.
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:00.560]   I'm sorry.
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:01.560]   It's okay.
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:02.560]   That's okay.
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:03.560]   She's a toy poodle, a teacup.
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:04.560]   She's so cute.
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:05.560]   She's really tiny.
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:06.560]   Oh my God.
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:07.560]   I want her.
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:08.560]   We got her a little vest that says security.
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:09.560]   I saw that.
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:10.560]   I was like, oh, she's your security guard dog.
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:11.560]   I love it.
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:12.560]   She's in charge.
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:13.560]   Yeah.
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:14.560]   I love it.
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:15.560]   I love it.
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:16.560]   How big did they get?
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:17.560]   That's it.
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:18.560]   That's it?
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:19.560]   I think so.
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:20.560]   Yeah.
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:21.560]   Oh, okay.
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:22.560]   That's the dog I want.
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:23.560]   It's a teacup.
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:24.560]   No, okay.
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:25.560]   But I didn't realize.
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:26.560]   Okay.
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:27.560]   Because she doesn't, she's not a yappy.
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:28.560]   Sometimes small dogs can be yappy.
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:29.560]   I don't know.
[02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:30.560]   She might be.
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:33.360]   She's still a puppy, but apparently she's not going to get much bigger and she's very
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:35.100]   quiet and calm.
[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:36.100]   Amazing.
[02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:37.960]   So tell me about your event this week.
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:38.960]   All right.
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:42.700]   So GitHub universe is taking place on Wednesday and Thursday and it's kind of a celebration
[02:47:42.700 --> 02:47:46.440]   of all the development things happening on GitHub and in the open source system.
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:49.200]   By the way, and this is unsolicited, I love GitHub.
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:54.420]   I was very nervous like a lot of us that when Microsoft bought it, it would somehow become
[02:47:54.420 --> 02:47:55.420]   a corporate.
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:47:56.420]   Same.
[02:47:56.420 --> 02:47:57.420]   Yeah.
[02:47:57.420 --> 02:48:00.360]   And I know people left for GitLab and their own Git instance.
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:02.600]   I never left and I'm using it more than ever.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:06.840]   I have a paid account now again and I use it for my blog.
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:08.720]   It backs up my Hugo blog.
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:14.120]   I have 30 repositories because I do a lot of fun stuff.
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:15.120]   It's great.
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:16.120]   I love it.
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:17.120]   I'm very happy with it.
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:19.360]   I have public repositories and I have private stuff.
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:20.960]   All my dot files are on there.
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:21.960]   I love GitHub.
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:23.280]   So thank you.
[02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:27.080]   And Martin, your colleague is here from Northern Ireland.
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:28.240]   He came out for this event.
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:29.240]   He came out for this event.
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:31.240]   Yeah, because he's a big deal.
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:32.240]   He's a big deal?
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:33.240]   Yeah.
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:34.240]   He said he's your driver.
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:35.240]   He is.
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:37.200]   Well, I mean, that's what...
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:38.200]   No.
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:39.200]   He's your boss too?
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:40.200]   He's my boss too.
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:41.200]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:42.200]   No, no.
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:43.200]   That's great.
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:44.200]   He's also the vice president of developer relations.
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:45.200]   He's fantastic.
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:46.200]   If you want the beef jerky, you can have it.
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:47.200]   I'm sorry.
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:49.200]   I didn't mean to slap your hand.
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:51.200]   No, he loves this.
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:52.200]   No, but...
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:53.560]   And actually, he was the one who...
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:55.360]   This was his idea to make these badges.
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:56.360]   So these are...
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:48:58.640]   We're giving them to people who attend the event.
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:48:59.640]   Some of our...
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:00.920]   We're kind of doing a beta test.
[02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:02.640]   Can you get the over the shoulder Benito?
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:03.640]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:06.560]   These are for some of our GitHub stars and some community members.
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:08.440]   GitHub Badger 2040.
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:09.440]   So this is from the future.
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:10.440]   Yeah.
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:11.440]   So this is...
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:12.440]   You'll see.
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:13.440]   It is...
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:14.440]   Okay.
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:15.440]   There's a floppy disk.
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:16.440]   No, that's...
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:17.440]   Open it.
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:18.440]   Okay.
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:20.240]   That's definitely a floppy disk.
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:21.240]   No, that's the badge.
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:22.240]   It's a zip disk?
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:23.240]   No.
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:24.240]   It's in the bubble wrap?
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:25.240]   Yep.
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:26.240]   Oh, and I got a nice GitHub lanyard.
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:28.200]   I'm going to wear this everywhere.
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:29.200]   This is awesome.
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:30.200]   So this is programmable.
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:32.360]   This has a Raspberry Pi 2040 in it.
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:33.360]   Oh, you're kidding.
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:34.360]   No.
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:35.360]   You can't even get those anymore.
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:36.360]   Oh, wow.
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:37.360]   It's a USB port.
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:38.360]   Oh, look at that.
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:39.360]   And it's E Ink.
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:40.360]   So when you turn this on...
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:41.360]   No.
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:42.360]   Yeah.
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:43.360]   So...
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:44.360]   Oh my God.
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:45.360]   Is there a battery?
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:46.360]   Yeah, there's a battery.
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:47.360]   And there's a...
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:48.360]   Here's a battery.
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:49.360]   Here's a battery.
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:50.360]   Here's two AAAs.
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:55.680]   I just found out I can buy 300 AAAs for 30 bucks from Amazon.
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:56.680]   So...
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:49:57.680]   Amazing.
[02:49:57.680 --> 02:49:58.680]   I'll be set to run this forever.
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:49:59.680]   I can do it.
[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:00.680]   Okay.
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:01.680]   Okay.
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:02.680]   Yeah.
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:04.240]   I was going to say my nails, unfortunately, are non-existent.
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:07.200]   And I also got a manicure for GitHub universe and...
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:09.120]   You've been playing too much of that link game.
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:10.120]   That's exactly it.
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:11.120]   No, I've been biting my nails actually.
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:12.120]   But no, so what's great about this...
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:13.120]   Are you nervous?
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:14.120]   No, I just...
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:15.120]   Well, I mean, naturally.
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:16.120]   Yeah.
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:17.120]   So, okay.
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:18.120]   So...
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:19.120]   I used to bite my nails when I was a kid.
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:20.120]   So this is also programmable.
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:21.120]   Yeah.
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:22.120]   So it has a USB port.
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:23.120]   Okay.
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:24.120]   So this plugs in.
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:25.120]   Yeah.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:26.120]   The battery's in here.
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:27.120]   I'm going to plug this in.
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:28.120]   Yep.
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:29.120]   It's got an E Ink screen.
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:30.120]   Yep.
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:31.120]   So the idea is your visitors would wear this...
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:32.120]   So what you do, you program it.
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:33.120]   ...to get into the show.
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:34.120]   You program it.
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:35.120]   You can program it.
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:36.120]   Yep.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:37.120]   Oh, it's for coders, isn't it?
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:38.120]   Yeah.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.120]   But it's also got some easy...
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:41.600]   We've got some fairly easy things that people can do...
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:44.200]   Coders probably know which way to stick this in.
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:46.440]   I certainly am not having any luck.
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:47.640]   Christina, it's so funny.
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:49.600]   She really wants to hold that hand.
[02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:50.600]   She wants to help so badly.
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:51.600]   She wants...
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:52.600]   It's so cute.
[02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:53.600]   She's like...
[02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:54.600]   Her little hands are coming in.
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:55.600]   I can do it.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:56.600]   I really can.
[02:50:56.600 --> 02:50:57.600]   But Leah, go ahead.
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:50:58.600]   You want to try that?
[02:50:58.600 --> 02:50:59.600]   I put the battery in for you.
[02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:00.600]   It's teamwork.
[02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:01.600]   Makes the dream work.
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:02.600]   Yeah.
[02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:03.600]   That's exactly it.
[02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:06.520]   So this is for charging up something or...
[02:51:06.520 --> 02:51:10.640]   I can't obviously use the USB cable while I'm walking around the show.
[02:51:10.640 --> 02:51:12.280]   Oh, you got nice soft ones.
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:13.280]   That's good.
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:14.280]   I like that cable.
[02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:15.280]   Oh my God.
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:16.280]   It has my name on it.
[02:51:16.280 --> 02:51:17.280]   Yeah.
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:18.280]   Oh my God.
[02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:19.280]   Oh my God.
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:20.280]   A QR code.
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:21.280]   Yep.
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:22.280]   Oh, that is so cool.
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:23.280]   Wait, that is sick.
[02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:25.480]   And Martin, what buttons does he need to press to...
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:27.360]   I think the power just went out, actually.
[02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:28.360]   No, it's just because...
[02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:30.240]   Oh, it's E Ink.
[02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:31.760]   So it doesn't matter if the power went out.
[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:32.760]   It's going to stay there.
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:33.760]   Wait, can I scan the QR code?
[02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:34.760]   Hang on.
[02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:35.760]   Yeah.
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:36.760]   What are you going to get if you...
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:37.760]   No, I think...
[02:51:37.760 --> 02:51:38.760]   Oh, the power went out.
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:39.760]   Oh, there it is.
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:40.760]   It just came back.
[02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:41.760]   You know, it's probably...
[02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:42.760]   Oh, I might not have gotten it in all the way.
[02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:43.760]   Loose connection maybe.
[02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:45.760]   The QR code links to your profile on GitHub.
[02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:47.640]   It links to my GitHub profile.
[02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:48.640]   Leo Laporte.
[02:51:48.640 --> 02:51:49.640]   Wow.
[02:51:49.640 --> 02:51:51.680]   GitHub.com/LeoLaporte.
[02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:53.760]   You can see my Emacs configuration.
[02:51:53.760 --> 02:51:54.760]   Yeah.
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:51:55.760]   And now, so when you...
[02:51:55.760 --> 02:51:56.760]   I did it!
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:51:57.760]   Oh my God.
[02:51:57.760 --> 02:51:58.760]   It's so cool.
[02:51:58.760 --> 02:51:59.760]   I better get to work.
[02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:00.760]   I only have 22 contributions.
[02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:01.760]   I scanned it.
[02:52:01.760 --> 02:52:02.760]   I scanned it.
[02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:03.760]   I brought it to the profile.
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:04.760]   That's awesome.
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:05.760]   You're fast.
[02:52:05.760 --> 02:52:06.760]   You're fast.
[02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:09.760]   That is really, really neat.
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:10.760]   I'm going to have to get more stars though.
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:11.760]   That is 10 out of 10.
[02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:12.760]   I'm embarrassed.
[02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:14.760]   Wow, Martin, what a great idea.
[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:16.760]   GitHub universe 2022.
[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:18.760]   Now, not everybody gets this.
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:20.760]   You have to be special.
[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:24.760]   But we're hoping that we'll get feedback from people and then maybe we can start to do this
[02:52:24.760 --> 02:52:27.760]   at more of our events because I think it's really cool.
[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:29.760]   This is Martin's brainchild.
[02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:30.760]   And Martin actually programmed these.
[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:31.760]   I have to say.
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:32.760]   All of them?
[02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:33.760]   Yeah.
[02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:34.760]   By hand?
[02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:35.760]   Yeah.
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:36.760]   Yeah.
[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:39.760]   One by one, inch by inch, slowly I turn.
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:43.760]   Well, make sure that no pie gets on this when I get hit in the face.
[02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:45.760]   That is so cool.
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:47.760]   Can I reprogram it?
[02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:48.760]   It's Python.
[02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:49.760]   It's Python.
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:50.760]   Okay.
[02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:51.760]   Very nice.
[02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:52.760]   How do I...
[02:52:52.760 --> 02:52:53.760]   Where do I interface with?
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:54.760]   Oh, there's a little...
[02:52:54.760 --> 02:52:55.760]   Yeah, there's a USB-C.
[02:52:55.760 --> 02:52:56.760]   USB-C.
[02:52:56.760 --> 02:52:57.760]   So you can just kind of plug it in.
[02:52:57.760 --> 02:52:58.760]   That's what the cable's for.
[02:52:58.760 --> 02:52:59.760]   Yep.
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:02.760]   Boot, reset.
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:03.760]   Wow.
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:05.760]   I want to...
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:06.760]   Oh, God.
[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:07.760]   That's GitHub Universe.

[02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:10.760]   Only part of it's in person, right?
[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:11.760]   You can do it online.
[02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:12.760]   You know it's hybrid, so all this stuff is going to be online.
