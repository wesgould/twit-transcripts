[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.840]   and a great panel assembled on this September 11, 2011,
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.920]   starting with Liz Gaines from allthingsd.com.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.520]   Nice to see you Liz.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.040]   I know Liz is dad.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.480]   That's how old I'm getting in the business.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.040]   Stu Gaines, good friend, old friend, and really nice.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.520]   You know, I didn't realize you were related.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.040]   You had the same last name.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.840]   And I saw you at FoodCamp.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.800]   You said, no, he's my dad.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.640]   And I went, wow.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.840]   And you know, kind of coincidence,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.920]   because I'm Ben Parr's dad.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.840]   Daddy?
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.680]   Daddy?
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.000]   I am your son.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.360]   Don't know, that's wrong.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.400]   Ben Parr from Mashable, great to have you.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.200]   I'm glad to be on.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.360]   It's good to have you in studio.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.000]   It makes it such a big difference to be
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   able to sit right next to you.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.440]   I love that.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.200]   Of course, Brian Brushwood's also with us.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.440]   We're trying to convince Brian.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.640]   We got his wife to come up here.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.320]   And that was a good, sneaky, giant dude.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.120]   He tries to seduce her to the dark side of her.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.280]   Trying to get her up here and get you with her up here,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.040]   because it's so nice to have you in studio.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.800]   Well, for what else word?
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.640]   She loved Petaluma.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.000]   Good.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.560]   Did that count for you?
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.760]   And you're up doing scam school?
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.120]   Is that what?
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.360]   Yeah, shooting scam school tomorrow.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.800]   In fact, if you guys want to come out on Monday and, yeah,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.160]   doing scam school, it also did--
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.640]   Come where?
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   Where?
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.240]   Some bar.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.600]   Somewhere in Oakland, check the Twitter feed at Shwood.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.560]   So you'll join us.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.640]   You'll tweet it.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.520]   You'll tweet it.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.120]   And so Brian is with NSFW2 on our network as well as scam school.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.520]   Yeah, dude.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.400]   We're on the front page of iTunes right now with a live dragon
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.120]   con show that we did.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.840]   That's fantastic.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.240]   That was an amazing show.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.560]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.320]   If you ever wanted to see a dance off between Link
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.120]   and the Red Skull, this is your one time to finally get to see it.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.080]   And if you don't know what that is,
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.040]   you should start watching NSFW a lot more,
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.600]   because those kind of social commentaries show up a lot.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.640]   You need to know-- you need to get with the memes.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.120]   Yes.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.920]   Get with the memes.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.600]   Also here, Nick Bilton, who is a meme all of his own
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.840]   from the New York Times.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.600]   Good to see you, Nick.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.640]   Relocated from New York.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.320]   Were you in New York during 9/11?
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.840]   I was there.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   20 blocks north of--
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.120]   I actually watched the whole thing happen.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.080]   Does this strike you?
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.640]   It seems to me that people who live on the east
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.680]   because have a very different kind of feeling about 9/11
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.960]   than we on the west.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.080]   It was pretty insane.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.560]   I actually--
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.920]   I was reading a lot of books about Afghanistan at the time.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.040]   And so I knew a lot about it.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   I've been lauding on everything.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.200]   And so when it happened, I kind of
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.640]   had an idea that that was what was going on.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.560]   And I was--
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.880]   I'd actually just moved back to the city that day.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.320]   I was in Jersey for the summer, like living in a beach house.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.360]   It was post bubble.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.880]   So went and--
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.280]   Were you a student at the time?
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.640]   No, I was--
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.040]   I was--
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.880]   worked for some dot coms and made a little bit of money.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.920]   And then wasted it all away, skydiving and traveling.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.080]   But you were one of them?
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.160]   I was one of those guys.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.320]   You were a bubble boy.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.760]   I was a bubble boy.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.160]   Well, I wasn't like a big bubble boy.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.280]   I was a little bubble boy.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.040]   That's cool.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.560]   That's great.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.520]   I honor you for that.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.280]   I was a bubble babe.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.480]   And so I came back to the city on September 10th.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.720]   And actually, my girlfriend at the time
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.800]   and I had made plans to meet at Windows on the world
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.000]   on September 11th at 7 o'clock.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.920]   Oh my god.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.560]   And that morning woke up.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.280]   And I used to skydive a lot back then.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.880]   And so I remember looking up at the sky
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.760]   and being like, wow, today would be a great day to go skydiving
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.680]   because it was like--
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.600]   Percrystal, very clear.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   Very clear and blue.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.920]   And then watched the planes hit.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.880]   And then watched the--
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.920]   So you saw it all happen live live.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.760]   Wow.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   Now, how quick do you realize that that's not an accident
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.240]   when you're actually there?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.080]   Instantly, just because I know a lot about planes
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.640]   and I'd been reading about Bin Laden
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.600]   and all this stuff was going on.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.520]   So you probably more than any quicker than anybody
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.320]   realized it was a terrorist?
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.000]   Well, the two days earlier, there
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.280]   was a guy in Afghanistan who used to fight the Taliban
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.160]   and he'd been killed two days earlier by Bin Laden.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.360]   There was a lot of stuff online back then.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.480]   It was a different story.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.800]   But there was a lot of discussions about what
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.160]   was going to happen.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.560]   And so I knew pretty quickly that what was going on.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.240]   You knew better, though, than a lot of the news
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.360]   because I think a lot of the news--
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.520]   Well, a lot of the news I remember watching
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   an accident at the next--
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.160]   The talking heads like, oh, well, the aviation equipment
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.760]   must have been wrong.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.040]   The aviation equipment is not wrong.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040]   Not that wrong.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.040]   Not that wrong.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.120]   Because we were talking about before they had a couple planes.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.200]   It had these crash lines.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.040]   And even one of those small planes
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.560]   had hit, like, well, it trades on maybe in the last year
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.840]   before.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.360]   So people were wondering, is that what's going on?
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.560]   Is this just another accident?
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.640]   Then the second plane hit, then everybody knew.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.440]   Yeah, it was pretty insane to watch it all unfold.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.760]   You know, there's so much, of course,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.840]   every network's doing their 911 remembrance
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   and all that stuff.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.000]   So we don't necessarily need to go great into it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.360]   But there are some attack angles.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.200]   YouTube has a 911 channel, which I think is quite good.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.320]   This is one way to experience 911.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.720]   And I think there's a whole generation of kids who either
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.760]   dimly remember it or don't remember it.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.600]   And for them, this is a great archive.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.120]   And that's one thing we have to remember
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.560]   is that as media progresses, this stuff goes hyper-recorded.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.280]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.480]   This is pre-YouTube, pre-Twitter, pre-Facebook.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.440]   And yet we have a lot of video.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.720]   The thing that I think is fascinating is, yeah,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.560]   this was pre-smartphone.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.040]   Right.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.080]   But imagine if it happened today.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.960]   It would be a very different--
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.200]   It would be a very, very different media experience.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.640]   Archive.org, which is Brewster Cale's really wonderful group.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.320]   They're archiving the entire internet.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.640]   But they also have a television news archive
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.760]   that they made with NYU called Understanding 911.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.720]   Oh, really?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.280]   That is different than the YouTube.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.640]   It's a little more scholarly, frankly.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.040]   There's a lot of different information here.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.000]   It seemed like YouTube was trying to tell the stories.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.560]   You got a lot of almost documentary-style footage
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.120]   of people telling their experience.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   It was very moving.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.680]   I poked around on that last night.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.520]   Whereas as the internet archive tends to do,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.720]   they're looking to just preserve the facts of what happened.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.240]   Right.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.720]   And there's a lot of it.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.960]   But as you say, Nick, it would be so different today.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.440]   God willing, we won't have something like that happen again.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.080]   But history tells us anything.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.200]   We know there will be some other thing like this
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.240]   that we will be recording, whether it's a tsunami,
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.840]   an earthquake, or a terrorist attack.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.600]   And it will be so different.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.800]   And the one thing I do remember--
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.520]   I retweeted Jim, the editor of the NYTimes.com earlier,
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.000]   who showed the front page of the New York Times that day.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.840]   And I remember that was one of the first times
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.720]   that I actually used the web for breaking news.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.880]   And I mean, everything went down.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.720]   The Times, they have to pull the logo off the website
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.600]   because it was just-- couldn't handle the traffic.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.480]   And this was also one of the first stories
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.720]   where we figured out that voice communications over cell phones
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.240]   were unliable.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.760]   Not reliable.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   Because the actors, not reliable.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.400]   But the texts would actually go through.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   Harry McCracken wrote a good article today on the Technologizer,
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.640]   not only his memories-- and by the way,
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.840]   Jeff Jarvis also on his buzzmachine.com, really great post.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.680]   But on technologies that have changed--
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.000]   we mentioned Facebook and YouTube,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.560]   but we didn't have 3G wireless.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.520]   The iPod was released the next month.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.080]   Windows XP was later.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.120]   XP was later.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.360]   Xbox was later.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.480]   Xbox 360, Xbox.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.560]   WordPress, Skype, ThinkPads, Firefox, Gmail.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.640]   I mean, 10 years is a long time in technology.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.200]   I think you pick any event 10 years ago.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.800]   You'd have the same kind of list.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.280]   But still, it's something to remember
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.080]   that we're in a very different world.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.880]   His list of-- and you liked this one, Ben.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.000]   I know-- of top 10 sites August 2001,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.160]   compared to top 10 sites this year.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.760]   Yeah, you look in the past.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   That was what GeoCities--
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.120]   Number one was MSN.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.960]   Which is--
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.400]   Number two was Yahoo.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.120]   The more amazed by Neopets.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.840]   I know Neopets was that popular?
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.280]   It's funny.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.000]   Oh, well, my daughter, who let's see 10 years ago, was nine.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.360]   Wow.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.440]   It was a huge Neopets.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.640]   We were just talking about that.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.440]   My daughter had 20 accounts.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   I asked her-- I remember her at the time.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.320]   I said, honey, now you know that some of the people on Neopets--
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.520]   Neopets was like a virtual pet site.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.720]   And she had a side bunny and a bunch of other things
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.200]   like that.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.480]   And I said, now, honey, you understand
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.520]   that some of these people on the site are not kids
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.440]   playing with virtual pets, but adults praying on kids.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.120]   Because remember, we thought this was a big thing.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.880]   And she said, oh, don't worry, dad,
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.240]   because in my profile, I say I'm a 32-year-old guy
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.800]   from New Jersey who drives a Camaro.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.520]   No way.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.920]   That's awesome.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.280]   That's when I stopped worrying about my daughter.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.440]   Go to.com.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.520]   I don't even remember what that was.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.440]   Go to-- that was ABC's venture.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.000]   Really?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.920]   AOL, go.com.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.760]   The ghostal-- that's still ABC.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.840]   Yeah, ghostal pop-ex--
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.120]   Oh, no, go to is different?
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.400]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.240]   Because ghostal around because ESPN.go.com is still
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.800]   what happens when you do it.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.160]   Right, which is so stupid.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:00.600]   Agreed.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.240]   Excuse me.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.200]   Your ABC, your ESPN.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.560]   Have a site for Christ's sake.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.720]   Go.com, passports.com.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.600]   Is that--
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.880]   What was Passport?
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.440]   Oh, maybe.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.640]   Must have been their single sign.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.840]   Excite?
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.480]   Oh, I remember.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.440]   Oh, I remember.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.080]   Then Joe Krausk found aliens and left.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.920]   In Geosities.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.440]   Geosities.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.840]   Now, of course, Google, Facebook, Yahoo, YouTube, Bing,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.040]   Wikipedia, MSN is still in the top 10, the only one.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.360]   And Yahoo, yep, Bing.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.120]   Yahoo, Facebook.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.040]   Face what?
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.080]   Fact Yahoo is the only one that hasn't changed much.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.840]   That's interesting.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.000]   Well, Yahoo's changed.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.160]   Maybe not its rankings, but everything else has changed.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.360]   But that just shows you that Yahoo's somehow
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.680]   still a valuable company.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.240]   Go.com.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   What happened to excite.com?
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:46.720]   Is it still there?
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.360]   Who owns it?
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.920]   I just went to Neopets.com.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.400]   I feel like it's like--
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.840]   I feel like it's put through a time machine right there.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.960]   Neopets is still there?
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.400]   Yeah, this is a games or something.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.240]   Yeah, it's a kids game.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.160]   Did you play Neopets?
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.360]   Liz, you were about that age.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.160]   Oh, yeah, right.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.400]   Yeah, it's like it's a gaming set.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.760]   It's no longer about virtual pets so much, I guess.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.560]   Isn't it the one where you buy the physical one
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.920]   and play virtually?
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.280]   No, that is.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.720]   What is that?
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.880]   That's the get the stuffed animal,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.840]   and then you get the website.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   That wasn't the webkins.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.720]   Do you know about the webkins?
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   Webkins.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.640]   I know I'd buy some of the webkins.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.440]   Somebody has a child here.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.640]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.520]   I tip my hand.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.040]   It was all about webkins.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.240]   Well, Neopets was the webkins of the--
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.360]   So do you want to know a little New York Times fact?
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.520]   So the headline for US "Attack" the day after 9/11
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.280]   was one of the biggest--
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.160]   the typography size is a big deal with the history of the paper.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.440]   How big that headline was.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.520]   The headlines are.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.640]   But the biggest headline ever--
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.840]   let's see if you can guess what it was, what news event.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.160]   The biggest one that Times has ever
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.800]   run across the top of the--
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.760]   On the front, when they walked on the moon.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.720]   Coolidge wins.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.560]   World War II.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.440]   What era?
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.720]   What decade?
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.320]   It was actually the last decade.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:52.840]   Oh.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.800]   Gaga is awesome.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.960]   Lady Gaga was pregnant.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.600]   That was it.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   What?
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.360]   It was 1, 1, 0, 0.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.040]   It was the millennium.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   Oh.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.840]   Oh.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.000]   They had time to set that one up.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.480]   But US attacked, I believe, is like the second or third.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.640]   The largest they've ever run across the headline.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.840]   Did anyone else-- do you remember that weird phase
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.400]   after 9/11 when nobody wanted to--
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.680]   You just Google image search it?
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.160]   You'll see it.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.660]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.320]   I'd like to find that headline.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.480]   So if I image search, US attacked, I could find it.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.800]   US attacked MY Times and then images,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.680]   they actually-- they're right next to each other.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.200]   Let's see.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.320]   Let's see that headline.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.160]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.240]   And there's men walked on the moon.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.800]   And there's 1, 1, 0, 0.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.960]   There you go.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.460]   And there's--
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.200]   This was pretty big.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.800]   Yeah, that was pretty big.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.400]   But different sized paperback, then.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.800]   It was like this big.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   And read it.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.240]   But then the New York Post had something like what--
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.680]   some profanity, like, damn you.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.760]   What did the Post have?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.240]   I can't remember.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.280]   I'm trying to remember the--
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.600]   Question.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.880]   We could probably find that thanks to Google.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.840]   New York Post 9/11.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.360]   I like doing my research live.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.600]   Did you imagine how much fun it'd be to be a New York Post
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.520]   headline writer?
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.800]   What I was going to say is there's--
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.000]   everything is obviously very somber right afterwards.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.960]   But I remember this breath of fresh air.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.080]   I think it was two weeks.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.960]   They took a week off when the onion came back.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.440]   Oh, really?
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.280]   And they were the first to really--
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.840]   I don't know, release the tension
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.480]   by putting their satirical take on it.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.760]   It was OK because they did it so well.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.800]   And it was very soon, though.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.920]   I mean, it was two weeks afterwards.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.240]   Yeah, they took a week off.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.040]   And then there was--
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.240]   they had a press conference given by God asking,
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.040]   which of these 10 commandments do you not understand?
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.200]   That boy safe after WTC attack.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.880]   US vows to defend whoever it is, to defeat whoever
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.400]   it is we're at war with.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.640]   Highjacker's surprise to find selves in hell.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.600]   That was one where it was funny, but it also, at the same time,
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.520]   kind of felt good.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.800]   It was like, OK, good.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.320]   This is one way to make a joke about it that is OK, I guess.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.560]   And it took quite a while.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.320]   I remember "Daily Show" was several months
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.200]   until they got back on.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.480]   I remember, like, I watched that YouTube maybe less than a week
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.720]   ago, like, when John Stewart was back on.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.000]   It's like, it's a little bit gut-wrenching.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.600]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.560]   All right, well, that's our tribute to 9-1-1.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.680]   And let's not, of course, forget the people who
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.600]   lost their lives in the attacks and also
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.080]   the amazing New York City Fire Department, police department,
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.200]   who really leapt into action, many of whom
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.680]   also lost their lives in the collapse of the buildings.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:42.400]   NBC's Twitter account was hacked by Scriptkitties this week.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.600]   Scriptkitties.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   Maybe, right?
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.680]   The person who hacked it claimed responsibility, maybe not
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.320]   using the person who hacked it's Twitter.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.640]   Oh, how interesting.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.400]   Well, I never know.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.560]   So here's the four relevant tweets.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.680]   NBC-- first of all, notice their logo changed a little bit.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.160]   Breaking news, "Ground Zero" has just been attacked.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.880]   That's horrible, frankly.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.160]   That kind of sick.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.120]   Sick.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.680]   And then another one with the NBC News logo restored.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.640]   And then this is not a joke.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.920]   And then finally, NBC News hacked by the Scriptkitties,
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.120]   followed them at S on their scorekitties, which
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.720]   is fairly stupid because--
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.160]   What did they expect to have happen?
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.680]   They were the old Twitter's like, oh, that's fine.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.880]   Just keep that account.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.760]   Enjoy those followers.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.680]   I imagine the subpoenas flew fast and furious.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.760]   You crazy kids.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.440]   Yeah, the FBI is doing the best on the answer.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   Immediately.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.000]   And of course, all the FBI has to do
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.960]   is subpoena Twitter and they'll release that information.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.000]   I mean, I get wanting to hack NBC or whatever, the man.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.640]   But why the hell would you want to say that?
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.280]   I mean, I don't understand what--
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.640]   But I think this is what we kind of are starting
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.440]   to realize about Lull's sec, and anonymous,
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.520]   and now the Komodo hacker, which is just this guy's--
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.640]   his manifesto is twisted and perverted and bizarre--
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.440]   is that these people are-- can maybe not exactly normal.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.560]   Yes.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.360]   There's something going on more than--
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.040]   I mean, obviously, they have mad skills.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.360]   Well, I don't even know if that's the case,
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.320]   because a lot of security experts
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.880]   said that the guy's behind Lull's sec.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.720]   They only person that really knew what he was doing
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.000]   was Sabu, the guy that ran it.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.320]   Everyone else would essentially--
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.000]   Do you think that this guy that they arrested--
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.640]   He's topiary?
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.280]   He's topiary?
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.280]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.520]   He's the kid they arrested in Britain.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.960]   He's the kid that they arrested in the north of England.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.880]   And actually, a very creative writer, very funny.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.120]   Which topiary was?
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.920]   Which you very, very-- yeah, but just got him
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.960]   with the wrong group of kids.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.800]   And maybe not a hacker himself, just
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.000]   their communications czar.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.480]   Correct.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.760]   Yeah, he doesn't know much about it.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.680]   But we don't know if Sabu has been--
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.280]   Sabu's still tweeting away, and he's there.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:48.840]   He's there.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.040]   He's still doing his thing.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.800]   So as far as we know.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.320]   But I wrote a story about who they were a few months ago,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.680]   and Sabu was really smart about hiding his tracks many,
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.320]   many years ago before he actually even got into this stuff.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.480]   There is a wide range of skill among hackers.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.520]   And there are-- well, the script kitties,
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.320]   of course, at the lowest level, they're people who don't really
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.160]   even know what they're doing.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.360]   They're using scripting tools that
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.800]   are created by more sophisticated hackers.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.240]   And there's a lot of that going on, obviously.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.320]   But then there are people who are very skilled.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.840]   And those are the ones who are scary.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.720]   A lot of those guys actually work in the security industry.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.220]   And--
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.280]   Thank God.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:29.800]   Yes?
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.760]   Well, no.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.960]   They're bad guys in the security?
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.120]   They're bad guys in good guys.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.280]   Yeah, the bad guys are also the bad guys they get caught in.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.480]   They become good guys.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.720]   They're a good bumper of those.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.120]   But then they're also good people posing as good guys
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:40.920]   who are bad guys?
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.280]   So there's gray hats, white hats, and black hats.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.240]   And the worst part is the gray hats
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.040]   now that have risen to fame are doing it just for the fun of it.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.480]   Whereas the white hats, they want to get some notoriety
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.160]   and the black hats want to make money.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.360]   There's no rhyme or reason for the gray hats.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.720]   And so they get the black hat.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.080]   The security conferences, actually,
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.920]   the US government's recruiting a lot more
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.200]   at their try to get people to help them defend,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.920]   because you don't want to have--
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.360]   I mean, NBC, Twitter, hacked is well compared
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.440]   to what a really good hacker could really do.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.440]   And they could do some really, really just terrible things.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.920]   Let's talk about Komodo hacker, because this
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.080]   is the guy who first hacked Komodo,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.800]   and there's security certificates.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.720]   And most recently, hacked Digi Notar,
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:33.040]   which is a certificate authority based in Holland.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.920]   And by doing so, issued certificates for a lot of sites,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.680]   including Google, those Google certificates
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.440]   were used by the Iranian government
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.840]   to hack hundreds of Gmail accounts, maybe thousands
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.800]   of Gmail accounts in Iran, looking for dissidents.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   But this guy, Komodo hacker-- in fact,
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.160]   let me see if I can find his paste bin,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.400]   because he's published a manifesto.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.440]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.680]   Let me see if I can--
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.320]   Well, that's something certainly over the last couple
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.480]   of years you've noticed a trend of--
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.560]   it's almost as though hackers are trying
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.680]   to package themselves.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.720]   They're interested in branding in a way
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.080]   that you certainly didn't see five, 10 years ago.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.640]   Branding?
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.160]   I like how you're putting that.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.200]   It's a social media strategy, actually.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.320]   We're looking to improve the--
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.160]   So he calls himself-- look at this one.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.240]   This is in his second response.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.360]   Do you know the meaning of unstoppable genius digital hacker?
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   That's what he's calling himself.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.040]   He says he's 21 years old, and he's just getting started.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.240]   He's not associated with the Iranian government.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.400]   He just gave them the certificates.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.960]   He did embarrass, I think, embarrass some people in this.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.240]   For instance, he showed a password--
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.560]   administrative password that he hacked-- that was kind
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.440]   of trivially weak at a jigy notar.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.000]   He also says it should be added in the Wikipedia article
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.320]   for SSL that I removed SSL or CA's certificate model.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.040]   And now he has a better way, which someday he'll tell us
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.960]   about just the imagine, I mean, the ego and the--
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.320]   And yet, what we don't know is this could be disinformation.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.400]   It could have been the Iranian government that did the hacking.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   But I have to say, reading this, it feels like there is somebody.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.160]   This is a person.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.680]   And the least--
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.400]   He'll let us anger him quickly.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.120]   Well, apparently we have because our site is now offline,
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.320]   and this show is over.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.760]   Thank you very much.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.120]   It's been real, people.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.840]   Good night.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.600]   Let me see if I can find his other paste bin.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.200]   He's got quite a few of these--
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.000]   let me show you the password here.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.440]   He, by the way, one of the reasons this is credible
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.760]   is that he posted the public key certificate for Digi Notar,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.960]   which only Hacker would have had access to.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.640]   I signed Windows Calculator using Google cert.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.400]   That's proof.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.040]   Very interesting.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.560]   I mean, this certainly is-- whoever sent this is genuine.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.920]   But a little-- just a little bit creepy.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.040]   Nothing much more to say here.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.400]   I probably shouldn't have said anything at all.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.080]   Yeah, that's sort of the lose, lose scenario, is it?
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.000]   I'm not going to be--
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.200]   The worst case you're giving them--
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.840]   That's not the case you're giving them velocity.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.320]   Let the terror--
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.400]   We've got a great panel here.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.720]   And we are glad to be talking about the tech news
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.040]   with Nick Milton of the New York Times, Brian Brushwood,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.360]   of scam school at NSFW, Ben Parr at Mashable, Liz Gaines
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.240]   of all things deep.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.680]   We're going to get you to talk more, Liz.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.640]   I'm not an expert on 9/11.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.280]   We'll move on.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.480]   What are you an expert on, Liz?
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:40.680]   We'll get you.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.880]   All sorts of others out.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.400]   OK.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.680]   We want to talk about the ATTT mobile.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.280]   Let's talk about Carol Bartz.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.120]   How much money she's getting for calling the Yahoo board
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.440]   doofuses?
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   Maybe they're not.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.240]   14 million dollars.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.080]   Yeah, 14.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   Maybe they're not related.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.680]   With direct correlation.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   But before we do that, I want to talk a little bit about go
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.360]   to mypc.com from the great folks at Citrix.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.000]   Go to mypc is remote access done right.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.960]   If you were going to take remote access and design it
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.600]   to make it easy for you to use, to make it fast, simple,
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.680]   and efficient, this is what you would come up with.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.960]   Go to mypc.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.960]   I'll give you some examples.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.280]   First of all, 128-bit SSL.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:17.920]   Point to point.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.640]   You could use it as really if you're an open Wi-Fi access
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:20.960]   spot.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.520]   Use your go to mypc account as a way to surf safely,
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.400]   for instance.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.680]   All you have to do to install it.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.440]   You don't need help with the IT department.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.040]   It uses something called NAT traversal,
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.920]   so you don't have to open ports anywhere.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.400]   You merely install it on your computer at work, Mac or PC
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.160]   or your computer at home, whichever computer you want to
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:37.880]   access.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.320]   And then hit the road.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.000]   There's a free go to mypc app, free go to mypc app
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.200]   for your iPad.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.480]   It's kind of cool to be using your iPad accessing a Windows
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.320]   machine.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.960]   It just feels wrong.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.480]   Dirty.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.320]   Dirty.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:49.680]   Somehow.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.360]   But it works.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.960]   That's amazing.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.640]   Mac 2, totally securely, totally quick too.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.360]   They have some very advanced technology
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.840]   that means that it feels like you're there.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.960]   You can run any program, access any network resource,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.880]   of course, send and receive email.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   Work remotely.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.200]   Never go without files, programs, or email again.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.840]   Here's how you try it free for 30 days.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.920]   Visit go to mypc.com.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.880]   Click this orange try it free button.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.600]   And you could buy it, but I like it if you try it free.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.480]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.960]   And then use the offer code TWIT TWIT when you sign up.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.000]   30 days for free.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.040]   Give it a shot.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.360]   It is just fantastic.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.640]   Works great online.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.040]   Works great on all versions of Windows, except Windows 95.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   Not so hot on that.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.240]   You know what else is?
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.000]   You could actually-- it's not tied to just one computer.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.360]   It's one computer at a time.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.000]   But I had it on my studio.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.360]   To win them on the road, I could access the studio PC.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.600]   But then I dismantled my studio PC.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.280]   And I said, what if I need to get some on my office?
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.240]   You should transfer the account.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.920]   So I transfer the account over the office.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.240]   And then I used the studio PC when we were at DragonCon
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   to access the office.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.600]   I should have mentioned that.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.640]   It's very cool.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.840]   Were you using a DragonCon?
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.400]   Wow.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.560]   That's awesome.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.640]   In fact, once I even--
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.520]   I accessed my studio remotely from a hotel room,
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.360]   we set up two iPhones.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.280]   And using remote access, I had the studio
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.800]   called a Skype on each of the iPhones.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.560]   And then I live switched using BitBlaster
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.600]   through GoToMyPC from-- and it actually
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.600]   looked better to everyone at home than it looked to me,
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   because I was seeing it remotely.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.760]   I had no idea you were doing that.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.040]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.800]   It was insane, yeah.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.160]   Well, there you go.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.280]   That's a great endorsement of GoToMyPC.com.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.920]   Give it a try today.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.440]   So Carol Bartz, I just love this.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.680]   She's the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.000]   Maybe not anymore, though.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.280]   This might be the end of it.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.120]   I hope not.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.880]   That'll be the last we hear of her.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.880]   She famously foulled out.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.400]   She's not--
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.880]   She famously foulled out.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.560]   Which is great.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.960]   I kind of admire a CEO that says what she means
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.440]   and means what she says.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.000]   She hired what it was, 30 months ago, something like that,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.800]   two and a half years ago, to save Yahoo.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.920]   First of all, does Yahoo need saving?
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.000]   Liz, what do you think?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.680]   Yes.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.160]   Definitely.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.760]   But they've got great properties.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.960]   I'm always amazed because people will say, well,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.800]   what about TV.com?
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   I say, oh, Yahoo owns that?
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.400]   Or what about OMG.com?
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   You ever look at OMG?
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.160]   OMG is huge.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.120]   And Yahoo's finding it's still a very, very good tool.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.000]   And Yahoo's sports is still very big.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.440]   And Yahoo News homepage is still one of the biggest traffic
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.840]   drivers to most sites on the web.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.640]   And we just saw--
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.440]   I mean, that's why you should care.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.960]   Well, this is a company that has valuable products.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.760]   We just saw that list of top 10 websites 10 years ago.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.440]   And today, Yahoo is one down.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.120]   And it was two then.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.840]   It's three down.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.000]   I mean, it's still a strong site.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.600]   So why is it so hard for the board?
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.280]   And I have to blame the board as much as I would blame Carol
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.760]   Bartz for this.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.120]   She called him doofuses.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.320]   Violating, I think, her disparagement clause, which
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.400]   may cost her some money.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.200]   Because apparently, it's a $14 million termination fee.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.280]   Wow.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.520]   No, she got--
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.360]   I think probably what happened is
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.800]   she resigned from-- she didn't resign from the board
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.920]   when she was fired.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.000]   So here's the deal.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.760]   The chairman of the board is going on an airplane one way.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.400]   She's going on an airplane another way.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.280]   So some people said, oh, that's so cold to fire her on the phone.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.000]   This is metaphor?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.520]   This is real life.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.320]   This is real.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.080]   This is a metaphor?
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.040]   This is an unreal life.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.360]   So they had to do it by phone.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.520]   He was reading from a script.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.400]   He calls her up, said, Carol, you're fired.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.200]   You ignorant, slut, and go away.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.040]   It said that on the script.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.880]   That's not--
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.600]   It was an old Saturday night live script as a matter of fact.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.000]   You're supposed to read a legal script.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.400]   It's a reading old Saturday live.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:26.960]   Look, it's--
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.760]   No, and of course, she and me-- now, this mistake number one.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.080]   First, you call the IT guy and say, turn off the email.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.960]   Then you call Carol.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.400]   Not the other way around.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.560]   So she gets one last email, I'll add a little shot from--
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.480]   sent from her iPad, which I thought was kind of cute,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.920]   saying, they just fired me by phone.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.800]   Which I think is-- you know, it's a little bit of a shot.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.160]   Let's face it.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.120]   But she's still on the board.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.600]   It's an ambiguity in there, at least in the interview
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.640]   that she gave, that she was kind of given an option of,
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.240]   how do you want to word this?
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.480]   So she--
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.760]   But it all fell apart before then.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.680]   Apparently her broke up.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.360]   So in the script, it said, now, Carol, let's come up with a story.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.240]   Exactly.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.000]   And she-- but see, that's not Carol Barnes's.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.800]   No.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.160]   Story Schmory.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.080]   Do you think that she is at fault or is the Yahoo board at fault?
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.040]   I mean, I have to say, she was given a very tough task
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.800]   to figure out how to take all these disparate but valuable
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.720]   pieces and sew them in.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.560]   Delicious, terrible, flicker, ignored.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.360]   I mean, the things languished for her under her care.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.600]   Well, I think that the them languishing shows
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.520]   that what Yahoo did not need was someone
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.520]   to be blustery and boost morale.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.840]   That was not going to fix everything.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.080]   That's what she tried to do.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.400]   But she didn't try to do a lot of other things.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.160]   That's very superficial to say, well, let's get the morale up.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.680]   You get the morale up by giving each of these talented divisions
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.120]   the respect they deserve.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.440]   Yeah, but I mean, when you talk about flicker and delicious,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.520]   they weren't money-making.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.080]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.160]   Flicker is a huge dream.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.080]   They're brands that I think in our world,
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.840]   they're seen as affluent and exciting.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.760]   But wouldn't you go to, let's say, Google
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.720]   and say, hey, would you like to buy this flicker division?
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   Because this is lots of value.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.240]   Absolutely.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.240]   That's what they should have.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   They should have turned them off.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.960]   They should have put some resources behind them,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.280]   not just threaten to shut them down.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.400]   And the things that I, as Geeks, and maybe you as Geeks,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.240]   would think about like boss, build your own search engine,
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   which was a really cool thing.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.280]   Yahoo pipes.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.840]   They were-- they had some great programmers making great products.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.640]   Of course, only Geeks knew about those products.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.240]   They touched on some of that.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   I mean, they spun off Hadoop, right?
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.520]   Like, they turned some of their core technology
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.640]   innovations into something worthwhile.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.240]   I mean, I guess-- I don't know.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.560]   I hate that line about you have to decide who you are.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.720]   Are you a media company?
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.800]   Are you an ad company?
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.560]   Are you a technology company?
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.040]   But I think it kind of comes into that.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.540]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   I think--
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.600]   The release not a lot of leadership shown in any of those.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.440]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.520]   I don't think they need saving.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.640]   I think they need a direction.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.640]   And they don't have one.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.840]   They need a director, right?
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.080]   Well, yeah, you need a director to pick a director with a direction.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.080]   Right.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.360]   The director doesn't matter if the train goes 15 different ways.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.760]   And the problem is, Yahoo can't seem to decide what it wants to be.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.480]   And that's what's so bizarre about this flirtation
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.840]   that they're doing with AOL.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.240]   It's like, if you got two--
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.880]   And I was talking to Justin Rauber-Young about this earlier today.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   There's never been a case where two aimless amorphous blobs
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.120]   of companies ever mashed up and then suddenly had a direction.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.520]   Oh, let's be clear.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.960]   Yahoo is not flirted with him.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.520]   Maybe Armstrong was thinking, oh, maybe I can try again
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.680]   at the very, very most.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.440]   But Yahoo is never going to seriously
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.920]   consider merging with AOL.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.760]   It makes no sense.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.200]   I think Cara said in all things, too.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.560]   She said, never, no way, know how.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.080]   And if Cara says that, I believe her.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.680]   She went-- she said was very, very, very clear.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.520]   I think in the end with it, it's just you--
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.440]   they put in somebody to find more efficiencies in the system.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.160]   Bart's is not a visionary leader.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.400]   She's an efficiency.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.240]   She got it made art of desk efficient.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.560]   So they thought she could do the same thing for Yahoo.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.200]   What they really needed is someone
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.400]   with more vision that can set a direction.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.040]   The problem was when they tried that last time,
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.880]   that was with Jerry Yang, the co-founder.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.760]   And while we all, like, in Silicon Valley,
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.160]   love having co-founders as CEOs, he didn't succeed in--
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.000]   He couldn't do it either.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.200]   He didn't succeed either.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.360]   I think where Yahoo really started to mess up
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.680]   was when they shut down Brick House.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.280]   And so if you look at the people that were there
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.600]   that were running it, you've got Chad Dickerson, who's now
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.800]   the CEO of Etsy.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.480]   You've got Bradley Horowitz, who's running all of product
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:14.760]   at Google.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.280]   Wow.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.840]   He built Google+, he did buzz.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.480]   He's done running Gmail.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.360]   I mean, these are--
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.280]   Cattering fake.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.640]   It was with the crowd.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   So what was Brick House?
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.560]   That was a--
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.480]   Brick House was in the city.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.840]   But they never really believed in that.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.440]   I don't think.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:26.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:27.840]   It was like a research lab.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.720]   And there was 100 people.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.840]   And they were responsible for--
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.400]   you had Daniel Raffle, who has his own startup.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.320]   Now you had all these people that were--
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.880]   That's where pipes came from, by the way.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   That's where pipes came from.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.960]   Remember Fire Eagle?
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.480]   Yep.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.000]   Oh my god.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.600]   Yahoo's location thing?
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.080]   I couldn't even figure out why they did it.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.640]   So that was exactly it, right?
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.080]   It was like they took all the people
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.480]   inside the company who really would have rather
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.520]   been working at startups.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.440]   And they put them into a building and said,
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.840]   pretend you're at a startup.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.560]   And then they didn't support any of their products.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.440]   And then they shut it down in.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.880]   And 2008, they shut it down.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.560]   Yep.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.920]   And since then, a lot of the people
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.920]   that were there have gone on to do pretty successful
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.520]   and amazing things.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.280]   But I don't think that it was ever really working.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.400]   It wasn't like a big, huge thing that they stopped believing
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.400]   and it was just--
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.200]   Well, it sounds like just this endless,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.400]   ever-since Terry Semmel, who was Mr. Hollywood,
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.320]   ran it and built things like OMG.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.720]   It sounds like this endless litany of failure.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.840]   So the answer, I guess, to the question,
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.480]   who's to blame Carol Bartz of the board?
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.320]   Yes, it's all of the above, right?
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.840]   I mean, the board is a bunch of doofuses.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.760]   Somebody, I don't remember who, probably John C.D. of works,
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.240]   so they should fire them all.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.920]   Well, I think the problem is that the company
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.080]   isn't looking at long-term gains or looking at short-term gains.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.040]   And if they don't see them instantly,
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.960]   then they shut something down.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.480]   And then I don't think they're--
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.680]   I mean, I personally don't see them
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.720]   looking at the big picture of what two to five years from now.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.120]   I don't know what they can do at this point.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:49.480]   The two-patient.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.280]   Yeah, they're way too impatient.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.400]   How long was Carol there for?
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.360]   I mean, it wasn't--
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.600]   January 2011, 2009 to now.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   That's just over two and a half years.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   And from people I've spoken to within Yahoo,
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.040]   it was very difficult to make changes.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.680]   Because of the organizational structure.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.040]   If you have the stomach for it, it
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.920]   could be a really great place to work right now.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.000]   I mean, there's--
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.520]   Really?
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.560]   Because there's opportunity.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.400]   Yeah, I know people have got over to Yahoo.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.520]   And I was speaking this week with someone
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.080]   who's working on their social efforts.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.560]   And they have incredible opportunities
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.720]   to kind of socialize some of their media consumption
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.040]   experiences that Facebook could try to start to do that.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.400]   But no one goes to Facebook to consume media yet.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.040]   So they'd have to be starting from scratch.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.200]   All right, you're in charge of Yahoo.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.320]   What would you do?
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   Come on, Liz.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.400]   I want to give you a job.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.440]   I've just gave-- yeah, no.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.840]   I got to work on my scary--
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.400]   Carol, interview with the Fortune Magazine's Patty Sellers.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.600]   Carol Bart says, "These people, after me, over."
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.120]   Jeez, low-weeds.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.040]   I don't know, though.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.640]   I mean, I do have some sympathy for her
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.200]   in that they knew it wasn't working for a long time.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.520]   Why was this week so important?
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.120]   Why could they not have figured out anything
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.400]   before just dropping the bomb?
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.600]   Once they make that decision, they
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.040]   have to just-- they can't wait a week
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.960]   and try to work it out.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.480]   They did.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.280]   I mean, they should have fired her a while ago.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.840]   I mean, when they're working for a long time.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.520]   Yeah, they should have.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.600]   I think that's part of--
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.160]   So who can-- I mean, I can't imagine.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.320]   I heard the rumors this week that Yahoo and AOL
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.880]   would get together and--
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.440]   That's not right.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.280]   No, we know that's not true.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.800]   I just can't-- I don't know who can come in and--
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.000]   Who would have thought, though, here we
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.920]   would be talking about Yahoo and AOL
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.080]   and that AOL would be in better shape in 2011 than Yahoo
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:36.960]   would be.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.040]   That's just bizarre.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.800]   Well, I think someone at AOL just wanted everyone
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.120]   to stop talking about tech crunch.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.440]   So they're like, oh, we'll come with Yahoo.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.200]   Yeah, hey, that's a good idea.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.520]   That distracts everybody.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.320]   It's a misdirection.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.040]   You're a magician.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.640]   You know how that works.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.200]   Pay no attention.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.960]   Actually, the big mistake was when
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.400]   they turned down Microsoft, which offered $31.33.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   $33?
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   Yeah, I'm that.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.160]   They're currently Yahoo's worth less than $15 a share
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.520]   if they had accepted Microsoft at $33.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.240]   And they said, oh, no, we're worth more than that.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.760]   They wouldn't take it.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.920]   Crazy.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.080]   I don't suppose they're going to get a second chance on that one.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.240]   Well, and I don't think they're ever going to--
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.920]   they've lost so much positioning.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.440]   I mean, they were almost synonymous with search for a while.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.080]   I mean, and to be honest, I still
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.240]   don't have a one-word answer for what they are nowadays.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:24.720]   Right.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.880]   That's not search because Microsoft does the search.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.760]   It's Bing.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.320]   Absolutely.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.440]   I think Microsoft could come back in and get them on a fire
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:30.640]   sale.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.080]   Do you think Microsoft still wants them?
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   No.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   No.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.280]   I got the search to you.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.520]   Steve Ballmer went--
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.520]   [WOOOOSH]
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.200]   Whoa, that was close.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.520]   Bart's in the interview says that she wasn't given enough time.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.900]   She said to Fortune, they want revenue growth.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.640]   Even though I told them there will be no revenue growth until 2012,
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:56.200]   the board was so spooked by being the worst cast as the worst
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.280]   board in the country.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.400]   Now they're not-- they're trying to show them
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.200]   that they're not the doofuses that they are.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.800]   OK, so that's the disparagement right there is--
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.600]   --is saying--
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.640]   because that was like a double negative, too.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.000]   Well, that and calling them Efors.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.800]   Well, yes.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.400]   And I don't--
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.300]   I don't know the exact intricacies of what's being argued over,
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.140]   but I think the whole payoff has a lot more to do
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.140]   with the fact that they fired her than whether or not
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:22.700]   she's on the board.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.200]   Right.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.340]   It was pretty clear she wasn't going to be on the board
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.300]   if she's been fired.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.380]   I think she owned the company.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.260]   Yeah, she should not--
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.900]   She said, and I'm going to stay on on the board.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.620]   It's like, that's not--
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.260]   She said she plans to stay on the board.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.780]   She resigned on Friday.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.300]   I think they probably said, if you just resign and just--
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.900]   I don't know if she's the rest of the time--
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.540]   will give you $14 million.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.100]   So just please be quiet.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.020]   It's a good deal for her.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.640]   And I don't know what they're going to do at this point.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.680]   But it's kind of sad.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.360]   I mean, this is a great company with--
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.480]   It really depends who they're putting in the CEO.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.320]   Who is there?
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.320]   If Leo--
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.760]   Beyond Leo and Mike Arrington.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.840]   I could run that company into the ground real quick.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.960]   All right, Mike Arrington, now we
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.520]   got to talk about Mike Arrington.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.800]   What is there to say about Mike Arrington?
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.200]   All right, we're done.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.040]   Let's move on.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.360]   I think Ben Parr, if you were thanking Carol Bartz
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.520]   for all the good text, I think you
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.360]   got to thank Mike Arrington.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.000]   He's great.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.500]   I think this is great.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.860]   So just to summarize--
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.140]   I can't even summarize.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.820]   This is something we saw coming.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.100]   The day that AOL announced, the day that Mike Arrington goes
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.500]   on stage with Tim Armstrong, says,
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.380]   yeah, we're great buddies.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.660]   We're going to-- it's going to be great.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.900]   You knew this day was not far off.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.380]   One year, almost to the day later--
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.620]   Yep.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:37.100]   First he slams in gadget, which is Yahoo's number one property.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.900]   AOL's number one property saying,
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:39.660]   they're not journalists.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.500]   I don't know what he said.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.580]   It was ridiculous.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.500]   Joshua Topolsky and Neil I Patel believe surely thereafter,
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.020]   rightly so.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.660]   In fact, Topolsky tweeted, I am so glad I don't work for AOL
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:52.060]   right now, just the other day.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.420]   Then what else happened?
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.460]   The memo, the AOL private company memo
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.460]   that he released immediately.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.540]   But you'd expect that.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.400]   He's independent.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.220]   In fact, I think that was probably good journalism.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.060]   But he was rattling the cage.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.420]   It looked like he wanted to get out of there.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.020]   And of course, finally, he starts The Crunch Fund, which
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.900]   is a $20 million venture fund that's
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.780]   designed to invest in the companies that Tech Crunch covers.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.540]   Now, AOL must have known this was coming,
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.860]   because this is what Tech Crunch was started to do.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:18.380]   So--
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.140]   Well, you all invested in the fund.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.100]   Yeah, and they put $10 million into the $20 million fund.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.180]   So it's very confusing.
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.300]   But then Ariana Huffington-- this is the problem.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.100]   Ariana says, well, you can't make me have this man.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.700]   Yes.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.300]   Can't edit.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.340]   Is that a new voice for Leo?
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.340]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:33.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.740]   Iana starts an op-list.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.380]   He says, no, darling, this man cannot edit.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.060]   But he's a good car.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.460]   So-- and that's the problem.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.580]   Actually, I feel sorry for Tim Armstrong,
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.020]   because he's got, on the one hand, two--
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.700]   he's got two very strong personalities.
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.220]   He's in a polygamous relationship with Ariana and Ariana.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.140]   They're both shooting at each other.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.900]   And he's in the middle.
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.260]   I'd hate to be in his shoes, right?
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.900]   Well, so OK, so number one, I assume
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.580]   that the problem as it's being stated is like, well,
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.500]   there's a conflict of interest is bad for the block.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.860]   Well, they fire Mike, then he quit after the--
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.340]   I love that.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340]   They fired him for the quit.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.380]   I really love that.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.140]   He said, well, I'm going to quit.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.180]   And they said, unless-- and unless you fire--
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.260]   I can't remember what he says.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.540]   It was either unless you sell it back to us or you--
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.460]   Let us choose the next executive editor.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.980]   Be full editorial control.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.900]   Full editorial control.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.340]   Which I respect.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.500]   He says the deal along was we would
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.740]   have full editorial control.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.660]   And by the way, all his writers are standing by him.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:33.500]   MG, Paul Carr, everybody's standing by him,
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.020]   saying we want full editorial control.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.100]   I don't blame him.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.900]   Is that possible as an AOL entity?
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.580]   It depends how much input Ariana has.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.580]   She wants to run it.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.780]   She wants to run it.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.100]   She wants to run it.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.460]   She doesn't want to have this--
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.460]   It's mine, darling.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.460]   It's mine.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.260]   She doesn't want to have this media organization that's--
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.540]   she runs the media empire.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.340]   That's what Tim basically gave to her,
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.580]   except for this one little one in the corner.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.700]   That's not going to fly--
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.460]   But that's what he said.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.180]   He said we understand that TechCrunch is
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.860]   a different kind of journalistic entity.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:11.380]   But they can't put TechCrunch within AOL or within Huff and
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.180]   Post because it is so different.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.500]   It's an opinion.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.940]   So they either give it full control, or they move on.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.620]   I've kind of changed my tune at first.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.980]   And I'll be curious what you think, Nick,
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.020]   because the New York Times is famous for you're not allowed
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.660]   to invest.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.740]   The Times has this investment fund, by the way.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.660]   Which Mike pointed out.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.020]   But it's completely separate.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.020]   Completely separate.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.420]   I couldn't give you a doll right now.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.420]   Right.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.020]   You want one?
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:37.820]   Five.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.740]   Because I'll say no.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.540]   I'll give you a break.
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.100]   Just kidding.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.060]   I'll buy a break.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.780]   But The Times is famous for its editorial independence.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.380]   And I still respect The Times for that.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.700]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:51.100]   As a journalist, I thought this is the one thing we don't need.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.980]   Whenever you have a trade press, whether it's automobiles,
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.700]   stereo, the US government, whenever you have a group covering
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.940]   a small group, there's always this kind of problem
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.820]   with socializing, getting them know inside the beltway
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.660]   journalism.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.940]   And as a tech journalist, I always
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.860]   feel like we have to be way above suspicion.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.340]   I mean, it's really important because people,
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.900]   I think, assume that, well, your advertisers
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.860]   influence your coverage.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.140]   And we certainly wouldn't expect you
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.900]   to be independent and objective.
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:21.900]   So we really want to.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.620]   So at first, I was kind of offended by Mike's point of view.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.980]   But I've kind of the other way.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.340]   It's like, well, it's tech crunch.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.620]   It was never intended to be independent.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.620]   It was, Mike said at the beginning that day one,
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.180]   when he founded tech crunch, I just
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.020]   want access to the deal flow.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.740]   This is a blog that will give me access to the deal flow.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.260]   Well, and certainly, there's a number of blogs out there.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.140]   And I don't know if the landscape of journalism
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.660]   is changing, obviously, with blogs in general.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.500]   But is anybody surprised that there's hidden or not
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.300]   disclosed things?
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.300]   Well, this is the thing that bugs me that I don't like,
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.540]   which is that Aerington says, oh, everybody does it.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.060]   Well, that's--
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.500]   So this is a thing--
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.100]   That's what bugs mean.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.740]   OK, so I've been at The Times for eight years.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.620]   I became a reporter two years ago.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.820]   And made a lot of friends in the tech world.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.580]   In the six years before, because I worked at the research
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.540]   labs and did a lot of public speaking.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.540]   And I remember when I first started reporting for the BITS
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.260]   blog, and I'm not going to mention any names,
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.620]   but a good friend of mine started a startup
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.020]   and gave it to Aerington and TechCrunch.
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.820]   And I called him up, and I said, what are you doing?
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.820]   You know that I just started.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.700]   He said, look, it's nothing against you.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.700]   But if I don't give it to Mike, they're
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.060]   going to write a negative review.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.100]   If I don't give it to him first.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.660]   And that happened over and over and over again.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.820]   And I don't necessarily think that's journalism.
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.700]   And that's where I have problems.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.060]   There are things where he invests in funds and things
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.300]   like that that I have problems with.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.620]   I think he's a brilliant guy.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.620]   He made TechCrunch literally out of thin air.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.660]   But to compare TechCrunch to other entities
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.180]   and to say, well, everyone's doing it,
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.020]   I don't agree with that.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:48.500]   That's not fair.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.700]   Well, in fact, he points to Cara Swisher, who
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.420]   Liz, you work with, saying, well, her--
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.660]   Yeah, I think he's called me out as well.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.620]   You too?
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.140]   What's your conflict of interest?
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.940]   Because Cara's married to a Google executive.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.700]   I'm also married to a Stanford student who
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.220]   does work at Facebook, which is the company I covered closely.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.220]   OK.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.220]   And I don't like that conflict at all.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.660]   And I actually probably would cover Facebook more closely
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.340]   if I weren't always worried about that.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.060]   Cara pointed out, well, look, you can only marry one person.
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.060]   It's like, you know.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.540]   Exactly.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.020]   Yeah, she's made her choice.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.460]   And Cara, I mean, does this weird dance
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.820]   to stay economically or financially independent
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.620]   from her partner?
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.780]   She really works hard at it.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.540]   Look, there are conflicts of interest everywhere.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.500]   I mean, I think if I remember correctly,
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.420]   Mike was arguing when Mike--
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.780]   I was arguing with David Carr from The Times.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.740]   He brought up an example of when the Times wrote
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.940]   about the Boston Red Sox and The Times company actually
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.900]   owns part of the Boston Red Sox.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.100]   I mean, does every single article that everyone has
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:49.620]   something to do with--
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.180]   But the way that TechCrunch writes is different.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.940]   Because TechCrunch writes--
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.420]   and a lot of blogs do now.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.140]   And I do think-- I've sensed this distinction
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.540]   of having moved now from giga-ome to all things D,
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.300]   where we're really much more careful about stating
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.380]   our own opinions.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.780]   TechCrunch has an opinion in every article you're read.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.540]   You'll say--
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:07.300]   That's TechCrunch.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.220]   That's why I love it.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.420]   That's why I love TechCrunch, which
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.860]   is why I love to read it because of that.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.220]   Right.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.540]   No, but it's a much bigger journalistic question.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.620]   This is not something that should be discussed just
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.380]   within the realm of technology in TechCrunch
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.180]   and The New York Times.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.180]   And it's the question of--
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.900]   that I think is actually going to come to a head much more now
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.980]   with everyone's on Twitter and all these journalists that
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.300]   are coming out of school that have this long history of--
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.900]   I remember when I first started at The Times
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.980]   and eight years ago, and I was in a news meeting,
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.580]   and I walked out and I said to one of my editors,
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.980]   I said, what do you think about X?
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.500]   And he was like, I don't have an opinion on that.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.980]   And I was like, what do you mean you're opinion on that?
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:42.500]   Of course you do.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.060]   And he said, I'm a reporter.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:43.780]   I don't have an opinion.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.500]   I was like, come on.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.700]   I was like, you have an opinion.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.340]   I was like, I know you don't have an opinion.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.100]   But he really--
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.420]   steadfastly said, I do not have an opinion.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.140]   And if you look at my Twitter feed,
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.380]   you can tell I like mini coopers or I like M&Ms or whatever it is.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.540]   Does that mean I can't write about those things?
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.700]   Because I think the distinction is what voice--
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:09.340]   if you want your entity to be a voice of perfect neutrality
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.900]   on all these issues, then yes, it is important.
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.580]   But that was never what Tech Trust was important.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.060]   I asked Jeff Jarvis, because he's
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.060]   a professor of journalism.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.100]   I said, is this recent?
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.580]   And he said, yes, this happened when
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.420]   we went from having four newspapers in a market,
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.740]   each representing a different point of view.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.940]   Newspapers used to be very slanted.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.980]   And when they came down to one newspaper in the market,
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.380]   it was decided by the journalistic knabobs
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.620]   that we should be objective.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.260]   Our reporting should be objective.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.740]   There should be no point of view.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.700]   It should be merely the facts that people decide.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:40.980]   And that's relatively recent.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.780]   That's within the last 70 years.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:47.620]   So this idea of non-opinionated, purely objective
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.700]   is an artificial concept that I kind of like.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.500]   It's not what we do here.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.820]   I don't think the conflicts of interest
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.980]   brought TechCrunch down.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.660]   I think Mike Errington's polarizing personality
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.060]   is making it impossible for him to be a part of that picture.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.020]   And I think he'll do fine.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.460]   He was sick of it.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.900]   The reason TechCrunch was bought was because he went off stage
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.060]   with an interview with Tim Armstrong and said, I'm tired.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.060]   And Tim Armstrong said, how would I take that off your hands?
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.740]   And now it's a year later, it's gotten worse for him.
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.180]   He's had to-- now he works at this big corporate company
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.780]   where he has to file expense reports,
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.780]   and he hates it, right?
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:18.620]   We knew this would happen.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.700]   So now he gets to go be a VC.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.500]   This is not a bad outcome rate.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.260]   Which is exactly what he's wanted to do for years.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.020]   But I think we're really--
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.340]   And he loves it that we're all talking about, of course.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.860]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.780]   But you know whose fault this all is?
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:32.900]   It's really Tim's.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   Yes.
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.820]   If Tim would have--
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.500]   It's how you handle it.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.220]   I mean, Errington's not--
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.380]   And it also shows that Tim did not have a strategy.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.300]   Because there's--
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.780]   Tim had a strategy he would have bought,
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.380]   Huffington Post, and that's it.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.820]   Well, if he had thought two moves ahead,
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.420]   he would have realized what was coming.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.180]   Yeah, part of the problem was he didn't inform Ariana
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.460]   beforehand, apparently.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.100]   And Errington's not the only journalist that's also
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.580]   venture capitalist, there's several of them.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.260]   But they're not the same polarizing figure.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.300]   And honestly, if he hadn't named it Crunch Fund,
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.580]   I think there would have actually been a better outcome here.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.940]   I think what my question is is how--
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:08.420]   I respect the fact that M.G. Seagler and Paul
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.580]   Carr and all those guys are standing behind the person
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.500]   that they respect who's given them this job
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.620]   and made this name for them.
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.020]   But I wonder--
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.220]   I think they're very loyal.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.220]   They're very loyal.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.220]   And I admire that.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.420]   I think they also really love writing about themselves
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.260]   and now they have this awesome opportunity to see them.
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.140]   But what happens to them now?
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.260]   It's like, I know people that worked
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.540]   for in the Elliot Spitzer camp and their careers
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.380]   were pretty messed up because of the selfishness
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.300]   of Elliot Spitzer.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.140]   What happens to these guys now, depending
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.140]   on what happens to TechCrunch?
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.500]   I think that's my question.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.420]   Let's move on.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.060]   Because it is kind of an inside baseball argument.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.700]   I don't think the real world out there cares.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.860]   Although as journalists, we care a lot because--
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:49.780]   You're too much.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:50.500]   Well, we do.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.460]   And it really affects--
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.620]   I think what Mike's saying, and I think probably we would
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:58.380]   agree, is that you can trust our readers
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.220]   if we disclose to make the decisions about how
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.140]   objective the material they're reading
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.740]   is and whether they should judge it.
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.620]   And we certainly-- I'd certainly trust our viewers
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.100]   and our readers.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:14.380]   I wish they didn't have to be so discriminating, but they do.
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.060]   And the truth is, there probably always was some bias.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:18.980]   So it's not a bad thing to tell people, look,
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.900]   you've got to consider the source and judge
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.060]   whether that source is reliable on your own.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.380]   And I think that's appropriate.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.260]   I don't think that's inappropriate.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.340]   I think that'll be the outcome of all of this.
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.900]   We live in a new world where everybody has an opinion,
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.860]   and you just have to weigh each person
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.900]   and see if you trust that person's opinion.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:40.060]   So AT&T's opinion of T-Mobile is they're awful.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:40.780]   They're terrible.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.980]   Please let us buy them.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.620]   So it's a very interesting argument.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.860]   AT&T answered the government's lawsuit.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:53.980]   Of course, the DOJ is asking the courts to block AT&T's $39
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.140]   million take over of T-Mobile.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.300]   AT&T says, well, here's the problem.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.980]   The T-Mobile really isn't doing very well.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.660]   And we want to buy them for the wireless spectrum,
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:09.420]   not because their operations are so good.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.300]   This is almost like they're using
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.180]   that pickup or terminology.
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.820]   They're trying to neg T-Mobile in order
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.380]   to take her to bed or something.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:17.460]   OK, Mr. Scam School.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.740]   Explain how this helps them get free drinks.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.780]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.260]   Well, I'll tell you, the part that
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.060]   kills me is how disingenuous this whole thing is
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.500]   in what you want to do.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.860]   If what you want to do is bring a better consumer experience,
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.220]   here's a nutty job, take whatever money
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.540]   you're going to spend on T-Mobile
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.220]   and spend it to improve your service.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.780]   Which we found out, by the way, thanks to a leaked memo,
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.420]   their own lawyers leaked a memo that
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.260]   said it would cost us $3.9 billion
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.500]   to get to the 97% 4G coverage that we're claiming
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.860]   is the big benefit of the AT&T T-Mobile merger.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:47.380]   Right.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.580]   For 10 times more.
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.620]   Right, exactly.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.020]   DOJ, I mean, the AT&T says, quote,
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.100]   T-Mobile is losing customers and subscribers
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.300]   shares in a growing market is not
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.540]   a unique or material competitive constraint on AT&T
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.660]   and will not be one going forward in the absence
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.580]   of this transaction.
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:08.300]   In other words, these guys is history anyway.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.500]   You really should let us merge.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.980]   You know, there is a reason-- there
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.780]   is maybe some precedent for that because, of course,
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.780]   the federal government allowed-- there are only two satellite
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.700]   radio services in the US, and they allowed
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.860]   XM and Sirius to merge because the argument was,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.740]   they're going to go under without us,
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:25.540]   without the merger.
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.100]   Well, I don't think we're running that threat with AT&T.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.700]   AT&T ain't going under, but what if AT&T
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.460]   mobile would anyway?
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.660]   Well, why not let them buy?
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.700]   AT&T, no, but then let them go down
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.420]   and then let them-- AT&T come in and buy it on a fire sale.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.940]   Yeah, I mean, I don't understand.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.260]   Is there one person-- I would love to have a drink with the one
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.820]   person who thinks this is a great idea,
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.500]   and that consumers will win.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.780]   Well, we can go over AT&T.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.260]   We can go over to AT&T headquarters,
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.260]   and I'm sure we can find a couple.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.700]   We'll find that person to buy you a drink.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.620]   In fact, here it is.
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.700]   The merger is good for consumers, says AT&T.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.460]   The combination of T-Mobile and AT&T
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.180]   is good for consumers.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.700]   Integrating the two networks will free up spectrum
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.540]   and create substantial new capacity
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.380]   to meet the spectacular growth in demand resulting
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.260]   from an increasingly online world.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.820]   They're just throwing crap in there, aren't they?
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.660]   They just phrases, random phrases.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.180]   The book, The Master Switch by Tim Wu.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:13.680]   Tim Wu.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.540]   He said this would happen.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.540]   Yeah, he said this would happen.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.100]   And what he did was he went back and looked at the history
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.140]   of trying to relate to the internet and startups and--
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.420]   He used long distance services, as an example.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.100]   He used long distance.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.860]   So apparently, back when AT&T and all those guys first
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.660]   started out, it was essentially the internet
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.460]   of the telephone long distance era.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.380]   And there were thousands and thousands
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.620]   of these companies that offered long distance service
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.140]   and AT&T gobbled them all up and ended up
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.660]   having a monopoly over long distance.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.540]   And we kind of got screwed, as we always do.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.940]   And the same thing could happen again.
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.940]   I respect Tim a lot.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.940]   We're trying to get him on, but he works now for the FTC.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.540]   Yeah, he works for the FTC.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.580]   So that's not going on.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.780]   And you probably have the same problem.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:53.260]   He won't talk.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.900]   He says, well, the FTC doesn't like me to talk.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.140]   But Tim, I think there is an argument
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.500]   that, yes, it's certainly important to look at history.
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.420]   And history does sometimes repeat itself.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.180]   His position is that all new technologies start open,
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.300]   and then the powers become closed.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.340]   Powers that be make sure it becomes closed.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.220]   Like the ACC originally with the answer machine,
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.820]   they tried to block it because they
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.660]   believed that it would make people not need to have phone
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.060]   services and things like that.
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:18.820]   And they probably should have.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.420]   But too late.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.500]   Too late.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.980]   It's all the fault of the answering machine.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.420]   I just think that the internet is more resilient
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.500]   than long distance service.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.780]   And I'm not so worried about it.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.980]   Well, it is, and it isn't.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:32.020]   And this is probably a great discussion,
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.300]   because the internet is more resilient because it's
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.940]   an open platform, and it's why it's
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.900]   going to end up beating apps probably on mobile devices.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.900]   However, the wires that we use for the internet
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.060]   are all owned by AT&T and Verizon.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.620]   Very, very few.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.620]   The cable companies and just a few.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:50.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.980]   But again, I mean, on the flip side--
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.620]   we've been through this before on Twitch.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.260]   But I mean, keep in mind, it's easy to say, well,
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.740]   our wires are owned just by a few people.
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.300]   There are emerging technologies that have clear wires doing,
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.420]   over the Air Y-Max.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.900]   And you have other--
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.420]   So Sprint immediately acquired them?
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.580]   Yeah, well, there is that.
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.060]   I am not helping my point, Leo.
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.020]   I have two words for you-- Google Fiber.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:14.540]   I agree.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.860]   Yeah, I am praying.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.980]   In fact, I keep watching this DOJ action,
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.980]   hoping that perhaps it maybe puts Sprint into play,
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.500]   maybe puts T-Mobile back into play,
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.420]   and that somebody like Google or Apple will come along.
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.740]   Apple by Sprint.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.180]   It would be a $16 billion.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.180]   Wow.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.180]   They could pay cash.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.100]   I mean, everyone's been speculating,
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.220]   talking more about Apple buying a carrier.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.660]   I just can't see it.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.300]   I can understand why it might make sense,
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.260]   but I just can't see it.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:39.820]   Let's take a break.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:42.020]   I want to know why Nick thinks it's a good idea.
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.060]   And maybe Google buying somebody too, or not?
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.820]   Well, I mean, Google buying somebody or Apple.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.900]   Google buys to mobile Apple by Sprint.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.420]   How about that?
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.460]   I would be sure it sounds good.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.420]   All right, let's talk about it.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.180]   No one can afford AT&T.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.900]   Right, so it has to be a little one.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.900]   But Apple and Google have plenty of cash.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.460]   And they could pay cash.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.300]   They could write a check.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.620]   Apple's got $74 billion now.
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:05.420]   Yeah, they could write a check.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.020]   Wow.
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.020]   Let's talk about it in a second.
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.260]   First I want to talk about backing up.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.140]   We've got a great panel here.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:13.340]   Nick Bilton from The Times, Brian Brushwood from NSFW,
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:17.420]   Ben Parr from Mashable, Liz Gaines from All Things D.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.780]   Yeah, I didn't realize you used to work for home.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.140]   Four years.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:21.980]   I love home.
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.060]   I love home too.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.140]   He's-- he called me the Yoda of the internet.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.020]   I think he's the Yoda of the internet.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.140]   He is the Yoda of the internet.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.860]   I have edited his stories enough.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.060]   Who is his famous layer?
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:31.940]   He's much more similar.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:32.940]   Shoot.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.220]   She is.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.860]   That's where he learned his craft.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.540]   Yeah, yeah, home's just amazing.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:41.100]   I just think he's a great guy.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.300]   However, I also think all things D is fantastic.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.020]   Those are two really-- now, by the way,
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.060]   home was used as an example by my character.
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.660]   He said, look, home's investing.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.940]   How come home mallet gets away with investing?
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.580]   Gigalome gets away with investing.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.820]   And nobody says word one.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.420]   And then Mike Harrington does it.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.860]   What's the difference?
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.620]   You know, it's-- I don't think that you can--
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:01.700]   Personally, like a disability.
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:02.700]   Like a disability or something.
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:03.940]   It's all about perception.
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:04.660]   It's not about the actual--
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:05.300]   It's perception.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.460]   Yeah, I mean, as a gig or home reporter,
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.420]   I was totally uncomfortable with that relationship
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.260]   because it was someone else's conflict that I had
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.260]   to disclose that I was a weird place.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.260]   It was not a happy thing for me as a reporter.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:16.340]   You don't want to be putting that situation.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.860]   But I think, you know, home is kind of--
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.540]   home is not a daily reporter anymore.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.100]   He writes kind of columns about his intuitions,
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.980]   which are often right about--
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:24.980]   Well, I read--
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:25.980]   --things way far off in the future.
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.060]   And it's not really about the kind of deal flow
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.060]   that he's doing.
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.260]   I read Fred Wilson for the same reason.
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.820]   I mean, he's a venture capitalist.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:32.900]   He's got investments.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.100]   But I don't read him for his reviews of what, you know,
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.340]   a web 2.0 company and whether it's a good company.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.460]   I read him for his insights.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.100]   And I think the same thing.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.500]   And frankly, I think Mike has insights.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.820]   So, you know, these guys are pundits.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.420]   We're pundits.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.660]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.100]   Anyway, we'll get back to the conversation.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.820]   And I want to know why Nick Bilton thinks Apple should
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.140]   buy Sprint and how we can talk them into doing that.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:52.860]   But first--
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:53.460]   Say, please.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.100]   Pretty, pretty, please.
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.380]   Let's talk about carbonite.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.980]   It's backup done right.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.380]   Carbonite was created.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.260]   It's an interesting story.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.100]   David Friend, who created the ARPS synthesizers,
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.540]   it was kind of a serial entrepreneur.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.900]   He was enjoying the fruits of his leisure.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.980]   His daughter was in college.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.380]   She called home and said, "Taddy, I lost my term paper."
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.940]   And he thought, you know, I can't help her.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.380]   There's no-- she's got no backup.
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.100]   There must be a better way.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.140]   So he literally said, I'm going to invent something.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.020]   And he invented carbonite.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.420]   Kind of nice story because it goes full circle,
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.140]   because last year when my daughter headed the college
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.100]   as a freshman, of course, she went with a laptop
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.140]   and carbonite installed on it, because I
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.380]   didn't want to get that phone on the middle of the night.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.460]   Carbonite's cool because you put it on-- it's great for a laptop.
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.300]   You put it on, and it just starts backing up.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.940]   Whenever you're online, it's backing up.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:40.860]   Uses SSL.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.740]   So even if you're at an open access spot, it's completely secure,
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.700]   you can add your own encryption, by the way,
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.380]   strong encryption, so your privacy is guaranteed.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.020]   It's cloud storage.
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.660]   You know, this is cloud storage before anybody
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.380]   even really started talking about this.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.660]   You can log into your carbonite account on any computer,
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.900]   on your iPhone, your iPad, your Android phone, your BlackBerry,
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.700]   and there's your data.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.540]   So you don't even have to wait for a disaster.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.940]   But when disaster strikes, it's just peace of mind.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.220]   You know you can restore it.
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.820]   Seven billion files to date have been restored by carbonite.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.500]   Wow.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.860]   Seven billion.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.900]   For home or for office, try it for free right now.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.180]   Just go to carbonite.com.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.220]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.180]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.940]   And by the way, if you do decide to buy,
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:25.300]   use TWIT again because you'll get 14 months for the price
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.820]   of 12 to three months.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:30.220]   It's only $59 a year per computer for the home,
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.260]   for businesses because it's multi-computers
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.860]   in multiple locations, $229 a year.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.540]   It is really the best deal in backup out there.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.380]   And cloud storage.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.780]   You gotta back it up to get it back, so do it right.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.980]   With carbonite.
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.980]   Look, she's installing it right there, right there.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:46.860]   Let us move on.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.620]   All right, so.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.060]   Sprint's not for sale, we should point out.
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:53.300]   Although if AT&T acquired T-Mobile,
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:56.300]   Sprint would be so far behind, you'd almost have to sell, right?
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.060]   Sprint's not for sale, but it's got a market cap of $10.3 billion.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.380]   It was $60 billion.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.140]   The T-V very recently.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:03.660]   It's--
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.860]   You're looking too.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.940]   Over the last couple of months,
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.740]   its stock has dropped from--
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:11.060]   I mean, it's had a 52-week high of $6.45,
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.300]   and now it's at $3.45.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.740]   It's pretty bad.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.340]   And what they have--
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.180]   That's too bad because I love Sprint.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:18.940]   Sprint is great.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.260]   But what they have is an amazing data network.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:21.820]   Right.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.420]   They don't have a great voice network.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.020]   Who cares?
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.020]   Who uses a spell for voice?
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:28.740]   But the next generation of all these Mac products
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.820]   are going to have data in them.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:34.740]   And so if you purchase for $10 billion--
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.900]   let's just say they pay $15 million.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.660]   They still have $55 billion in the bank.
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.300]   It's like not that.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.220]   Apple, you're talking about it.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:41.540]   Yeah, Apple.
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.140]   Well, and the rumor is that Apple will offer the iPhone 5
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.620]   on Sprint, and that Sprint might offer an unlimited data
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.140]   plan, the last company.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.820]   And of course, you have to when you're the also ran.
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.420]   This is why I want to keep T-Mobile live,
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.540]   because being weak is good for consumers,
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.900]   because you have to entice them.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.580]   I'll tell you what, this is certainly
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:00.700]   super engaging for me, because I still
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.820]   have the unlimited plan on my iPhone 4.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.740]   I got grandfathered in.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.020]   Yeah, but you know, it's just a matter of time.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:05.860]   Well, and that's just it.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.780]   And in fact, the thing that kills me about it
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:08.540]   is that I'm limited.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.540]   I can never, never tether legally.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:12.580]   And of course, AT&T is now cracking down
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:13.700]   on people who tether.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:17.500]   I got one of those texts saying, ah, you're tethering bad boy.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.300]   And so I went a few months without it,
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.180]   but then I found myself on the way out to DragonCon.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.900]   I had to access some files.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:25.620]   And so I installed a PDA net on my jailbroken iPhone, which
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.100]   is supposed to have a disguise mode.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.940]   And it was 48 hours.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.380]   They nailed me again.
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.420]   And they're like, OK, seriously, you're busted.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.380]   And I was like, all right, well, you know,
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.020]   it's like if you convert me over to a tethering plan,
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.500]   then I'm going to go to another carrier,
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.460]   because what's the difference?
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.140]   The only reason I'm still here is for the unlimited.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:43.740]   You're talking to a representative for the point.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:44.740]   Yeah, yeah, AT&T.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.740]   Did he understand what you were saying?
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:46.940]   Oh, yeah, no, he knew exactly everything.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.340]   He's like, look, I see where you're coming from.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.740]   And it's obvious from your data usage
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.860]   that you needed unlimited plan.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:53.100]   If you want to keep the unlimited plan,
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.860]   this is for reals your last warning.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:56.700]   So now I'm on Redline Notice.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.860]   And I'll tell you, man, if they offered tethering on Sprint,
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:00.300]   I'd be over there so fast.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.100]   And I'm a 13-year subscriber to AT&T Wireless.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.140]   13 years you've had to deal with that relationship?
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:06.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.740]   Awful.
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:11.420]   You know, isn't the customer service equally bad,
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:11.940]   though, everywhere?
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:12.820]   I mean, they're all kind of--
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:14.940]   Well, Sprint, you know, I was going to Sprint's CEO.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:16.980]   And they really made an effort to try to--
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:19.220]   Because I left Sprint about 10 years ago,
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.540]   because they were really awful.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.300]   When he came back, that was the first thing he did.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:23.740]   He was like, I'm going to make customers--
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:25.740]   What's his name?
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:26.460]   I forget the--
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.500]   Dan Hesse?
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.060]   Oh, that's Guy.
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:29.340]   Yeah, the guy that does--
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:30.060]   It does all the ads.
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:31.980]   So they've had 16--
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:32.420]   It's really tall guy.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.580]   16 consecutive money losing quarters.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.500]   That's a lot.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.100]   15, sorry.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.260]   They're kind of--
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:42.740]   So back to the original point, you want them--
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.460]   you want Apple to buy them so that they can put data
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.140]   on all of their device and say, like--
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.660]   The data is going on all the devices.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.660]   That's not a question, right?
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.060]   If you look at some of the rumor sites and things like that,
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.420]   you can see next generation MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.020]   that have--
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:55.540]   3G.
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.060]   3G.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:56.580]   3G.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.580]   4G.
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:58.060]   Chip's built in.
[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.740]   This-- an air requires 3G.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:00.500]   Just big for 3G.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.020]   Everything does.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:01.820]   Everything does.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.940]   Well, and what are the things--
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.220]   Your freakin' refrigerator wants--
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.060]   So the question is, does Apple charge you for that?
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.180]   Is that just one more thing you have to pay for?
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.980]   Or when you start to look at competitors,
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.140]   you're going to try to get into this space.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.820]   And when you start to look at tablet competitors, which
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.980]   is the biggest deal for Apple right now,
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:20.420]   when Android-- when Amazon releases their carla tablet
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.220]   in the next couple of months, which they're going to do,
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.620]   it's going to have built in 3G.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.780]   You're not going to have to pay for it.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.980]   So here's the other thing is that if Sprint really
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.140]   does have the bandwidth, then Apple
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.900]   has the branding that would allow people to pay an outrageous
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.940]   amount for wireless coverage that just always works.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.300]   So here's the problem I have with the whole thing.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.300]   Sprint is just the US.
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.380]   The Apple is--
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.460]   And it's CDMA, which means it can only be the US.
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.100]   It can only be the US.
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.620]   Perching this, purchasing this thing
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.580]   doesn't really help them outside of the US.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.060]   And they're much bigger than just the US.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.860]   It doesn't solve the overall problem.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.340]   They would need a worldwide network.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:58.420]   And there's no acquisition they could make.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.460]   To do that, they would have to make five, six of them.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.060]   And that would cost 75 billion dollars.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.740]   Too bad they don't have enough money to buy Deutsche Telekom.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.820]   Then you'd have everything.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.820]   What's Deutsche Telekom worth?
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:08.580]   Do you have 200?
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.060]   Well, if T-Mobile's worth $39 billion,
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.380]   I think they're worth a lot of money.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.660]   But you don't have to be an all cash deal.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.500]   Apple stock has got some value.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.820]   Apple stock has got some tremendous--
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.300]   No, you don't have to say years of check.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.180]   You can work out it.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.420]   Well, I mean, AT&T has a market cap of 164 billion
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.460]   completely out of the question.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:28.700]   But I wouldn't buy AT&T if they were like 12 bucks.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.140]   I mean, no offense to AT&T.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:34.460]   But maybe the strategy is that they focus on the US
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:34.740]   for that.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.340]   And then they have a 3G chip that
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.140]   works across overseas or something like that.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:39.620]   I don't know.
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.620]   Well, there is a Qualcomm chip that's both CDMA and GSM.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.780]   The next chip that's going to be in the next iPhone.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.460]   Yeah, so the other problem with the strategy
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.540]   is if the partners will get pissed,
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.140]   and they'll just be like, we're not
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.660]   going to sell your iPhones once you sell it.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.780]   And that's--
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.300]   Oh, come on.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.380]   The partners are so pissed right now at a million things.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:57.900]   Apple's done it.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.700]   What about the--
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.300]   The tax messaging thing that's coming out?
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.300]   That is crossing-- the acquiring sprint
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.860]   would be crossing the line.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.300]   I swear to you, they're both--
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.460]   Can you turn your back on the iPhone, though,
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.060]   nowadays as a carrier?
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:09.900]   It's worth gold.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.380]   It's gold.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:10.980]   That's a gold.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.420]   Verizon survived forever without the iPhone.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.340]   They would survive with it.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:16.900]   They survived, but now they're happy.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.340]   Yeah, how long until--
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:22.060]   Do you want to just survive?
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:26.500]   Do you want to be at the whim of Apple if you are Verizon or AT&T?
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.340]   Hey, this is business.
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:28.260]   You're always-- there's--
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.300]   Terrible point.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.220]   Somebody once told me, because I said, I want to start my own company
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.860]   and said, I don't have to worry about the man.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.500]   And they said, somebody's always the man.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.620]   Someone's always the man.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.220]   Somebody's always the man.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.460]   You can't get away from it.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.460]   You're going to deal with somebody you hate no matter what.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.140]   Well, in that case, you start your own company.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.860]   That's the worst way to avoid dealing with a man,
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.420]   because every customer becomes a man.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.420]   So I found--
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.420]   Yes.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:49.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.340]   --all the freaking man.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:53.180]   I like the idea.
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.140]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.060]   I like the idea.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.220]   It's $15 billion.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.300]   It's nothing.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.900]   So here's the question is--
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.220]   You know what would be smart?
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.980]   Because Tim Cook would be in a way saying, hey, I'm a player.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.460]   It's different.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.620]   It's not just Steve Jobs.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.860]   I'm in this game.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.860]   That wouldn't hurt to have that.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.900]   You know what would be killer as an Apple device user
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.300]   is having some kind of unified data
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.380]   plan across my devices.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:15.860]   Oh, my god.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.700]   It would be amazing.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.500]   It's ridiculous how many different data plans I have right now.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.860]   Yeah, I agree completely.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:20.340]   So you're--
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.660]   And when they put 3G or 4G in my laptop, it's going to be--
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:23.860]   Yeah, it's like--
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:24.940]   You have another contract.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.380]   So now I've got an iPad contract.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.420]   I've got a phone contract.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:27.900]   Well, no.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.700]   Maybe my phone is also with Apple.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.460]   Well, and that's where hotspots nice,
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.260]   because if you have a hotspot, then you'll
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.660]   meet Wi-Fi on your devices, and you can use hotspot.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.780]   But that's another device you've got to carry around.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.620]   You've got to keep your--
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.260]   One on your phone.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:41.900]   No, don't see.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.020]   I have an Android phone that works as a hotspot.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:44.460]   Yes.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.020]   With T-Mobile.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.220]   I have a hotspot that's with Verizon,
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.020]   only because I want to make sure my AT&T phone fails.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.140]   I have Verizon's backup there.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.980]   Just none of the networks are reliable enough.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.180]   See, that's what you're missing, Ryan.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:58.980]   You need a hotspot.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.260]   Well, yes, I definitely do.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.460]   And that was one of the best part.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.060]   When I was traveling with OMG Chad,
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.540]   he had the Verizon smartphone.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.420]   And I had the Apple iPhone.
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.540]   So he would take turns.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.940]   That's why we tired him away from me.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:09.340]   I know.
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.260]   But now I've got John Tilton, who has another iPhone.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:11.780]   So now we're both--
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.660]   Damn you.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.820]   That's why I got the T-Mobile dongle.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.340]   So I'm like the only person in San Francisco using its great--
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.700]   It's a really good thing not to be an AT&T user
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.740]   in the e-barrierian.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.140]   I imagine there are other areas of the country
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:23.940]   where that's the case.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.740]   So supposedly it's 4G capable, which
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.540]   means 4G wants every month or so.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.540]   It means you never get it.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.540]   I'll tell you the real swing vote
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.420]   is the fact that now that I've got three devices
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:36.380]   between my phone, my laptop, and my iPad, it just makes sense.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.860]   It would be idiotic to set up all three
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:41.460]   on separate accounts and pay $150 or whatever for data.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.020]   Ladies and gentlemen, a picture of Sushi.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:45.740]   Yes.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.060]   This--
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.540]   I'm hungry again.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.020]   That's a luncheon, Apple.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:49.940]   We verified that.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.740]   Lots and lots of pixels of Sushi.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.460]   A lot of 8 megapixels worth of Sushi.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.340]   Although this is, by the way, we should say,
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.780]   this was unflicker briefly, made private, quickly.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.140]   Apple employee, an engineer--
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.140]   Longer works for the company.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.340]   Just kidding.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.540]   Yeah, well, that's curious.
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:05.340]   I wonder.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.620]   If you accidentally post a picture from an iPhone 5,
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.380]   if you get in trouble.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.300]   But the exit information was there.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:15.420]   People were able to verify this is a next generation iPhone.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:16.940]   Unless it's completely faked.
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:17.820]   Exit.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:20.060]   The exit information said the GPS location
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.740]   was at one infinite loop.
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:22.940]   I just have a quick question.
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:25.460]   Why do you think this person is eating vegetable rolls
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.140]   with all that wonderful fish?
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:27.980]   That's a good question.
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.900]   You've got the avocado roll and then the incredible salmon.
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:30.900]   What is it they offer at Apple?
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.900]   You're going to eat it.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:32.900]   You're going to eat it.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:33.900]   And what is that thing on the upper left?
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.900]   Is that-- that doesn't look good.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.900]   That looks like hummus.
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:36.900]   Yeah, right.
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:37.900]   It looks like--
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.900]   Is it hummus?
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:39.900]   Hummus?
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:40.900]   Sushi.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.900]   It's like Tim Cook's leftover lunch.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:42.900]   It's like sea urchin.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:43.900]   That's sea urchin?
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:44.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:45.900]   Tobiko?
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.900]   No.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:47.900]   Ooni.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.900]   Ooni.
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.900]   Ooni.
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.900]   Did we really just get distracted talking about fish?
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.900]   Is that what just happened?
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.900]   That's the name of the fish.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:55.900]   Ooni.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.900]   Oh.
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.900]   There we go.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.900]   We've got the--
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.900]   You need more random facts.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.900]   I can't see the CEO of Sprint.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.900]   The name of that random.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:10.900]   So there was considerable ridiculous amount of parsing of the-- of this data from ours,
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.900]   Technica, and others.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:18.100]   And it's pretty clear that it is either a Sony 8 megapixel sensor or an 8 megapixel sensor
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.900]   from another company that Apple uses called Omnivision.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.900]   That the-- that's because even though it was a cropped picture, that the full-- the XF showed
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:31.900]   that the final dimensions, the big dimensions, would in fact be 8 megapixel.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.900]   Yeah, I don't know do we care.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.900]   Well, I mean, I'll tell you what, I care about--
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:36.900]   Esoteric Industry or what?
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:37.900]   I mean--
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.900]   Oh, Esoteric.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:42.900]   You know, it's going to be F2.4, whereas the maximum aperture of the iPhone 4 is F2.8.
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:47.900]   The reality is there's a lot more people sitting at home looking at Flickr XF data than like
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:50.900]   going to China and looking at what's actually mean for this.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.900]   That's the amazing part, right?
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.900]   Well, I'll tell you the one thing I noticed about this picture is that there's no giant
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.900]   blue dot, which I can't believe still is every single photo you take in fluorescent light.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:06:59.900]   You did--
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.900]   You did a giant blue dot?
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.900]   The giant blue discoloration in the center of all the iPhone pictures.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:03.900]   Have you not noticed this?
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:04.900]   No.
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:05.900]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.900]   I think there's something wrong with it.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:07.900]   That avocado doesn't look very fresh actually.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.900]   Not much.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:09.900]   Not much.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.900]   You know what's close to defending your iPhone?
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.900]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:15.900]   I know that this is in fact not an Apple lunch because that avocado wouldn't be much fresher
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:16.900]   for them.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.900]   Steve Jobs hand selects each avocado for the sushi.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:28.900]   So this is actually a big deal of a story though because we have heard that the next iPhone
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.900]   from the CEO of Sony who actually--
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.900]   You said it's used as our best image sensor.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.900]   It's going to be a megapixel.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:40.900]   But I think it's a big deal for the camera companies that are losing customers quicker
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:45.900]   than camera phones are just-- that's just when a place point--
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:50.900]   There's always going to be a small place for the high super quality cameras.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.900]   Most people are turning to their phones because they can take the picture and then they can send it to the friends.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.900]   I have anecdotal evidence.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:08:00.900]   It's really fun because I've been posing for pictures with fans since 1998.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:06.900]   So when it first started everybody would come to the events with a disposable camera with film in it.
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:12.900]   And then I remember very well when the Sony Mavica came out because you'd have to wait and wait and wait.
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.900]   And then because it was saving to a floppy disk.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:16.900]   What?
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.900]   Oh yeah, no, I totally remember that.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.900]   What's a floppy disk?
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.900]   Liz is baffled by this.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.900]   The saving to a what?
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.900]   I'm not young enough for you.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.900]   A floppy disk.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.900]   And then I remember that the batteries would die.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:32.900]   And so everybody would come up and say, oh, the batteries did for like two years.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.900]   And then I remember when it-- but now it's camera phones.
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.900]   It's almost universally camera phones.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.900]   Very few people now bring point and shoot cameras.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:43.900]   This is the same thing we're seeing in the video game market where for casual gaming you're not carrying around an Nintendo DS anymore.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.900]   You just whip out the camera phone.
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.900]   And it's not as good. The smartphone experience is not as good as your desktop.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:51.900]   This is a fluffy photo right here.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.900]   It's a benefit of Liz's.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.900]   This is what we used, you know, back in 2001.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:58.900]   You know, Liz? You know how much-- okay, this is good.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:02.900]   Take a guess how much data you can store on that.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:03.900]   Any idea?
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:04.900]   What is it, what, one point?
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900]   Shh!
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900]   It's in my gun!
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.900]   I'm putting cling on my whole jigalaba!
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.900]   That's Klingon.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.900]   That's it.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.900]   For shut up.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.900]   Now they're saying the chat room. That's 1.44 megabytes.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:20.900]   Megabytes? That's less than-- I mean a gigabyte.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:25.900]   Well, I couldn't fix one image from my camera on 12 of these.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:26.900]   Oh, easily, yeah.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.900]   Okay.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:28.900]   But have your own--
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.900]   I've got those things.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.900]   Have your own stack.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.900]   Apparently this is Adobe Illustrator 6.0, the installer.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.900]   Oh man.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:34.900]   Adobe Illustrator 6.0.
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:37.900]   You get a floppy and you get a floppy.
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:39.900]   Everybody gets a floppy.
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:40.900]   Hand those out.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:41.900]   Thank you.
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:45.900]   I'm G-Chad showing once again how valuable that acquisition has been from--
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:46.900]   Leo, you haven't even--
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.900]   You haven't even read it yet, aren't you, Leo?
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.900]   Wow.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.900]   Do you have any whiskey, Leo?
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:52.900]   Yeah, where's the McCallen, Chad, you know?
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.900]   That's actually the only reason I came up here.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.900]   I drove from San Francisco.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.900]   I think it's in my office, isn't it?
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.900]   Look, there's a cask strength.
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:00.900]   Go ahead and get that out because I think that--
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.900]   I need something to go with my chocolate M&M's.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:03.900]   It's disgusting.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.900]   What kind of peanuts are in those?
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.900]   They're--
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:07.900]   What kind of peanuts?
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.900]   What kind of peanuts?
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.900]   They're American peanut butter.
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:11.900]   What kind of peanuts?
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.900]   Well, I believe this would be--
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.900]   According to the ex-if information.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.900]   No, the new M&M's, which we--
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.900]   I think we consumed entirely have pretzels inside.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.900]   Have you heard of those?
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.900]   That sounds good.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.900]   Really excellent.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:28.900]   You know, I'm just going to take a break because obviously we're going to take an M&M break.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:33.900]   We invite you at home to take an M&M break with us while we talk a little bit about Audible.com.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.900]   Show of hands, audio book listeners.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.900]   Come on.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.900]   Oh, yeah, look at that.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.900]   This is great.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.900]   In fact, you know what?
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.900]   This adds no longer going to be worth anything.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.900]   No!
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:43.900]   Because--
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.900]   Because I've got to--
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.900]   But I know the book everyone's going to be reading this here.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.900]   But are there people at home who are not yet Audible members?
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:49.900]   Uh, yes.
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:50.900]   What's the book then?
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:51.900]   What?
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900]   No, no, no.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.900]   Here's who they are.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:54.900]   And to be honest, I'm not going to lie.
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.900]   I'm one of them.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:59.900]   I keep telling myself I'm not going to read so many books and I don't sign up for the regular playing.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.900]   So you know who's not showing?
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:01.900]   I know.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:02.900]   I still buy them.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.900]   No, no, no, don't go.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.900]   I waste so much money.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:05.900]   Yeah, don't go on the car.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:09.900]   I joined just a few weeks ago and my car trips are so much better now.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:10.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.900]   I like working out as better.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:13.900]   Everything is better.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   Sex is better.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.900]   I don't want audiobook.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.900]   You're listening to it.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.900]   You've been married as long as I have.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.900]   Wait, you listen to the audiobook during sex or is this--
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.900]   Is that what makes it better?
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.900]   Let's just tell you that came out of this.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.900]   It's for awkward moments when you burst out laughing.
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:32.900]   Ten percent of women?
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:37.900]   I thought it was 100 percent.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.900]   It depends what audiobook girl is.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.900]   Hang on with the wrong women.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:44.900]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.900]   No, I'm not going to go in it.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.900]   I'm not going to go there, but there is in fact a--
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.900]   Well, there's some more.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   No, they have erotic pictures.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.900]   They have erotic pictures.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.900]   I wasn't what I was--
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:58.900]   I was scrolling faster than I thought.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:11:59.900]   I know.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.900]   It's kind of a little excited in me.
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900]   No, I'm not.
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:03.900]   What is sex?
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900]   I've never heard of this before.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.900]   I've heard of girls, but not this other thing.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.900]   What is that?
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.900]   What does that have to do with an 8 megapixel camera?
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.900]   You could get in bed with Susie Bright.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.900]   It's actually a really good, kind of a podcast, but they have it on.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.900]   You know, if you subscribe to Audible, this is another reason to subscribe, Brian.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.900]   You also get the Wall Street Journal of the New York Times.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:23.900]   For freezies?
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:24.900]   For freezies every day.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.900]   Are we dead?
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.900]   Dude.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:27.900]   They get an audio version of it.
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:28.900]   Wow.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:29.900]   So Nick built in said--
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:30.900]   Wow.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:31.900]   It's a human read, actually.
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:32.900]   I know, it's a human read.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:33.900]   Yeah, it's really quite good.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.900]   But he sounds exactly like that.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:36.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:37.900]   Sounds like he's from France.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:38.900]   So here's what you do.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.900]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.900]   Now, this is a special place where you sign up for the platinum account.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.900]   That's two books a month.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.900]   Good.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.400]   And your first month is free.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400]   Your first two books is free.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.900]   So this is a way to get two books free.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:51.900]   So Brian, give us a book that we could all--
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:52.900]   Let's check this out.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:55.900]   Look up Ready Player One by Ernest Kleine.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.500]   It's read by Will Wheaton.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:58.900]   Some people remember Ernest Kleine.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:01.900]   He's the guy who wrote the fanboys movie.
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.900]   And it takes place in this--
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.900]   Can you say Will Wheaton?
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:09.900]   Cool whip.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.900]   Whip.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:11.900]   You guys remember that right there?
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:12.900]   Fire.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.900]   Yeah, you gotta pull that up.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:15.900]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   That's all I have.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.900]   I will.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.900]   So check this out.
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:24.100]   This takes place like 50 years in the future and you got this crazy character who dies with
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.900]   pretty much the richest man, $250 billion.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.900]   He leaves his fortune in an Easter egg in a virtual online world.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.900]   You're kidding.
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.900]   And because this guy is obsessed--
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.900]   So this would be a logical successor to maybe Daniel Suarez's freedom and demon.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.900]   Right.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   Because it's kind of that same idea.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:40.900]   Well, and here's the hook that's going to make this thing.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.900]   This is the Geeks Da Vinci Code.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:47.900]   Everyone's going to be talking about it because this character died and he was always obsessed
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.900]   with 1980s geek culture.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:54.900]   Then all of a sudden the whole world becomes obsessed with 1980s geek culture so that they can try to
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:55.900]   decode where his Easter egg is.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:01.900]   So as a result you have these bizarre mashups where you have Dungeons, Dragons playing joust
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.900]   against while flying around and X-wing fighters.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.900]   I mean, it is so visual.
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.900]   It reminds me the last time I remember having a book that took me on such an outrageous ride
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.900]   was probably the original Snow Crash from Neil Stevens.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:14.900]   Oh, I love Snow--
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.900]   You know, Neil Stevens has a new book coming out, by the way.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.900]   My book comes out in paperback in a couple of weeks.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.900]   Oh, you know, your book is on here too, Nick.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.900]   Okay, so book one, Ready Player One.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:25.900]   Yes.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.900]   And book two, Nick Pilton's book, which is really great about living in the future.
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:30.900]   Yes, thank you.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:31.900]   I did read it.
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.900]   I live in the future and here's how it works.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.900]   Why your world, work and brain are being creatively disruptive.
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.900]   This is actually a really great book, Nick.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:40.900]   You did a great job.
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:41.900]   I appreciate it.
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:44.900]   So paperback coming out, but you can also get it for audio.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.900]   So this is one of your two books, Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.900]   There's actually so much stuff.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.900]   It's really challenging.
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.900]   The reason that we give you a picture is because there's 75,000 choices at Audible.
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.900]   So many great books.
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:57.900]   75,000?
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:58.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:14:59.900]   It's amazing.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.900]   I mean, that's just audiobooks.
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.900]   They have radio shows, comedy, performances.
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:10.140]   I just-- my next lesson is-- I have actually a section called "My Next Listen" is Neil
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:13.900]   Gaiman's "They Do A Dramatization of American Gods."
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:14.900]   I cannot wait.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:15.900]   Oh, wow.
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:17.900]   It's a full cast production.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:18.900]   That's awesome.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:19.900]   They ask it out.
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:20.900]   I think they knew that they're doing it.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:24.900]   I love-- instead of just a reader reading it, which is actually really good, because these
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.700]   readers are the greatest, they also will dramatize this stuff.
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:33.340]   So this is a 10th anniversary production of American Gods, which is a wonderful book.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.900]   You know about the HBO project based on American Gods.
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:36.900]   No, that's their next franchise.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:37.900]   They're doing an HBO?
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:41.420]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, he's writing more material because American Gods isn't going
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.820]   to be enough to survive so many seasons.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.620]   I have to say, though, read the book first always.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.620]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.500]   Read Game of Thrones first, always, because you want to read the book and then watch the
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.500]   show the other way around.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.500]   Absolutely.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.500]   I just tweeted at you.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:53.500]   You tweeted at me.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:54.500]   I tweeted at you.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.500]   You should check that tweet and click on that link and turn on the audio.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.500]   All right.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.500]   Turn on the audio, ladies and gentlemen, because-- thank you, by the way, audible.com/twit2.

[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.820]   Two books waiting for you now.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:23.140]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Cool Whip.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.140]   Hey, new Brian.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.900]   Oh, I see you're having pie.
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:30.140]   You know, pie isn't really pie without Cool Whip.
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:31.300]   Everything's better with Cool Whip.
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.300]   Oh, this is the--
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.300]   No, this is the second one.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.300]   No, second one.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:35.300]   Yeah, what about it?
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.300]   It doesn't bother you the way I pronounce it.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.300]   Cool Whip.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.300]   No.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.460]   So I have to go back because that's referring back to a previous episode.
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:46.460]   That's the secondary episode with the second Brian, where he's replaced.
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.780]   You really have to be a fan of this show.
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:51.180]   I think it's the greatest show in the entire entire world.
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.580]   Or on the internet, as they say.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:54.580]   I think this is it.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.580]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.340]   Let's check it out here.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.340]   Mm-hmm.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.500]   Oh, this is--
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.500]   Oh, Cool Whip.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:02.500]   My name is Brian.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.540]   That was a good time to ask you if Chad ever found that whisper.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.540]   Hey, Brian.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.540]   Oh, Meg, hey.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.540]   Is this it?
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:10.540]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.020]   Hey, listen, I hope you're feeling all right about our little talk the other day.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.140]   You know, about us being just friends and all.
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.140]   No, I'm fine.
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:20.460]   And hey, look, I want to thank you for being so great to me.
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:22.260]   So I baked your pie.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.260]   Oh, wow.
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.260]   Hey, that looks delicious.
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.260]   Where's the whiskey?
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.260]   Well, there's some--
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.260]   Yeah, where's the whiskey?
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.700]   Well, there's some apples and some cinnamon.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.260]   This is such a long setup.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.260]   My hair.
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.260]   What?
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.260]   My hair is in the pie, Brian.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.260]   And now it's inside of here.
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:36.260]   Well, this is when they fell in love.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.260]   Well, she fell in love with Brian.
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.260]   Do we find another Ron clip?
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:40.260]   Yeah, we're just wrong.
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:41.260]   Do you feel me, Brian?
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.260]   Do you feel me?
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:44.260]   Do you feel me?
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:45.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.260]   Are you going to get some cool whiskey?
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.260]   Yes.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.260]   You lost your whiskey.
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:50.260]   Oh, you got some pie.
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:51.260]   I'm going to use Leo.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:52.260]   Oh, here it is.
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:53.260]   Here it is.
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:54.260]   This is it.
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.260]   Right here.
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:56.260]   Cool whip.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:57.260]   What did you say?
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.260]   You called it a pie without cool whip.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.260]   Cool whip.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.260]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:03.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:05.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.260]   You're saying it weird.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:07.260]   Why are you putting so much emphasis on the H?
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.260]   What are you talking about?
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:09.260]   I'm just saying it.
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:10.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.260]   What are you talking about?
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.260]   Pie tastes better with cool whip.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.260]   Say whip.
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:14.260]   Whip.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.260]   Cool whip.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.260]   You're eating hair.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:20.260]   No.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.260]   I have returned.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:22.260]   Did we drink it?
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.260]   Hey, there you go.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.260]   It's called McAllen Whiskey.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.260]   Whiskey.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:31.260]   I don't think maybe we drank the McAllen at the time.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.260]   What?
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.260]   Whoa.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.260]   What do you got, old man, G-Chad?
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.260]   I have some Balvaney.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.260]   What the hell is that?
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:40.260]   What is this?
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:41.260]   Richters.
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.260]   Well, whiskey.
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.260]   There's Balvaney.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.260]   Somewhere there's Balvaney.
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.260]   All right, I'll try this one.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:47.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:49.260]   Is this one you'll say whatever it's not?
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.260]   It's not much either.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:51.260]   Hey, Scrapp.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.260]   You want a beach?
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.260]   All right.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.260]   That looks good.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.260]   This interval brought to you by Cool Whip and Whiskey.
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.260]   Anybody wants a week to do it?
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:59.260]   All right, Googlebot Zagat.
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:00.260]   What was that all about?
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.260]   Yay.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:02.260]   Question?
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.260]   I don't know if it's a yay.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:07.260]   It's a yay for Nina and there's a gap, people, who made $125 million.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.260]   We're going to ask you.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.260]   Do you drink it neat?
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:15.260]   Would you like an ice cube with empanines?
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:16.260]   You have an egg?
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.260]   A round peanut.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.260]   I doubled on it.
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.260]   Don't you think?
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:20.260]   No, I never thought about that.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.260]   But how do they make those so round?
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.260]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.260]   They're like special peanuts.
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.260]   I think they're GMO.
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.260]   Did you say you have more coming?
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.260]   Because we're almost out here.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:27.260]   I don't want any.
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.260]   That's all right.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.260]   Give it to Ben.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:30.260]   Somebody has to stay sober.
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.260]   I'll wait for the next one.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.260]   I'm not driving.
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.260]   I'm driving the show.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.260]   The Balvaney will be good.
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.260]   If we can find the Balvaney, that's very good.
[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:40.260]   It's in its box still.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.260]   Oh, it's still in its box.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.260]   I think it was just an earthquake.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.260]   2.4.
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.260]   Really?
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.260]   Here?
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.260]   Somewhere in California.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:48.260]   If we didn't drink so much, I think we'd do a Vanogh.
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.260]   I'll have a Santa Jose.
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:50.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.260]   It's just down the road.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:53.260]   I'm still waiting to experience my first earthquake.
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.260]   No, I just have to experience what you did.
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.260]   Ever experience an earthquake?
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:56.260]   No, no, no, no.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:57.260]   Ever experienced an earthquake?
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.260]   That last one.
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.260]   The one after the new one.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:01.260]   Does it count?
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.260]   Ever experienced a real earthquake?
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:04.260]   No.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:06.260]   Wait, how long did you live here?
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.260]   Oh, no.
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.260]   I wasn't here in '89.
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:09.260]   I remember--
[01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:10.260]   Sweetie.
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:11.260]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.260]   It's Cask Strength McAllen.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.260]   Oh, my God.
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.260]   I just went to check it down in the drink bath.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:15.260]   Yes.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.260]   I didn't think we'd drink it all.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.260]   Is it Palakplenzi?
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.260]   No.
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.260]   I remember 1989.
[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:23.260]   Wait, so that was your great earthquake.
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.260]   I spent the year in New Jersey, so I missed that one.
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.260]   You missed it?
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.260]   I did.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.260]   That's kind of a secret.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.260]   No, wait till you have a real earthquake.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.260]   You'll stop drinking whiskey.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:32.260]   I'll tell you that right now.
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:35.260]   It's because you don't expect the floor to move, right?
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.260]   You kind of feel like this should be solid, and it's not.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.260]   What do you feel?
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.260]   Everything moves?
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.260]   Everything you feel like the world is like--
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.260]   Ben?
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.260]   Leo?
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.260]   No, all right.
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.260]   Yeah, I'll have some of that.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.260]   That's good stuff.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.260]   You guys could drink that other crap.
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.260]   So I have a question.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:55.260]   Now, Leo, if you were one of the CEOs of Google, would you buy as a gap?
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.260]   Yes.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.260]   Remember now, I'll tell you why.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.260]   Remember, Google tried to buy Yelp, was--
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.260]   Brubuffed.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.260]   Spurned.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.260]   Correct.
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:03.260]   Google tried to buy Groupon.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.260]   Thank God they were spurned on that one.
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:08.260]   Because I think Groupon may have been a little bit of a pyramid scheme.
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:10.260]   Six billion dollars they offered for Groupon.
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:13.260]   What was the one worth like now, like $12, right?
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.260]   I don't know.
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:20.260]   They keep putting off the IPO because, well, the Wall Street, the bus markets down, I think
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:24.260]   that there's some real issue about Groupon's actual worth.
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:25.260]   Correct.
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:29.260]   Well, there's a fantastic Wired article talking about what a bum deal Groupon was for the people
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.260]   actually doing it.
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:33.260]   And it's like they basically restated the exact Groupon model, but in reverse order, and
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:37.260]   it just sounded like the most ridiculous, like, who on earth would ever sign up for that?
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:42.260]   This entire acquisition, it has all the classic characteristics of Mercer Meyer acquisition.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:43.260]   Like, Mercer wrote the book--
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:45.260]   I like to get, so I'm going to buy it.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.260]   She definitely--
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:47.260]   That was very sexist to me.
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:48.260]   Okay.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.260]   She wrote a haiku.
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.260]   She did?
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.260]   A haiku for the acquisition.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:54.260]   You got to find it.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.260]   Oh, dear.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.260]   It's tweeted.
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.260]   All right, find the haiku.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.260]   Why wasn't a goopled question?
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.260]   Here's why, strategically, I think it's a good idea.
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.260]   Why?
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.260]   Why did they get Yelp?
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:05.260]   And when they couldn't get Yelp, they created Hot Pot, remember?
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.260]   Right.
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.260]   Not much traction.
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:08.260]   Correct.
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:13.260]   What Google really wants and where the big cache, of course, is for is if you start using
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:18.460]   Google to find places to eat, and perhaps-- and there's some concern from an open table
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:21.940]   that Google might even do a reservation system built around this.
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:28.060]   There's a lot of money for Google in that kind of local search.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:32.060]   But the problem is right now that Google can create something like places in Hot Pot,
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:35.420]   and it's got no traction, because we've got other things to use.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.420]   We already use a GAT.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:37.420]   I use a GAT a lot.
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.420]   Do you think they're buying the names of GAT?
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.940]   When I was in Paris for a little web, I was in a hotel.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.340]   I was saying, well, is there anything good here?
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:46.380]   A GAT has it, and you just go there.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.460]   I use a GAT in every town that they're in.
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:51.180]   I think that what this does is it gives them some credibility.
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:56.780]   It gives them a brand for Hot Pot or places, and then makes their local search relevant
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:57.780]   and valuable.
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:00.780]   And then, $125 million, that's a deal.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:01.780]   That's nothing.
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:02.780]   That's interesting.
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:03.780]   Yeah, especially for Google.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:07.700]   And they get an instant foothold into a space they want to get into.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:08.700]   So they bought the brand.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.020]   They didn't buy the functionality.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:11.020]   They didn't buy the reviews.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.020]   They bought the brand.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.500]   And I think it's a damn good brand, don't you?
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.500]   I think it's a very good brand.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.820]   I actually think this is a good acquisition on their part.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:20.500]   They couldn't get Yelp, but this gives them--
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.060]   It's better than Yelp.
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.700]   Yeah, very, very credible.
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.140]   And there's a lot of ways they can integrate that.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.620]   I don't remember what they were offering for Yelp.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.860]   No, because it's like old school user generated content, right?
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:32.100]   It was a book.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:37.300]   But there's all these new and emerging interesting restaurant review and recommendation apps,
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:38.300]   right?
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:42.100]   There's all these people who are trying to apply data mining to or collaborative filtering
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:46.620]   or whatever it's going to be to figure out how can we find you a better restaurant than
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:47.920]   Yelp can find you.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.220]   But Zagat is a trusted source.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:51.860]   But Zagat is more, I think, just the listing, right?
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.860]   It's the canonical.
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:53.860]   This is exactly what you can expect.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.420]   Oh, it's more than the listing.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:56.420]   They have reviews.
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:59.500]   Well, they have the reviews, but it's exactly what you're saying.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.940]   It gives an air of credibility to it.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:06.220]   Because there's so many-- when you look at places, often you don't get what you're looking
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.220]   for.
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.220]   You get bad information.
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:09.220]   Do you--
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.580]   It's a trusted name the way a photo is for international traffic.
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:12.580]   They can't say it.
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.740]   Do you use Zagat's on your phone?
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:14.740]   Mm-hmm.
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:15.740]   Oh, see, I do.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740]   Do you?
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.740]   I don't.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:18.740]   Oh, maybe that's why you guys are confused.
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:19.740]   I use four square.
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:20.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.740]   I do.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:25.180]   I really don't care what dens things is a good restaurant may have had.
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:29.060]   OK, so there's some really cool features to four square in, like, with the Explorer.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:33.900]   And I'm friends with Dennis, so I should probably preface that so people don't write a blog post
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.420]   about me or something.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:39.780]   But, like, so the Explorer here, you can-- there's like these neat little features where you
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:41.780]   can literally type in Thursday and explore.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:44.660]   And it'll tell you all these really cool things that are going on Thursdays in the
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.900]   area that you're in.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:47.860]   And I feel like it's more--
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:51.580]   I used Zagat the other day I was out in the inner sunset.
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:53.260]   And I wanted a good Italian restaurant.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:59.140]   So I did this on the phone, but of course you could do this on the website, too.
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:00.140]   Well, that's not good.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:02.140]   Oh!
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.140]   Sorry.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.140]   Sorry.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.140]   It's really--
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.100]   Why did he restaurant in San Francisco?
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.300]   That's not the result I was looking for.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.300]   Aw.
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.140]   Who bought them how long ago?
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.140]   What the hell?
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.140]   The app cost $10.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.780]   I have to buy something for $10 when I can earn it.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:18.780]   Zagat app is $10.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.780]   Yeah, I just looked it up.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.580]   All right, Google, you guys better give that away for free.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.580]   Oh, they will.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:23.580]   But that's what I'm saying.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:27.580]   It's not relevant to the current discussion about restaurants, so maybe it was a good
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:28.580]   surprise.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:31.180]   So because I haven't paid here, I'm not seeing the full information, but you'll get a score
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.980]   from 1 to 30 on food, decor, service, and cost.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:37.580]   It's very accurate, very accurate.
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:43.020]   And you can rank via food, and you will get great results, particularly in areas like
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:46.420]   New York, San Francisco, where the reviewers-- because it's real people.
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:47.580]   Oh, I know it's real people.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:48.580]   --are reliable.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.420]   But it's like, how do they do their data mining?
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:53.620]   Do they just have a pull box at each location after you finish your meeting?
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:54.620]   No, no, no, no.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.620]   You have to.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.300]   No, this is where Zagat is a brand that's so valuable.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:01.980]   Is you, as a Zagat user, will go to the web?
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:03.940]   Or yes, you're right, or fill out a form.
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.900]   You'll have-- if you have the book, because he started in these long, red books that
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:07.900]   everybody bought.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:08.900]   Number books?
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:09.900]   Yeah, number books?
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:10.900]   Number books?
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:11.900]   Nope, number two.
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:15.100]   Zagat is a brand that made the transition to the web and to the smartphone quite well, actually.
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.100]   Yes, they did do a good job.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.180]   And they did charge $10.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.700]   And it was worth it.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:22.300]   And once you buy it, you'll realize it really is the way to go, not Yelp.
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.820]   Because the problem with Yelp, Hot Pot, even 4-square.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.620]   Have you made the ones like mess or not?
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:29.620]   And that's--
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:30.620]   No, and four--
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.620]   There's a lot of them.
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:32.620]   What is it?
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.620]   Food spotting.
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.620]   Food spotting.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.580]   The problem with those is the reviews are spotty.
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:38.580]   They're all over the place.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:39.580]   You don't know.
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:42.060]   For some reason, the Zagat reviews are reliable and trustworthy.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.420]   So I think that this is the brand, and I think it's a smart brand to buy.
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.420]   It is.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:47.420]   It's the photos of food.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:48.420]   It's something in the middle, right?
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.540]   I mean, as much as I want a review to tell me what is good, I also want my friends to
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.540]   tell me what is good.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.340]   But cool, we can do that, can't they?
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:56.860]   Well, that's hopefully what they'll do.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.860]   That was Yelp, and there's flaws with Yelp, right?
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.420]   There are many flaws with Yelp.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:02.420]   Oh, there's--
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:03.420]   But they're great.
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:04.420]   They still do pretty well.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.780]   I mean, Yelp is still my go-to, absolutely.
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:07.860]   Really interesting.
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:10.260]   How about something like Angie's List?
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.260]   Does anybody ever use that?
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.500]   Also something you have to pay for, right?
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.500]   Yep, not free.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.220]   Why would I pay for things?
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:20.860]   Because unlike Yelp, where anybody, including a competitor, can put a review with Angie's
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.460]   List, those are-- you're not anonymous.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:23.540]   These are-- and same with Zagat.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.860]   They're not anonymous reviews.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:25.860]   And I think that that's what makes a difference.
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.660]   Yeah, I just don't feel like it's that high stakes of a decision to decide where to go
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:29.900]   to dinner and what to order.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:31.780]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:35.980]   What I actually do a lot is I search Twitter and Facebook to see what people are saying.
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:39.060]   So like when I'm in San Francisco and I want a good burger, I'll go to Twitter search
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:41.020]   and I'll say SF, good burger.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.820]   And I kind of start to see what people have--
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.740]   That's probably a more sophisticated role.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.580]   Your own technique than most people are going to use, right?
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.580]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.580]   Yeah.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.580]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.580]   I think you got it backwards.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:51.820]   I think you just ask everyone, just shout, "Hey, I'm in San Francisco.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:52.820]   Where should I go?"
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.460]   Or look at the table next to you and see what they were doing.
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:56.620]   I actually did that in Buenos Aires.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:57.620]   Buenos Aires?
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.620]   I was a Puerto Rican.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:27:59.620]   How is Buenos Aires?
[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:00.620]   Did you go to Barcelona, too?
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.620]   I thought I was a Puerto Rican.
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:02.620]   Buenos Aires.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.860]   When I was in Puerto Aires, I tweeted, "The time I'm on the way in Puerto Aires."
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:09.020]   That's where I go, and they gave me a place to go.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.620]   And then I tweeted, "I'm going to be there."
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:11.820]   And six people showed up.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.480]   And we had dinner together.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:15.500]   So it actually was a great experience.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.700]   It was one of the most memorable experiences I've ever had because A.I.
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:22.140]   found a great restaurant in a giant city via Twitter.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.180]   And then I met people, which was really fantastic.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.180]   That's fantastic.
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:29.060]   That's something, though, again, like what you do that is I think most people don't have
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.820]   the skill set or the desire to do that.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:31.820]   Or the Twitter follow.
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:32.820]   It's just the...
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:33.820]   Well, or the Twitter follow.
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:34.820]   No, but you don't...
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.420]   I'm not just searching my Twitter followers.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:37.420]   I'm searching Twitter.
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.420]   Oh, I am.
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:39.420]   Yes.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:40.420]   You hear that?
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.660]   If you're not following Leo, you're dead to him.
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:43.660]   You're dead to me.
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:46.160]   Well, I'll let you go from Bratalana.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.160]   This is weird.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.400]   This is a Google+ post from a couple of days ago.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.520]   Yeah, talking about Easter eggs, right?
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:58.520]   Andy Arnt, who's a software engineer at Google, said that Bing has a couple of Easter egg search
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.520]   queries.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.640]   If you search for more evil than Satan himself...
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.360]   And first of all, the setup for this would be like that's what everyone called Microsoft,
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.520]   more evil than Satan himself.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:12.120]   It was at some point, if you did a search, then Microsoft came up as the number one thing.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:18.060]   So their rebuttal to that is now on Bing, if you type in more evil than Satan himself,
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.060]   you get, well, I guess...
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:22.300]   Now you get the story, which is great.
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:24.460]   But for a while, you would get 10 to the 100s.
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:25.460]   Which of course is?
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.460]   Of course is.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:27.460]   A Google.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.120]   Oh, I didn't get that right away.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.120]   I'm slow.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.120]   I didn't do well in that.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.120]   Well, and that's what I like.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.040]   I actually think, look, if you're going to be petty and act like you're a sophomore in high
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.080]   school, at least be classy and clever with your jokes.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.660]   Which I actually like this other one even better.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:48.340]   The other query as an Easter egg is, "H-A-Y-B-B-P-R-Q-A-G."
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.740]   Hibippikurag.
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:50.740]   That's the fake word.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:51.740]   That's the Bing sting.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:52.740]   That's right.
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.940]   That's the fake word that Google made up to see if Bing was copying or search results
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:56.940]   or not.
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:59.180]   And then once this started showing up, they're like, "Ah ha!
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:00.340]   We nabbed ya, Bing."
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:05.740]   And so, thinking that it's petty and whiny responded with, now when you search for that
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:10.380]   word, it shows up as a translation that the word is orcish.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:11.380]   It's orcish.
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:12.380]   It's minor.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:13.380]   Let's see if that's still working.
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:15.020]   By the way, Stephen Colbert apparently.
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:16.420]   No, they took it out.
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:17.420]   They took it out.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:19.420]   It was going to happen.
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:20.420]   I'd like to see more of this.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:21.420]   I think so.
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:22.420]   Let them fight.
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:23.420]   Yeah, no, I see it.
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:24.420]   I see it.
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:25.420]   I see it.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.420]   Look, and in fact, if you're Bing, you row with it and say, "That's right.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:28.420]   Those are the first two of 8,000 Easter eggs.
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:29.420]   Have a good time."
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.420]   Right on.
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:33.620]   Search all you want will make more.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:34.620]   I think you're right.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.620]   I think that's great.
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:38.100]   I mean, does anybody like, "Well, I'm not using Bing anymore.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.100]   That's too petty."
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:43.140]   No, you know a bunch of energy users are high-fiving each other when that came.
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:44.300]   Oh, totally.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:49.180]   It makes me want to use Bing more.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.020]   Twitter and Bing renew their social search partnership.
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:52.180]   Okay, we knew about that.
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:56.220]   Twitter is suing Twitad because they use the word tweet in their slogan.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:58.260]   Yeah, that's weird.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.180]   But apparently Twitter has a trademark on tweet.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:01.700]   Well, but they're late to get it.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:05.020]   Like everyone else, all the third party apps got it before they did.
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.020]   Isn't that weird?
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:09.300]   They trademarked Twit.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.300]   Is that why they call them tweets?
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:12.300]   Because they can't call them Twits.
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:16.540]   I don't know, because we have the trademarks four years before Twitter got it's trademark.
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:19.100]   I think because people think that we copied Twitter.
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:20.380]   That always gripes me.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:21.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:22.380]   We didn't.
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:26.860]   But like if you had the copyright, if you had the trademark, then I mean, Twitter has
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.460]   climbed uphill shouting, "No, no, they're tweets.
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:30.460]   They're tweets.
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:31.460]   Stop calling them Twits.
[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:32.460]   They're tweets."
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.460]   Right.
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:34.460]   I mean, that's got...
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:35.460]   I think that's because of us.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:38.460]   I think that that is actually kind of a backhanded...
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:42.580]   He was like, "I think it's less me and more the pipe wrench I was holding."
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.860]   He said I'm a letter.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:45.860]   Did you really?
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.860]   And a pipe wrench.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:48.860]   Written by a lawyer.
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.940]   Written by a trained lawyer.
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:51.940]   Just want to say it.
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:52.940]   Michael Aarinton.
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:53.940]   Yes.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:55.660]   Now that, that would be good.
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.660]   I would hire Mike to be my lawyer in a minute.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:58.660]   All right, Nick, build it.
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:31:59.660]   Do you guys capitalize tweet?
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.620]   What's your style of men?
[01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:03.300]   We're not allowed to say tweet in articles.
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:04.300]   Really?
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:05.300]   Really?
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:06.300]   What Twitter posting is...
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:07.300]   A Twitter message.
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.300]   Oh, dear.
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.300]   Oh, of course.
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:10.300]   In a Twitter message post-diction.
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:11.940]   I remember they had like a article or something.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:12.940]   And why is that?
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   They announced this change.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:19.900]   It was a Phil Corbett, I believe it was, or one of the styles guys said that we're not
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:20.900]   allowed to use the word tweet.
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:22.660]   It wasn't about trademark.
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:23.660]   It was about being clear.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.660]   No, it was about language.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.660]   But it's now in the dictionary.
[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:26.660]   It's fine now.
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:28.860]   No, I like Twitter message better than tweet.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.860]   Actually, yeah.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.860]   I like tweet.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:32.860]   I do under lowercase.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.340]   You lowercase tweet?
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:35.340]   It's not a proprietary tweet.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.340]   I do too.
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.340]   That's our all things D style, which I think is weird.
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:38.340]   I would capitalize it because it's a...
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:39.340]   Why?
[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.820]   I think you should capitalize it too.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.620]   No, it's an action, though.
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:44.620]   It's an action.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.620]   Like, you can...
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.620]   But you can't tweet in other domains.
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.420]   You have to be using Twitter to use it.
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.420]   So it seems proprietary.
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:51.420]   Well, I don't know.
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.420]   Like, what about...
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.420]   What do you call a Google+?
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.420]   Well, that's awkward.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:56.420]   That's very awkward.
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:57.420]   Google+ message posting.
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:58.420]   I don't know.
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:02.420]   A message posting posted on the internet on a website belonging to google.com.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:04.380]   I just got an alert.
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:06.620]   Someone mentioned me in a comment on a post.
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:07.620]   There you go.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.620]   Congratulations.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.220]   If I were you, I wouldn't read it.
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:14.660]   So what's interesting is all things D has a style guide.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.060]   Mashable has a style guide.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:17.060]   This is the book.
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:18.060]   We have a hyphen startup.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:19.060]   It's terrible.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.380]   What's a hyphen startup?
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:21.380]   Start hyphen.
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:25.140]   Oh, you guys, we have to hyphen email and reader.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:26.140]   Anything.
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.140]   E hyphen reader.
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.140]   E hyphen.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:29.700]   E hyphen mail.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.700]   Web.
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.700]   E hyphen mail.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:34.100]   The website is capital W space lowercase.
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.100]   I know.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:40.260]   The reason for E dash mail is because the AP style guide, which we base our style guide
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:41.260]   on.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:42.260]   E is E dash mail.
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.820]   E used to because of the change in 1924.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:48.100]   They changed it to just email and so when they changed it, we changed ours to there.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:49.100]   So you find one of these.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:50.100]   This is awesome.
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:51.100]   I feel like I landed at the wrong dinner table.
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.100]   We you guys are all community stages.
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.100]   Brian and I don't have any style at all.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.900]   You just say it right?
[01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:57.900]   You get to say it.
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:01.300]   This week of journalism, you get it so you get become so ingrained.
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:06.340]   Like I look at people's tweets and I'm like, I'm they misspelled me edit that.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.340]   How do I go in and change that to space?
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.420]   I'm afraid they didn't lower case sites.
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.140]   I'm surprised, especially on the internet.
[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.060]   The web is uppercase.
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:15.540]   It's it's web space.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.540]   It's a guy.
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:17.540]   His name's web.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.260]   The web is a proper noun.
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:20.260]   Yes.
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.260]   You too?
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:23.740]   But now we we we we we under case it.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:25.380]   AP changed it.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:26.380]   Bizarre.
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:29.020]   See, this is what I love about doing audio.
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.500]   Well, so this is we can decide.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.860]   Not only can we decide how it's spelled because we don't spell it, we can decide that's pronounced.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:35.860]   What to call it?
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.380]   I decide how things are pronounced all the time.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:38.900]   I'm zagat zagat zagat.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:40.540]   Jif, jif, jif.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:43.380]   I decide and I say that's how it's pronounced.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:49.580]   And because for coop, because I am often the first person to say it out loud.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.580]   I win.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:55.260]   So I have to I do have to I have to say if you are a grammar nerd, which some of us at
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.260]   the table are.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.260]   Yeah, you have a sorry.
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.260]   The Times has a great site.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.460]   It's it's called it's by Phil Corbett.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:06.020]   If you look up the the Times grammar blog and what he does is it's called after deadline
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:11.700]   and he goes through every day and posts usages of words that were incorrect or correct and
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:15.780]   this guy just goes through and with a red marker on everything the internet did that
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:18.900]   did so it actually goes back to it.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:20.220]   I'm done with my New York Times history after this.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:23.140]   It goes back a long time ago and they were called the greenies and every day you would
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:26.740]   walk into the newsroom to be a pile of these green stacks of papers and there was this
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:30.420]   guy whose job it was to read the New York Times and find all the mistakes and write the
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.300]   them all down on the greenies and they would get handed out to them.
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:37.820]   Well, look here they apparently have misspelled ad nauseum.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.820]   You got E-mails.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:39.820]   The Argentinian.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:40.820]   Oh, too.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:45.020]   But Marseille is not pluralized.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.740]   So this is all content just just within New York Times.
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:48.780]   Yeah, okay.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:52.140]   The Argentine, not Argentinian stylist.
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:54.100]   A go denouncing in Twitter postings.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.100]   Oh.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.620]   These are the kind of things journalists debate every day.
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.620]   Yes.
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.100]   Isn't this sad?
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:02.780]   You know, it's better than thinking about the bitter sad.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:03.780]   I don't know.
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:04.780]   I guess it's beautiful though.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.780]   But somebody's got to do it.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:06.780]   No, I'm not.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:07.780]   I'm just glad it's not.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:08.780]   I love it.
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:11.340]   It's a look at everybody here is and we're going to talk about this art.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:15.660]   I'm going to say everybody here is a nerd and this is the ultimate and nerd is a great
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:20.420]   passion for a specific thing in great deep depth.
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:24.220]   That's what makes a nerd and whether it's action figures or grammar and I love that.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:25.220]   That's what we celebrate.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:28.460]   You should at some point and if he's ever in town is have Jesse Scheidler on your show.
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:32.660]   He's the editor and chief of the Oxford dictionary and genius.
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:34.140]   He's the greatest, nicest guy.
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:36.780]   I have the full 40 volumes in my office.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:37.780]   Oh, really?
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:38.780]   Oh, yeah, it's right.
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:39.780]   You do.
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:40.780]   I love the OED.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:41.780]   I have the full deal.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.780]   Hard cover.
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:46.180]   I just tweeted about this debate and now people are daring me to mention words on the show.
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:47.180]   Go ahead.
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.180]   Say a word.
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:49.180]   Two words.
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.180]   The two words I have Nianne Cat and I have sausage.
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.860]   And that's the words I was here to talk about.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:55.420]   Wait, you have to use those in a sentence.
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:56.860]   Oh, I guess we can talk about it.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:57.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:58.860]   I've been.
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:36:59.860]   You should have subtly.
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:00.860]   I know.
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.860]   I'm not a subtle person.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:02.860]   Look at this.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:03.860]   There's a trending.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.860]   I mean, not an even if we want to say who they are.
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.500]   Is that a known thing?
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:09.500]   We're aware of them.
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.500]   Whoa.
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:12.460]   They're going to get a letter from that same.
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:13.460]   Yeah, they're Google.
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.860]   We're going to send Erington over with a pipe wrench.
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:20.180]   So Nick wrote a great article a couple of days ago that I thought was this study is from
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:21.180]   Bitly.
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:22.180]   Hillary Mason.
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:23.180]   Hillary Mason.
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.180]   Yes.
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:25.180]   Oh, this is good.
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:27.820]   I like this because it confirmed what intuitively I think we all thought and noticed.
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:29.660]   Actually, I did not think this was intuitive.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:31.700]   Would you explain these results, Nick?
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.700]   Yes.
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:36.540]   So Hillary Mason, who is the lead scientist at Bitly and probably has bigger brains and
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:42.260]   all of us put together, did a study where she took a thousand of the top links that shared
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:46.100]   on Bitly and most links are shared on Bitly now.
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:51.340]   And she looked at the lifespan of the links and the an average lifespan of actually of
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:54.100]   a regular link is around three hours or so.
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:55.100]   Three hours.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.780]   Breaking news story, a link only lasts for about five minutes.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:01.700]   When you say what, keep in mind they're saying the half-life of it, which means half of
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:04.380]   it, all the links it's ever going to get have already happened.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.380]   Correct.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.380]   After three hours.
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.380]   Yes.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.380]   Five minutes.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:09.380]   So that long tail thing doesn't really mean.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:10.380]   Is it clicks or appearances?
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.380]   Clicks.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:15.140]   So if you post a link somewhere, is this true of a news article as well as a Twitter?
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:19.700]   So it's the same theory with everything except YouTube, but we'll get to that.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:22.900]   Where you have the spike and then it lasts for the half life in a certain period of time
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:24.740]   and then it falls off indefinitely.
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:26.660]   So you don't get a rebirth.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:31.260]   In general, a link that's published somewhere will get half of all the clicks it's ever going
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.060]   to get in the first three hours.
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.060]   Correct.
[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:36.140]   And if it's news related, it'll get half the clicks it's ever going to get in the first
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.140]   five minutes.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.140]   Five minutes.
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:39.140]   That's what surprises me.
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:40.140]   Five minutes.
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:42.740]   So what's interesting though is it's different on different sites.
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:46.740]   So Twitter, the average, the half-life is two and a half, 2.8 hours.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:47.740]   Little less.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:48.740]   Facebook is 3.2 hours.
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:49.740]   Little more.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:52.340]   An email and instant messages are 3.4 hours.
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:56.220]   So if you want a link to last a little longer, you'll get an extra 24 minutes if you posted
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:57.220]   to Facebook.
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:58.220]   Do you think that works?
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:38:59.220]   I mean, like that's a strategy.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:00.220]   That could be a strategy.
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:01.220]   I mean, it definitely is.
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:05.740]   In fact, after the research indicates that, and I remember, oh, Dr. O'J. J. Stone was
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:09.380]   talking about this research about Facebook anyway, like a year ago.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:12.300]   And that's when I finally started working on my Facebook presence because number one,
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:15.700]   of course, they've got, you know, we learned that finally there's 100 million Twitter
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:19.340]   followers users out there, but there's 400 million on Facebook.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:23.380]   And, you know, so I started working on the Facebook for that exact reason because they
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:27.060]   will go back and they'll mine because people on Facebook are constantly looking for even
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:28.060]   old stuff.
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:29.060]   They just want new content.
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:31.700]   I wonder about Google+, is that what it is?
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:32.700]   That's a really good question.
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:34.580]   I don't think that this is surprising.
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:36.300]   I mean, I think it's great to have numbers attached to it.
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:39.460]   But if you think about it, I mean, Twitter, I would actually expect Twitter to be shorter
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.820]   because it's a constant unfiltered stream.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:44.380]   Facebook, on the other hand, gives them weight to it.
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:48.380]   I think Nick was mentioning YouTube was the longest, but that makes sense because a link
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:51.180]   that's shared on YouTube, it's not really the same as sharing a link as a status message
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:52.180]   on somewhere else.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:55.060]   It'll probably be a link shared in the context of a video and a video as a longer shelf like
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.060]   a Twitter.
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.060]   And people return to that again.
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:59.020]   So I don't think that this is particularly surprising.
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:03.260]   I think it probably tells you that if you're in a medium, like say email where you're expected
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:06.900]   to kind of come back after a few hours and read all of it, you have a better chance of
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:10.060]   getting someone getting to it on Facebook, like where they do a little more filtering.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.340]   If it's interesting, it'll stay at the top on Twitter.
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:15.540]   It keeps going, keeps scrolling by, so you're not going to see it.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.660]   You don't think it's five minutes is surprising though.
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:18.660]   It's awfully short, boy.
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:21.660]   Well, the reason is because there's so many links to it.
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:22.660]   If it's new, it's earthquake.
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.620]   And the thing is where is earthquake?
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:27.260]   And then the thing is like, you know, what analysis?
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:31.660]   But I do agree, I think, but even so, like I still think five minutes is pretty amazing
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:34.740]   considering, I mean, this is a Washington Post link that she's referencing.
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:36.700]   Right, but keep it in five minutes later, it's done.
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:38.500]   It's not saying that the story goes away.
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.740]   It's saying that that particular link, so for example, we could both be linking to the
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.220]   same story, okay?
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:47.460]   But let's say Leo looks at his feed five minutes ago, Brian said something about an earthquake
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.700]   one second ago, Nick says something about the earthquake.
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:52.740]   He's going to click your link the most recent one.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:53.740]   Correct.
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:54.740]   I rest my case.
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.900]   But it's the same article is what I'm saying.
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:58.060]   I'm saying the article doesn't go away.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.820]   No, it's actually different articles, I think, at that point, because there's so much content
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.900]   flowing through and then some of the reach tweets and links.
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:04.460]   Makes them more canonical.
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:11.460]   I'm going to wrap this up with a pledge, a plea to help Kentucky get a Super Bowl ad.
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.460]   Huh?
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:16.460]   It's a kick-ass Commonwealth since 1792.
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:19.420]   Is this quick?
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:20.420]   This is a kickstarter.
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:25.060]   Hey, y'all, I'm Griffin Day-O-Meter and I'm with Tyler.
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:29.260]   This is our buddy, Kent Carmichael, who couldn't be their parent.
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:33.220]   We're here to tell you Kentucky's an awesome state.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:42.420]   They want to raise three and a half million dollars to buy a Super Bowl ad for Kentucky.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:44.220]   So far they've raised 29,000.
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.820]   Why do they want this?
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:46.820]   They love Kentucky.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.820]   Kentucky is awesome.
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:48.820]   We invented it for a win.
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:51.820]   But who watches the Super Bowl ads during the Super Bowl?
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.300]   They all watch on YouTube afterwards.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:54.460]   It was fine, whatever.
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.700]   I watch the Super Bowl ads.
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:56.700]   I love them.
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.700]   So you're saying...
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:58.700]   I watch them, I just don't watch them on the television.
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:01.700]   Right, but you still have to pay three and a half million dollars to become a Super Bowl
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:04.340]   ad that somebody will watch on YouTube.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:05.340]   So you're saying that maybe they could...
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:06.340]   See the man again.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:09.540]   We nurture beauty with Loretta Lynn.
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:14.460]   Is there this much latent desire for Kentucky branding in...
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:16.860]   Apparently 180 people believe.
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:18.580]   Anyone here from Kentucky?
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:25.060]   You know, we applied to Kickstarter for support in our studio project and they declined us.
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.060]   Why?
[01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:28.580]   But they have approved this kickass Super Bowl commercial.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:30.540]   Well, keep in mind, this is also...
[01:42:30.540 --> 01:42:31.540]   They declined people?
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:32.980]   Oh yeah, all the time.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:37.620]   This is exactly the type of thing that Kickstarter loves to promote.
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:42.700]   They love to see a few guys with a cookie idea that can only happen if everyone chips
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:43.700]   in a few bucks.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:44.700]   They're established for them.
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:45.700]   Yeah, I would say...
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.700]   I think that that was the thing.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:48.700]   So we weren't...
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:49.700]   So, and I don't mind, that's fine.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.700]   We raised actually a couple hundred thousand by selling these bricks.
[01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:52.700]   Rick's.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.700]   Rick's.
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:54.700]   And that worked quite well, I thought so.
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.700]   You guys still have any bricks for so?
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.700]   Yeah, we do.
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:57.700]   If you'd like to go to bricks.twit.tv, it's actually...
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:00.700]   I think we're gonna discontinue them pretty soon, the next week or so.
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.700]   Ooh!
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:05.700]   Can people still buy commemorative faux bricks so they can feel like they...
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:06.700]   No.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:07.700]   So you better move people.
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:08.700]   It's now your summer brick.
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:15.700]   What about brick.twit.tv?
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.700]   Brick.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:18.700]   After that, you're selling pipe wrenches.
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:19.700]   To break the bricks?
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:20.700]   No.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:23.700]   Actually, you know, I shouldn't say we'll never do it again because who knows?
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.700]   Maybe we will need money for that legal defense fund.
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:26.700]   There you go.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.700]   And at that point, we might have to go back.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:28.700]   Empty.
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:29.700]   No bricks order.
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.700]   I just say, though, the Kickstarter is fantastic.
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:32.700]   It's done.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:33.700]   I love Kickstarter.
[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:35.700]   Done so much, it helps so many little projects.
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.700]   Like it's a success.
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:37.700]   What have you paid for a Kickstarter project?
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:41.700]   I did I ask right in the beginning, gave him a hundred bucks.
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:45.700]   For some reason, I love the one in Michigan, they were trying to raise money for a statue
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:46.700]   of Robocop.
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:47.700]   There you go.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:48.700]   In Detroit.
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:49.700]   Downtown Detroit.
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.700]   It is such an awesome way to...
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.700]   The bizarre projects that you just never would have thought of.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:00.700]   When we featured a few of them on NSFW, we had the original MACE from the Ewok adventure.
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:01.700]   By the way, I just want to point out.
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.700]   They did raise enough money for that statue of Robocop.
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:06.700]   They are going to do it.
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:10.700]   Life is now complete in Detroit.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.700]   Now to build a real Robocop.
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:16.700]   Liz, have you ever paid for a Kickstarter project?
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:17.700]   Have you ever given anything?
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:22.700]   Actually, a friend of mine just raised money to make a documentary about toilet papering
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:23.700]   houses.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:24.700]   Yes, I saw that.
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:25.700]   That's a friend of yours?
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:26.700]   That's so cool.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.700]   Does she do it yet?
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:29.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:33.700]   He just finished, got, he met his goal, so he got the money.
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.700]   I think that 32 years of toilet paper houses.
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.700]   30,000 is enough to make a movie, but it's good.
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.700]   And by the way, the best name ever rolled.
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:41.700]   Love that.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:42.700]   But...
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:43.700]   But...
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.700]   I think it might not be a documentary.
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:46.700]   You mean like...
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:49.700]   Just an excuse to go toilet paper houses?
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.700]   They're just buying toilet paper.
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.700]   How many toilet...
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:57.700]   How many rolls of toilet paper can $34,133 buy?
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:00.700]   Do you think he's going to go out and toilet paper houses for this documentary?
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.700]   No, I think it's more like...
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:04.700]   He's going to get 13-year-olds on his left.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:05.700]   It's more like a left.
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:06.700]   It's...
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.700]   It's...
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:08.700]   I don't know.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:09.700]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:10.700]   I can see.
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:11.700]   What's your favorite Kickstarter, Preach?
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:15.220]   You know what, buddy of the show, Brett Rounsaville, made his lifelong dream come true.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:17.020]   He's actually written a comic book.
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:24.020]   If you do, Brett Rounsaville, you know him as the Amtraker, but he got $6,000 to make
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:27.540]   the first episode of a comic that he's wanted to tell forever.
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:30.340]   And it's like, it was almost like a religious experience for him.
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:32.780]   It was one of the greatest things that ever happened.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.780]   How do you spell Rounsaville?
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:38.780]   R-O-U-N-S-A-V-I-L-E, like it's a Rounsaville.
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:42.780]   I don't know, he got funded a while ago, so it might not even be up there.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:43.780]   Do they keep the old ones?
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:45.780]   They should have a hall of fame of all the fun-
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.380]   They do keep the old ones, absolutely.
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:48.380]   How about you and Nick?
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:50.580]   Ever buy a Kickstarter project?
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:51.580]   Kickstarter project.
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:53.780]   Yes, the vibrator was very interesting.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.780]   Dare I ask?
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:58.980]   No, actually, they pitched me about writing and I couldn't because it was the New York Times.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.620]   But it was actually a really interesting project.
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.460]   But I did purchase A. Watch the Apple...
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:05.460]   That was a very successful one.
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:07.460]   It was a really great camera-do-hick-these-and-divisions.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:08.460]   There's some great cameras.
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:12.260]   There was a project that came out of some ITP students at NYU where I was a professor
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.460]   for a while and they did something with the iPhone camera, this little stand that...
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:18.460]   It was a little plastic thing.
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:20.460]   Oh, yeah, so good.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460]   There's some great...
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.460]   I think Kickstarter is a fantastic, fantastic company.
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:26.460]   The chat room is howling for me to mention Get Set Go.
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:30.460]   Recently, they got funded live on NSFW the other day.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:31.460]   Thanks to you guys.
[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:33.460]   Yeah, Get Set Go, a fantastic band.
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:35.460]   They actually wrote our...
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:40.460]   As a thank you for them funding them, they wrote our end song for NSFW now.
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:41.460]   Wow.
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:44.460]   So this is an indie rock band that...
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:45.460]   They just wanted to make an album.
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:46.460]   They're like, "Pretty please."
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:47.460]   They came on...
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:48.460]   I'm seeing this a lot on Kickstarter.
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:49.460]   I think that's great.
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.460]   Well, people that publish books, it's great.
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:52.460]   Books?
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:53.460]   Documentaries?
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:54.460]   Yeah, I think this is really neat.
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:59.460]   So it was called the Glyph iPhone 4 Tripod Mountain Stand.
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:03.460]   You know, and the great thing about the Glyph, it seems like you're learning what really works.
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:07.460]   It's not only how good your idea is, it's how quaint your storytelling capability is.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:09.460]   And if you look at the...
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:13.460]   For the Glyph especially, it's almost like you're looking at a Wes Anderson trailer for something.
[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:14.460]   Hmm.
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:15.460]   I can't find it.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:16.460]   GLIF.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.460]   GLIF.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:19.460]   I think there are a few companies...
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:20.460]   There you go.
[01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:25.460]   There's a few companies who have already designed it, and they just want to sell a bunch of them.
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:31.460]   Well, I interviewed the guys who did the iPhone Watch, and he said that they were just sitting...
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:34.460]   They worked with Nike and Xbox that, you know, it's a big product.
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.460]   They're a real company.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:38.460]   But they said that they thought about this idea, and they thought, "Hey, would this be fun?
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:41.460]   Let's just do this little side project and not have any money to it and see if people are interested."
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:43.460]   And next thing there, they almost got a million dollars.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:44.460]   I remember the Glyph, actually.
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:50.460]   What's the point called "capture camera clip system?" and look at the ratio of what they wanted to what they got.
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:51.460]   That's the other thing I said.
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:56.460]   It could go over the amount of money that you asked for.
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.460]   They were asking.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:58.460]   They were for 10,000, yeah.
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.460]   They got 364.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:03.460]   That's just the guy making like a clip so you can put your camera on your belt.
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:04.460]   That's amazing.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:09.460]   It's been a launchpad for a good number of startups, and we're talking about an XLR lab startup called Joystick.
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:14.460]   It started as a Kickstarter project to create a paintbrush for iPads.
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:20.460]   The other thing I like about Kickstarter is we've talked about the democratization of fame thanks to the Internet.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:24.460]   You can all be a middle-class rock star, but now you can be a middle-class entrepreneur.
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:33.460]   You get all the thrill, you get to feel ownership of the project, and it's really insane.
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:34.460]   That's fantastic.
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:36.460]   You should start a Kickstarter right now.
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:37.460]   What do you guys think?
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:38.460]   What should we do?
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:39.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:41.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.

[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:50.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:51.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:52.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:53.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.

[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:06.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:10.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:11.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:12.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:13.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:14.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:16.460]   We're going to do a couple of things.
