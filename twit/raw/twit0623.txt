[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.800]   And he came back from the beach just to do this show. So thank you. Oh, yeah straight here from the beach Wow
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.760]   That's dedication. I appreciate that divinity. Did you take the subway or do you walk? I took the subway?
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.280]   It's a I'm right down the queue. So it's actually 25 minutes for me right from the beach
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.480]   So I go more often so you don't think of Brooklyn is like being 25 minutes from the beach
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.960]   Mm-hmm. That's nice bright. I mean yeah
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.680]   I mean Coney Island say our Brighton beaches there the nicer beaches are further away
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.620]   But if I just if you just want like a quick trip any New Yorker can get down there pretty easily pretty sweet
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.180]   also glad to have Georgia down back in a new environs because
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.040]   I didn't realize you had a rustic home. I thought you lived in a white box for most of the time
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.160]   Like this is the other this is my other area of basement, which is kind of yeah, you can see she's in the basement
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.120]   Buying a bigger home because they need more room for VR
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.160]   That could be true. I could be true
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.440]   My kids are also growing so I have that as well, but you can't keep in the closet anymore
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.120]   One of the things we've already told the real estate agent who knows nothing about VR is we need
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.000]   15 by 15 foot rooms
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.200]   And her mind is reeling
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.160]   What the hell are they up to I'm more calm of course and Georgia is also psychotherapist who it does really great videos at
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640]   anxiety-videos calm
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.560]   And we'll talk about those a little bit more later on and we're really glad to welcome back
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   Somebody we haven't seen in a while Jill Duffy of PC magazine is here. Hi, Jill. Hi. How are you?
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.000]   She was it's not completely my fault. I'm great. You were living in India chanai for the last two years, but you're back
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.120]   That's right. Yeah, so I'm in the Bay Area for a month
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.000]   Just to kind of chill out and then I'll be headed over to the east coast for a couple of months and then Bucharest
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.520]   And then Bucharest. Yeah, wow. I I love Buddha past is that near Bucharest?
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.760]   Not not especially close. Oh no same country, but you know what it's no different country
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.020]   Bucharest is a Romanian Romania Romania. Are you Romanian? Is that why you're she's Polish?
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.740]   She knows somebody somebody in the audience is correct. She went like this. Mm-hmm
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.380]   Bucharest is you know what it's Europe and anywhere in Europe is never more than like a two or three hour flight
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.360]   So everything is closer Bucharest sounds exotic and fun. Doesn't it that sounds exciting. Yeah, well welcome back
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.440]   And I'm so glad we can get you on a divindra offers us our first story of the week
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.940]   I didn't even know about this Disney. It was just announced yesterday. Yeah a brand new hotel a Star Wars hotel
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.120]   where
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.960]   Every guest gets a storyline. It's like Westworld
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.400]   This is gonna be where in LA
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.040]   It sounds like the Orlando so a Disney world
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.680]   but it's going to be part of the the new Star Wars lands that they're building galaxy's edge and
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.960]   That whole thing is gonna be a real interactive thing as well
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.480]   But this hotel sounds insane like as soon as you get there you could get costumes
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.400]   You'll get a custom storyline and it'll follow you throughout your entire trip there. You look at a window
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.240]   You'll be looking at space the windows don't show the actual place. They show space
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.000]   Wow, just like Westworld. I guess but yeah, I think the idea is that you're basically on a starship leaving earth with everyone
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.520]   You know in the hotel with you Disney of course owns the Star Wars franchise and they've opened big Star Wars
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.560]   Amusements in their parks or about that's what's coming right?
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.600]   That's so the galaxy's edges the Star Wars lands are gonna have all sorts of different rides
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:59.080]   And they give us more of a taste of it at d23 their expo in Anaheim and it's interesting to you that they talked about this
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.200]   You know ahead of comic-con kind of shows that you know the lessening impact of a big event like comic-con when Disney can just announce it themselves
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.720]   This would be a natural isn't that always the way it is though?
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.520]   There was calm decks and then people said that we don't need a complex and then we're C. Yes now
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.720]   We don't need C. Yes
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.400]   Apple used to have all these conventions now they do it all themselves
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.080]   Well, you know if you're a big company if you're Disney with a big story
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.240]   You don't need to do this at a convention. You don't want to do it as a good at a convention
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.120]   You want to do it where you're gonna get own all the press
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.000]   Definitely control the story completely like from start to finish. Yeah
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.360]   Will you stay in the Star Wars hotel when it opens?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.020]   I'm excited by it. Although I feel like yeah, we haven't learned anything from Westworld, right?
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.400]   Like they're they're gonna be actors there. They're gonna be people following you. They're gonna be droids and
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.600]   Yeah, it's only you know eventually will have like intelligent robots at hotels like this and experiences like this
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.180]   So we're kind of getting there I guess starting with this thing could possibly go wrong
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.000]   Basically a murder mystery crews only you don't have to be on a boat
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.520]   Exactly. Yeah
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:09.560]   We're just going all the way there. I'm all in sounds great the problem of the murder your mystery crews on a boat is you can't get off the boat
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:17.840]   Everybody's with you the same amount of time
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.120]   So at least you have that you have like a narrative arc that's gonna hold together
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.480]   Whereas if you have guests checking in at different times
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:31.880]   Interesting, but yeah, it's larping right it's larping basically just larping for adults
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.840]   It's a big like grandpa does and the Star Wars like the whole the land sound cool too
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.560]   Like you could run into people like you can run into Chewbacca
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.960]   I think was one example and he could give you a mission send you on like the millennium Falcon ride and depending on how well you do there
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.280]   You could get rewarded with more credits for the for the actual, you know theme park
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.800]   You could get yelled at and I think they can even send bounty hunters after you like chasing you throughout the theme park
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.880]   Which sounds really awesome. Yeah, I
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:05.420]   Think that some people may get too infused with this. That's my only worry is that so people are gonna get too excited and ruin it for everyone else
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.440]   So you have to assume
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.880]   I'll be there with it lays
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.840]   Don't fight that break out at Chuck E. Cheese's
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:25.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is like a big thing that happens is the Chuck E. Cheese's crowd the parents are just kind of like notoriously
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.280]   Get into these blowout fights. Oh, wow
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.400]   It's mostly because they're depressed that they're at Chuck E. Cheese. I would expect
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Taking tickets and yeah, it becomes
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   Nights at Freddy's or something
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.880]   Showed out Chuck E. Cheese
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:54.560]   Let's talk about some serious tech news. Maris Cara swisher has an article in a recode as you know
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.920]   They're looking for a new CEO at
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   Uber with Travis Kalanick stepping down and everybody has been suggesting names. So Cara decided she check and call
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.200]   Cheryl Samberg COO no sources say she's quite happy with her current position and
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:21.680]   Frankly who would really want to be CEO at that at Uber Susan Wojcicki who's running YouTube happy
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:29.320]   Loving her job also very rich sources said Wojcicki's not keen on playing cleanup for a lot of naughty tech boys
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.920]   How about Disney CEO Tom Staggs or former Ford CEO Alan Malali?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.160]   She says
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.080]   No, Staggs doesn't want to move or wait into the muck
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.880]   Malali told me flatly on the record. He has no interest and is very happy with his board seats
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.800]   Wow, it just goes on and on Monica Lee the head of Thrive Global
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.240]   Zero zero interest. Oh, this is a from Monica Lee who is the comms
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   Director talking about Ariana Huffington Ariana
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.240]   I'll say it in Ariana's voice has zero interest in this year old role
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.320]   And in fact is it sure I shouldn't do that shoot you work you work with her don't you at a AOL
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.160]   And the vendor I'm sorry as fact as the chair of the board search committee is fully engaged in finding the best CEO for Uber
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   So she's busy. What about
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.600]   Marissa Meyer
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.680]   She's used to trying to save a filling company
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:29.240]   Multiple sources say no
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:38.560]   Marissa has zero background and complex real world logistics. That's what Uber would require a leadership record that Yahoo this questionable
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.520]   anyway, who is
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.160]   The game continues who is gonna be the CEO who would want that job?
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.560]   I think it's probably high risk high reward though, right if you did well
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:57.440]   Mm-hmm. You'd make some money. It would just be funny if this role just stayed open for so long because it's like it's it's nuclear
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.200]   Right, it's radioactive. You don't want to touch this
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.800]   Because yeah, you could potentially save the company, but who really wants to jump into that mess too
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.480]   Like how do you save a culture that's you know flawed fundamentally?
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.920]   You'd have to pick someone that was in a bigger mess to want to choose
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.600]   Right like there's you're not good like the problem is is they chose people that were doing really well in their careers
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   Why would you risk that?
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.960]   You're doing really well for all of this bad press and negativity that you'd have to clean up
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.040]   So you'd have to pick someone that was either really into
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.120]   Huge risk for for fun, which is a really small pool of people
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.840]   Or someone that's just doing worse and wants to you know make a break
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.160]   According to the New York Times the applications are flooding in
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.560]   Mike Isaac writes uber offers a thankless job and the applications flood in because I mean you're it's a company in 80 countries is
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:58.000]   multi-billion dollar evaluation 50,000 employees. It's an opportunity if you can turn it around
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.280]   That he doesn't say who's applying
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:09.440]   Well, it's kind of funny that you could even apply for a CEO job is kind of interesting, right?
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.640]   Who do you call and what does the application look like?
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:20.440]   That almost sounds like counter mesh and messaging. Yeah, like you leak the story like oh no, we're not having trouble
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.880]   We're flooded with applications. Yeah, we got tons of CEOs. We got binders full of CEO applications guys
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.880]   So binders yeah, that that would be the counter message. I would want to send out you nailed it you nailed it
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.680]   So Game of Thrones is tonight. Yeah, I'm a shirt. Let me say what is it say winter is coming winter is here, baby
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.760]   Yeah, oh, I say are you the one with dragons? Yeah, of course. Yeah
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.000]   so I
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.840]   Watched the last episode of last season just to remember I've forgotten everything
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:57.200]   I watched the entire last season. I forgot most of it. It's been so long. She did what he did what?
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.840]   So, but now I'm caught up. I'm ready
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:08.120]   Be exciting tonight. So the question asked in the New York Times as Game of Thrones returns is sharing your HBO
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   password, okay
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:16.180]   Well, there's only one password right like aren't we all just sharing it around?
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:25.480]   So that's great. Jill why would you want to buy HBO a cable subscription? You only gonna be here for a little while
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:32.960]   Ah, but if you turn on some VPN and whatnot you can stream all kinds of good American TV no matter where you are in the world
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.360]   Ah, good point. Is that how you did it in India? Were you able to watch all this stuff in India?
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.880]   Yeah, some really interesting stuff happened with VPN though in the time that I was there
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:48.420]   So a bunch of services would start to recognize if you had VPN on and cut you off and
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.920]   Banks are really good at that too because they've got to be careful of suspicious activity
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:14:00.440]   Even if you have a VPN on so they would also notice that you had it on and ask for tooth factor authentication or say that you had to call the bank
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:06.920]   So it was the it was the content providers that were trying to block the VPN providers
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.500]   But then the VPN services said aha we're gonna come up with a new mode
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.200]   The service that I use came up with what they call chameleon mode that says
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.640]   Other party can't detect that you're using
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:25.760]   What do you mean? I'm in Indianapolis? What do you mean? I'm not I'm not in Chennai. I'm in Indianapolis. What do you know?
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   it's like
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.200]   like
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.880]   Everybody's just coming at it from a different angle
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.520]   Which I think is great for the technology because it's pushing people to do new things and figure out new ways of
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.360]   providing this service
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:45.440]   and it's forcing the content providers to realize that they have people sometimes all around the world who are legitimate customers and
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.600]   Do you want to continue consuming content or you know managing their online finances?
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:58.160]   So it's yeah, it's been really interesting to have to follow it much more closely than before so if you're in Chennai
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.760]   What do you watch? What do you want Netflix? What do you want? I've watched all of Netflix. I got to
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:11.760]   I do I do keep up with Game of Thrones. I love Game of Thrones and something that I thought was interesting about this show
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.200]   Is there changing it to 90 minutes this season somebody just came up?
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.440]   It's gonna be 90 minutes. It's gonna be long. Yeah, because that's sometimes they just do that
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:29.360]   Because my Sunday night eight that explains why they're starting at nine because they need to start early for
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:37.400]   Yeah, so they say that they can't get the the the amount of storyline that's going into each episode can't really be
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.520]   Gammed into 60 minutes. They're saying so they're gonna stretch it out to 90
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.080]   Which I think is great. I'm just looking up here. It's the finale that's gonna be 90 minutes, but that's still pretty crazy
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:53.040]   So the other episodes are gonna be 60 I assume so because that's just this is a really expensive show for HBO
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.200]   So they can't just like yeah all of a sudden make it super long
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.320]   But yeah the finale and this I think they're splitting this is this season two, right?
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.720]   Like we're gonna have another half of the season or something
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.600]   I hate it when they do that. Yeah, yeah
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:12.120]   Because then I have to wait again and try to figure out what's going on and really truthfully if I could I would just hold off
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.440]   I have no impulse control, but I would hold off and binge watch the whole thing at the end, but I
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.320]   You can't do that because you're you're on the internet all the time
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:27.680]   Yeah, someone will spoil it. You can't do that. You can't then you have to stay off every single set of social media
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:34.000]   Yeah, so I have to make sure I watch at the same date of you do Lisa doesn't understand
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.280]   I say I know I have to watch Silicon Valley tonight. Oh, you can watch it tomorrow
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:44.200]   No, I have to watch it tonight because then everybody be talking about it in the morning at least weeks have some cooler water cooler
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.640]   Conversations there are some shared experiences that the rest of the country lacks, right?
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.480]   They're all watching different stuff. We geeks. We know what we have to watch
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:17:00.280]   So it's it's actually something like Twin Peaks, you know, like the water cool conversations around all that and you the new season has been crazy
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.760]   Mostly it's like what the hell happened. Yeah. Yeah
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.520]   Do you understand it? No, do you know I don't understand
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.040]   Who's the woman in the log in the thing in the
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:17.600]   And there was what the last one that they just ended with or two episodes ago was one of the most like
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:23.520]   Astounding things I've ever seen on television and tell me I'm really figured out. I'm gonna binge watch it
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.280]   Yeah
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.840]   And so little things come in over the transom and I go no
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.920]   So uh
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.120]   They've exceeded Game of Thrones has gone beyond the books now, right or no
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.800]   Yes, this will be this will be beyond the books this season
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.360]   So which really asked an interesting question
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.560]   So you're George R. R. Martin the author of the Game of Thrones series
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.800]   Very happy that they made this because it's sold a lot of books where you've written what five
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.840]   It's five or six. I can't remember I stopped after three. I couldn't I was like some I swear
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.680]   I can't go on
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.920]   I'll just watch the show, but now
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.640]   What is he gonna do is he gonna write the books to match the show from now on or what's he gonna do?
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.440]   I was under the impression that he was he was signed
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:13.040]   He signed a contract with HBO that said he needed to give them the story arc to the end
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.280]   So he told them there was some concern about whether he would finish the books
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.880]   Possibly for health reasons and so they said you can't leave us hanging without the story
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.400]   So I believe this is what it is
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.760]   I'm not 100% sure
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.880]   But yeah that they that he's given them the major plot points to the end and he's just gonna write his books as he goes
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.160]   So he's written a game of thrones a flash of kings a storm of swords a feast for crows a dance with dragons
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.000]   That was 2011 now there's been nothing still to come the winds of winter and a dream of spring
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.720]   But those are he's in in process. Well, that's what the tv show is gonna cover
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.600]   Yeah, and he said in interviews through that the show is the show and the book is the book and he
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.920]   You know, he doesn't control what happens on the show
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.720]   He just kind of gave them some basic ideas because there are characters and they're big arcs that happen in the books that
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.800]   We'll never see in the show like in some really important ones advice at first
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.520]   So right there's characters in the show and stories in the show that are really whole cloth
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.760]   60 million copies he's sold
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.480]   Of those five books so far
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.000]   That's a successful and I don't know how much the show is making hbo
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.400]   But it's obviously very important to their success. All right. That's what we'll be watching
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.560]   That's what the geeks will be watching tonight. Don't bother
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.120]   On time leo. I gotta get out of here. Well
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.240]   It's a good point because it starts at six o'clock
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.480]   Pacific right nine p.m. Your time. Mm-hmm. Oh, we'll definitely be done by that
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:42.800]   Speaking of vpn. Are you excited about the the spin-off series? Is that gonna be horrible? Wait a minute. There's a spin-off
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.280]   There's gonna be a whole they have in the production
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.600]   I think five different ideas that they're going through and they're gonna choose one that's gonna become
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:56.480]   Yeah, a spin-off series for when it's done. It's all gonna be over soon, right? So yeah, it's too soon for hbo
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.040]   It could be it could be cool. Um, I mean like uh, I think of like better call salt, right?
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.240]   Which is the spin-off prequel. That was very bad. Yeah, that was true
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.360]   And that shows end up being better than breaking bad. I think in so many ways
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.400]   Uh, so there's the potential to do something good, but also it does sound like hb. I just wants to keep this
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.560]   You know keep milking this cow forever
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.400]   so
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   I'm thinking about your your story
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.720]   about Jill about
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.400]   using vpn's in
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.400]   India to watch american television
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.640]   China has announced that by february 2018
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.120]   You will not have access to a vpn in china
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.080]   it's an interesting
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.960]   technical challenge I imagine but it's also an interesting story that the chinese government's known that
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.440]   People have been using vpn's in china to get around the great firewall so that they can you know
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.360]   See things like facebook and twitter and probably watch tv shows and all sorts of things
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.040]   And I was always told even you know five or six years ago
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.720]   That the government knew it but they were they they weren't worried so much about the elites using vpn's
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.320]   They were worried about
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   The kind of the mass of the population finding out what was going on in the world outside
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.920]   Maybe now they're worried about everybody or maybe vpn's have become more commonplace
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:18.000]   So they're gonna bar the idea is that that if you get it in a service in china
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.440]   You get it from china mobile china unicorn or china telecom those services will block vpn's
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   I don't know how they're gonna handle chameleon mode
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:33.040]   Hmm it seems it's this is yeah, it seems to me
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.920]   Well, I understand this this underscores how difficult it is
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.640]   For a country these days to isolate their population from the outside world
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.880]   You know what's up?
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.120]   That's what it's really about or if it's more about surveillance
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.320]   Ah
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.160]   dissidents
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.600]   Yeah
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.080]   I think that the latest statement from the
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:03.120]   China's ministry of industry said that their authorized vpn's will still be allowed
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.720]   So maybe it is about surveillance because then they can still surveil who they want
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:13.680]   Authorized music and watch what's going on inside the top. Yeah, exactly. So it's not that would make sense. Yeah, that would make sense
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.400]   Well, we'll be getting that soon. I'm sure
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.960]   Uh
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.600]   Well, it is it's part of an overall trend across the world
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.640]   To break encryption to make sure that people can't go dark that that there's nothing you can no communications you can have that
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.600]   the government can't see
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.760]   And yeah, it's in China now, but I you know you got to wonder
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.240]   There's clearly a move afoot in the west to do the same similar things
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:47.040]   Let's take a break. We're gonna come back and then we'll talk about google releasing 20 million bacteria infected mosquitoes in fresno
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.760]   Uh, I kid you not
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   That's the story, but first a word from
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.520]   kept era

[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.480]   Can I recommend kept era instead kept era?

[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.680]   in tech
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.880]   Joining us today, Georgia Dow from imore.com in her rustic basement
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:46.960]   And there's a some serious concern in the chat room about your about your ceiling whether it's asbestos
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.520]   But I think the consensus is it's not it's not it's uh, it's like some old stucco thing
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.000]   Yeah, i'm okay, but thank you
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   You see you forgot you're letting these people into your life
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.040]   Also, yeah, also with us Jill Duffy wisely is sitting in front of a completely blank wall
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.840]   We can't tell anything at all about Jill. That's all right. Am I who am I nobody knows?
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.640]   We just we just know you're going to Bucharest
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:23.520]   Uh, and you will find your writing at p that's what she says at pc magazine at dot com and of course fast company as well
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.560]   It's always great to have you jills beat covers a lot of areas
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.880]   But also but particularly time management fitness things like that have you tried a peloton yet?
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.440]   Have you done a no yeah
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.800]   Uh, Lauren good did a good one and that kind of convinced me to to get one and I have to say I love it
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.880]   It's a it's the spin cycle that's got an internet. It's got a big and red tablet on it
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.240]   You've got live classes from Brooklyn. You can watch. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:54.080]   Anyway, just put in a plug something you might want to try just for review also to vendor harder. War is here
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.800]   Let me ask the landra what phone are you using these days?
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.720]   I'm gonna hold on to my iPhone success until like it dies because I need a headphone jack
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.120]   And I think apple's being very dumb about this whole thing
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.600]   interesting
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.960]   I have to say i'm a big android fan and I carry a pixel as well as an iphone. Oh, yeah
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.120]   I love the pixel excel. I love it, but I am increasingly worried about android
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.640]   I'm curious what you think about all this because you cover this subject
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.120]   uh android security
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.000]   Is it yeah, is it becoming an issue to the point where it's not safe to use an android phone anymore?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.080]   I don't know. Is there something specifically you're wondering out?
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.920]   Yeah, well first of all we keep hearing about malware and yeah, the biggest issue is and the reason this came up for me
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.160]   Somebody was calling that he has a motor roller phone a motor
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.960]   Roll this makes a very good android handset. He has a g it hasn't been updated since April
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.520]   No security patches and he's still running 7.0 current version 7.1.2
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:58.320]   And now with the pixel we get the updates one of the reasons that I use a pixel and won't use other brands is because I want those updates
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.600]   I feel safe with the updates, but I really think the mass
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.240]   the majority more than majority
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.600]   90 percent of android users are not
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.760]   Up to date. They're not being protected and even if you have a samsung phone
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:17.680]   You know, you may be a month or two behind the security patches. My s8 is still 7.0
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.400]   I really wonder
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:26.000]   If it's time to start thinking and I see a lot of security experts starting to say yeah, don't like okay
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.840]   So here's why I'm wondering black hat is this week. I could next weekend is coming up
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.720]   Would you be I think I number of people said you'd be insane to bring an android phone to black hat?
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   I wouldn't bring anything to black hat. I mean, I
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:44.320]   I wouldn't bring anything with the radio turned on like I'd bring like a you know a tiny little like a dumb phone or something
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.800]   but you got to be really careful about anything but
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:52.320]   Yeah, I think the fear is warranted and we've been talking about android updates for so long and
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.840]   Manufacturers have had so long to kind of speed up their update cycles
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.960]   And I think even googles brought this up to companies and yeah, I haven't seen a huge improvement
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.200]   Maybe if things get worse like things have to get worse before they get better
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.680]   So there will probably have to be some sort of like big malware attack that affects
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.320]   You know millions of phones before they actually step up their game
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.440]   But I think the problem is even if that happens google doesn't have the means with which to update most of these
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.720]   Android phones
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.520]   They don't yeah, all they can do is like be like, you know, please just moving forward. Yeah
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:29.440]   Um, when you were in India, I'm sure Jill. What did you what did you bring a phone to India?
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.320]   I brought an old unlocked iPhone
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.000]   Um that I could kind of trash and not worry about and then I got a one plus two
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.400]   Which I know is two or three. Yeah two or three years old now, but it's yeah
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.960]   It's a nice it's a nice device to have something
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.400]   To take nicer photos than an old iPhone and just to play around with some android hardware
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.200]   But I bet you as you looked around you saw a broad variety of inexpensive android phones
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.080]   Not so many iPhones
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.440]   So here's the thing people asked me that a lot about what did I see in India and india is just a strange place because
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.520]   People who have money
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.080]   At least in south india tend to be very private
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.080]   So you don't see you don't interact very much with people on the street
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.800]   Um, it's just a very different culture and then people who have inexpensive phones
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.120]   You're often talking about flip phones
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.560]   Um, and especially among the very poor people something we forget about in the us is that
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.400]   Uh, I think somewhere around 24 percent of indians population is illiterate
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.200]   So what good is a smartphone if you can't read or write?
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.520]   Right, so so the phone still makes sense in a lot of places where
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.000]   Or when you're communicating with a lot of different people in different languages, right?
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.520]   Like maybe you can speak them, but you can't write all of them. So there are are a variety of reasons why
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:52.320]   Um, there's no one phone that stood out to me a lot of people had one pluses. I guess
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:58.560]   Um, people definitely had more non iPhone phones than iPhone phones
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:04.160]   But there was no one phone that stood out to me. There was no one trend that stood out to me
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.440]   There's such a huge variety of different people different different socio-economic groups different languages
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.520]   different literacy levels
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.400]   Uh, that there's just no uniformity whatsoever. It's interesting
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.240]   Yeah, I mean they have very strong uh tariffs so
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.680]   Unless you make a phone in india, it's hard to get it into the country and I think one plus does
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.880]   And apples fox con has said they were they they're building an indian plant
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.840]   Yeah, I think there's I think that's the plan is that they're going to start manufacturing some iPhones
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.240]   India i'm not sure the details. Yeah
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:44.240]   So but yeah, I just I think that this is the so the heterogeneity of it and the fact that you've got a lot of inexpensive android phones
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.800]   uh particularly areas uh
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.440]   Where people can't afford more expensive phones is is a big cause for concern
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.600]   And when we talk about android security and there's there's issues we've been talking about on security now. There's issues like with um
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.320]   For instance facebook has this uh, you know those chat heads right those bubbles that come up
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.080]   You don't get them on the iphone because apple won't let you do that kind of thing
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.000]   You can't modify the user interface
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   But on android when somebody chats with you on messenger their head pops up in a little bubble
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   You can move around or you can you can tap on to open the message
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.760]   And it's so it's a kind of neat notification except it relies on
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.360]   Uh a feature in android devices the ability to write on top of existing applications
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.680]   It is a massive security problem. It allows people to uh,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:35.600]   To fake, you know websites and fake forms and to and to get the data from a form
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.440]   You might be on what you think is your bank's app but instead you've got a chat head like technology
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.400]   Putting the form there and you're filling it in and sending it to the hacker
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.200]   And google's kind of an a rocket between a rocket and a hard place
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.360]   They they would like to turn this right over feature off, but they've said it's not a bug
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.800]   It's not a flaw
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   Because so many apps use it
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.040]   Particularly the big blue app the most important app on most phones
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.520]   They can't turn it off
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.840]   So there's some significant problems, I think
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.960]   Uh with android and I don't think google's really addressing these issues and I think you're right divinor
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.920]   I think what's going to happen is at some point there's going to have to be a big
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.720]   Mess
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.240]   It's kind of a shame. I mean, I've been thinking about it cyber security too, especially after all these ransomware attacks
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.360]   And uh, I just did a piece of engagels. Well, just like what what could we do about this?
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:31.440]   I've I use I spent several years working it as well and I get that mentality that you can only update so much
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.400]   You can't update to the newest operating system all the time because of
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.600]   Legacy support or your institution isn't going to give you enough funding to do all the upgrades you need to do
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.800]   And uh, you know, there are possibilities like a lot of people are just waiting for like one big attack to happen
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.360]   To make all the companies kind of wake up and invest more cyber security and to make company make governments pay more attention to
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.600]   Some people think regulation is probably the better answer and that
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   Maybe more of where we need to go if you think about cyber security in the vein of something like seat belts
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:10.800]   Um, and you know security for cars, uh, when seat belts were being you know when they were first being discussed a lot of car companies, especially for it
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.960]   I think um really fought against it as something that would like her innovation in cars and her consumer choice
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.120]   It's seat belts. It's they save lives. So if companies can't even agree about that
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.320]   Like I wonder what it would take for cyber security to really happen
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:30.240]   Well, and I wonder if a government can make a regulation that makes any sense at all and has any
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.320]   Well, the people thing did happen, right? They started a commission as a automotive safety commission
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.760]   They fought for it and you know, it took a couple took a while
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.280]   But now it's a standard thing. We kind of take it for granted and it's saved millions of lives or at least
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.600]   At least hundreds of thousands of lives. Yeah
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.920]   Uh, the problem with the government regulating though would be that the government would say listen
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.320]   We also then want you to give us the keys, right?
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.640]   And we already know that that doesn't work out well
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.840]   Right. And so then that becomes a really difficult issue because I and I can understand what governments would want that
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.400]   But it just then leaves us
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:08.880]   Still in an insecure place and if you have a great government that sounds wonderful, but anyone can have you know governments change
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.960]   Yeah, it's it's we're in a really weird spot around cyber security in general
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:22.000]   And I just think like when wanna cry happened, you know, the NHS was was attacked and things were shut down in hospitals
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.440]   Had trouble even functioning like an attack that at that point human lives are at risk as well
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.080]   You mentioned it. I wonder how much further to go you mentioned your article that new york has
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.320]   cyber security regulations for financial companies
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.640]   Yeah for like big financial institutions and they a lot of people fought against that too
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.240]   Um, but you know, that's we don't know what the result of that is
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   We don't know how much that's going to protect these companies, but certainly better than nothing I'd say
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:55.600]   Uh, just making sure it's that's just about accountability. That's like somebody in your company is a cybersecurity, you know, czar
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.640]   They're the person in charge of making sure you're following
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.440]   All these rules and making sure you're charting
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.080]   You're actually following cyber security rules and doing all the updates and things like that
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.400]   And actually logging potential risks as well and accountability
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.480]   That's a good start at least rather than forcing, uh, pure regulations on people
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:20.000]   Henry for the second who was the ceo ford in the sixties when the seat belt laws are proposed said
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.400]   We're gonna have to shut down
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.360]   If they if they make this a law, we're gonna want good. We're gonna have to go out of business
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:33.600]   So you can see the the you know the intense pressure even on something as sensible as a seat belt law
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.560]   You mentioned uh one of the things in new york state for instance would be uh, um
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.640]   You'd have to disclose if there's a breach a lot of a lot of breaches are happening that aren't disclosed
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.920]   Particularly in financial institutions that aren't disclosed so that's
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.160]   Yeah, requirement to disclose
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.840]   Somebody in the chat room saying
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.000]   Couldn't you have a regulation that said if you sell an android device in the united states? You have to
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.280]   Uh, you have to have google's monthly security patch, uh, within 30 days of the patch's release something like that
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.800]   Could you do that?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.880]   That would be effective or better than nothing
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.600]   That would be but I know and then yeah, go ahead
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.560]   I I think that in you know when we talk about accountability would have to be financially being accountable
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.280]   So if you could sue a company because they let you know
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.680]   This much software out and it became some sort of a big fine then companies would really listen
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.960]   I don't think that if we're hoping that out of the kindness of you know
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.760]   Their hearts people are gonna choose to make sure that their their phones are really like safe
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.480]   Um, I don't know that's gonna happen. So yeah
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:37.280]   Well, and then there's also the issue that the cyber is international and you can't uh
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   You can have a regulation in New York state
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.840]   You can have a regulation in the united states, but you can't prevent every you know
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.480]   Other countries from offering services and this is part of the problem actually it's one of the good things about
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:55.920]   The secu- this the encryption debate is the u.s. Can block encryption doesn't gonna in any sense eliminate encryptions availability
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.600]   Yeah, but we're in really sticky territory right now, right because when want to cry happened
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.880]   And that was you know due to a windows xp flaw, right?
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:13.920]   That was discovered by the nsa and never revealed and it was stolen from the nsa and hacker stole it and deployed it and used as a weapon
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:20.240]   Like that's really sticky territory then like I taxpayers faulted paid for the development of this exploit
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:26.000]   Pretty much and then got exploited by it. Yep. Yeah, so maybe we start there
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.080]   Although it's hard to you know this is also challenging and that there there has been for years
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.560]   uh a process that I don't think has ever really been fully used
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.720]   Uh for revealing these flaws and all the players come to the table and have to justify
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.360]   Uh, you know, we found this flaw, but we have to justify keeping it a secret
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.880]   But there there is certainly instead of to do that because you can use that now to capture a terrorist
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.600]   That's that's valuable at the same time. They have to assess well if if for instance
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.320]   There's actually a whole set of criteria on this. That's kind of interesting. Let me see if I can find it
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.040]   But uh things like well if this flaw were discovered or released how
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.040]   Bad would it be how you know how widespread would the problem be?
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.720]   Um things like that where they have to assess that and say well, maybe we you know, maybe
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:22.800]   You have to balance capturing a terrorist versus bringing the nation's infrastructure to its needs and which to its needs
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.080]   And a lot of these things may not even be as concrete as capturing a terrorist right?
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:34.240]   We uh, government told these exploits to just use them against the competition like use them against their rivals or even sometimes allies like
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:40.000]   Yeah, it's it's really sticky territory and we don't quite know what's up yet like after a steck's net
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.960]   Right like I think the entire game has changed when it comes to like international cyber warfare
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.600]   And we've seen a lot of countries kind of deploy their own things after that. So
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.200]   Yeah, there are a lot of conversations we need to have I think um
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.960]   There's probably more of a need to have more dialogue around cyber warfare and cyber security and countries are talking
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:06.160]   There's been like talks between the us and china when obama was uh was president and we don't know where much of that stands now
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.000]   Companies like microsoft are talking about doing something like a digital janeva convention
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.760]   Because we may need that we need some sort of agreement for everybody to play on the same ball field basically
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:21.840]   The uh the process I couldn't remember the name is the it's called the vulnerabilities equities process. It was proposed
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.880]   Uh in the abomb administration some years ago
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:30.240]   Uh and has not been widely used although it is it is around there in fact the latest
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.280]   Uh from the current administration is well, we're going to let the nsa and other intelligence
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:44.080]   Communities decide what they're going to reveal but the idea existed in government that there should be this conversation about these vulnerabilities
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:50.880]   And and what the pros and cons are of releasing them or telling the companies telling microsoft for instance to patch it
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:57.280]   So these are the the list of considerations. This was released in 2014, but presumably is still being used
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.080]   Uh when applying the vulnerabilities equities
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:09.040]   Process for instance how much is the vulnerable system used in the core internet infrastructure and another critical infrastructure systems in the us economy
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.280]   Or in the national security systems does the vulnerability if left unpatched?
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:20.480]   Impose significant risk how much harm could an adversary nation or criminal group do with the knowledge of this vulnerability?
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.960]   Obviously none of this was applied to the to the uh, uh,
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.280]   the smb
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:34.560]   Exploit that ended up being the powering the the network worm capabilities of wanna cry or or maybe they would have told microsoft
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.480]   Hey, you got a problem with smb
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.080]   How likely is it that we would know if someone else was exploiting it?
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:47.440]   How badly do we need the intelligence? We think we can get from exploiting the vulnerability? Are there other ways we can get it?
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.280]   This seems this is I have to say when I read this I thought this is very fair
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.040]   This is balanced this balances the need of law enforcement
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:02.000]   To catch bad guys and the need uh from us in the jet the general community to be protected against vulnerabilities
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.600]   That could be used against us by our government by other governments by criminals
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.400]   Could we utilize the vulnerability for a short period of time before we disclose it?
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.880]   A little bit just a little bit how likely is it that someone else will discover it?
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.960]   Can it be patched or otherwise mitigated? These are I think very appropriate questions
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:28.560]   It assumes though that the people that are making these rules in assessing this have enough technological knowledge to be able to
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.040]   To really properly assess that
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.360]   Well, the idea
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.360]   Was and I don't know if it's still going on the idea was you bring in
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.800]   a a committee a panel of experts coming from law enforcement and
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.320]   Security experts people like bruche snire so that that you get all the voices heard you're exactly right
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.640]   You have to have all that information to make that decision
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.960]   um
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.040]   I my sense is it's not widely used. I mean they they put this in place
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.880]   But I don't know if they use it and clearly the uh nsa has been hoarding
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.720]   And and the cia hoarding all sorts of exploits that have
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:13.280]   Huge impact once once they were leaked and these days these exploits are as valuable as having a stockpile of nuclear weapons
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.520]   You know, that's what I can do a lot with them. Yeah
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.480]   In a way in a lot of ways much more so because there's not the same type of fallout
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.680]   You're not going to get the same negative press and you can get much more information and control full systems of government through this
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:35.520]   Uh, google's pixel will be coming out. We're going to see I think before so apples calendar calendar stuff here
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:41.120]   We're in july apple will probably announce iphone 10th anniversary edition in september if they're on
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.120]   The schedule they've been using for the last five or six years
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.000]   Uh last year google and sam song
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.320]   Right before the apple announcement announced the pixel in the sam song note
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:58.080]   Uh seven because they wanted to get it before the apple stole all that took all the air out of the room
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.880]   So i'm going i'm going to think that in the next month and that's what the rumors say by the way
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.680]   We're going to see announcements from sam song on the note eight
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.960]   Probably they I think august 23rd you guys said I think i can gadget was going to be august 23rd
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.920]   and uh the 2017 pixel
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.320]   Which we're already seeing some strong rumors. This is uh
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:24.880]   This is an image from android police that they say is an accurate represent we're highly confident
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.520]   Is an accurate representation?
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.000]   A google's 2017 flagship phone
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.640]   This is the time end device there at least two pixel phones coming
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.480]   All I want to say i'm sick of it that's stupid glass thing from the back
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.840]   Yeah, it looks like they're not as small as though there it is on the right uh, but in the fingerprint reader's right below it
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.200]   That's frantenas right devendra. I think so, but it's also
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.320]   We've solved this problem where a lot of other manufacturers have so I don't quite understand
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:59.200]   Uh, you know the need for this, but uh, I really like the pixel phones the pixel excel is my like go to international android phone
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.840]   And it's it's held up so having a version that's like, you know, a little less bezel around the front
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.360]   That's very nice and the story was it was rushed and it wasn't really ready to go and it wasn't waterproof
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.240]   It didn't have wireless there were things missing that they would presumably add
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.280]   This is like everybody else's new phones is going to be
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.240]   Almost bezel lists designs going to go edge to edge
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:24.240]   LG is supposedly going to make it which is good news because they do the lgg6 is a very nice
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:30.320]   Device it looks like a single camera though not the twin cameras you see on the g6 and the iphone 7
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.240]   plus
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.400]   Uh, although the pixel cameras are very good
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.840]   Um
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.320]   Don't know what pricing will be
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:46.960]   Now there are other phones for instance, Andy Rubens essential in fact there was some news with essential essential which had
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.280]   Andy Ruben had promised at the
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:56.080]   Recode conference that we would see his essential phone bought like in 30 days and that was in june and we haven't seen it
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:01.360]   And now the the newly hired chief marketing officer essential
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.760]   Is gone just quit?
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.960]   Maybe trouble and essential
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   Yeah, I mean that that whole thing always felt a little like vaporware to me and I don't understand why
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:19.040]   Andy Ruben's big solution to smartphones is to build another smartphone that likes very similar to all the others
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.440]   So yeah, yeah stuff. Yeah
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:27.040]   Um, I I put in a pre-order, but I haven't heard anything for them
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:32.560]   Uh, USA today says sprint will be the one carrier they'll get and that's not good news because
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.760]   That means very few people know about this phone if it's not in the carrier stores. Nobody hears about it
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:44.880]   It's also a bezel to bezel of an hd edge bezel is fun with a little notch cut out for the camera the front camera
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.320]   Which is a little weird, but uh, hey there you go
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:56.480]   All right, we're gonna get to iphone seven rumors since since none of nobody's got excited about the uh, the pixel rumors
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.840]   But george is all excited about the iphone
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:07.120]   Including this rumor that it will have a mirrored case or a mirrored a mirrored finish one of the four colors available
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:12.640]   What do you think it does look beautiful? I like it. I like it. I could use it to put on lip gloss
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:17.200]   Um, it'll bother me to have fingerprints all over it. So I'll be cleaning it all the time
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:23.440]   Now I have to worry. Do I get a case? Do I not get a case? Um, yeah, I like it. I think it looks great
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:31.280]   Uh rumors that will have a faster. I think this is no surprise a a 11 processor some form of wireless charging and of course
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.600]   At least one of these will have an old led screen
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:40.240]   Uh apple's been buying all the old ed screens it could find and because of this old ed screen may not have a fingerprint reader
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.080]   They may be abandoning the fingerprint reader in favor of face recognition
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:50.960]   Slash iris recognition and i'm sorry to vindra. I don't think there's going to be a headphone jack on this one
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:59.280]   I yeah, it's terribly sad too because if you go back to like why they dropped the headphone jack with the iphone seven was to make more room for
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.960]   3d touch right to have a slightly bigger 3d touch module in there
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:08.480]   They haven't done anything with that. It just feels like we lost a key feature for no real reason. It's
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:14.240]   It's sad if samsung can put a headphone jack in the sa it may as a plus and apple can
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   I don't know
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.320]   Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm unfortunately I we're not probably getting back that much
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.040]   I was with you though. I did this it the iphone seven is the best selling iphone ever
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.920]   Everybody said oh, we don't need that
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:34.560]   I mean, I think a lot of people just upgrade too, but yeah, it's it's less of a
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:41.120]   I'm sure it's less of a problem to some people like just on a fundamental level like the the person in me the tech
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.240]   you know helper in me who wants to like defend consumer rights and stuff like
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:51.440]   Losing that seems like a big deal and I'm using the beats x most of the time with my iphone
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.120]   So I've actually pretty much gone wireless, but I have nice headphones
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:59.520]   I'd like to be able to plug them in without another extra dongle for no reason. That's really the big problem
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:06.080]   I also don't think that apple has solved the issues bluetooth still has bluetooth. Yeah, I I'm using air
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.160]   I mean air pods with an iphone seven plus that should be the the perfect solution, right
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.000]   It randomly switches from the air pods to the phone
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.760]   It it disconnects every person goes silent
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:24.000]   I don't make many phone calls and I have so many problems with this. I feel like they haven't fixed the bluetooth thing
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.520]   It's just yeah, I rarely can do a phone call with my air pods in my iphone
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.440]   I've noticed that with the beats x2 like sometimes I'll accept a call and it'll go straight to the beats x it
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:39.200]   If I make a call sometimes I have to choose it manually and I don't I don't understand the logic between doing that. Yeah
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.280]   Somebody's in the chatroom says to vindra. There is a headphone jack. You just have to use an adapter
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.120]   Yeah, I don't think just an adapter
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   Just another dongle
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.920]   If you think about like other ways that apple has taken away
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.960]   Um sort of standard features, right? So the do you remember when the iphone first?
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.680]   Switch to the lightning is called the lightning plug right?
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.160]   Nobody was like why wouldn't you just make a micro usb just be like everybody else or
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.920]   Um, they started taking away the ethernet ports on the macbooks
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.120]   If it was like why would you I don't want to have to buy a 30-dollar connector piece
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:23.840]   But apple has kind of staked its claim or you know put its flag down and said we're gonna do things our way
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:30.320]   We're gonna have proprietary pieces on our technology and that's what we're gonna do and people continue to buy the devices
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.000]   So why should they there's no incentive to change right? Yeah, exactly
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.120]   Although that that's yeah, go ahead. I it's my contention that that's actually bad for apple
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:44.720]   And you've seen this happen before when you have when you have a fabulously successful product of the company
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.880]   And the company makes tons of money on it
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:52.480]   What that ends up doing is hurting the company because there's no pressure at all to innovate to improve
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:59.840]   And they end up coasting and coasting downhill and i'm i'm absolutely convinced that's what's happened to apple
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.040]   The iphone was too successful. It was bad for apple
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.800]   Well, we need like I think especially what happens at this point where i was like they've innovated
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.920]   They've done so well
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.200]   This is a point where you kind of need to like step back and do something completely different
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.280]   I don't think the apple watch was that and my bigger worry is apple betting on
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:24.640]   Big features that nobody really cares about and they it doesn't even really fully support the touch or 3d touch bar. Yeah
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.800]   Yeah, these are these are gimmicks
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:32.960]   They're gimmicks. Yeah, nobody I know really likes that 3d touch. I wanted to love so much apple itself killed that by not
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.000]   Giving developers enough access to it. So it's like make up your mind
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.440]   If you're really going to invest in these features like let us do more with it
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.920]   Let developers show them off in new ways
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:47.440]   It took a year for 3d touch to really be upgraded for devs and then even then like the new
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:53.120]   They had to add better 3d touch hardware to even enable some of these features what's left the earlier people in the dust
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:59.360]   Uh, the argument that apple tends to make these changes often, um, you know, killing older connections
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.240]   That that's there. They've done that and they've done that successfully
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.760]   I don't know about this particular one and you talk about the lightning jack thing, right?
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:11.680]   They're stuck with the macbook, um, and the the new macbook pros which have USB-C connections for a long time
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.840]   Those didn't have cables to even plug in
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.560]   You know the iPhone 7
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.560]   It's like if you can't if you can't even plug in your devices they can't even talk to each other
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:26.480]   Something has gone wrong. There is a skitsoid thing going on where they've got the lightning port on some stuff in the site types
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.800]   You know, there's yeah, the story was apparently that they wanted to do something like type c
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   But it just was not ready yet
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.320]   So they did lightning and I have to say the lightning is a big improvement over that
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:43.280]   August 30 pin connector they used to have but but they're they're kind of at a step with the rest of the industry
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:48.880]   So now they're stuck and could they abandon the lightning and put a type c on the next generation iPhone?
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.920]   That'd be a painful thing to do and yet I think it would be the right thing to do make everything type c
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.560]   That's what everybody else is doing and I think apple is involved in the type c like conversation as well like yeah in the standard
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.920]   So yes, there's stand. I don't see them giving up on lightning, but
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.320]   I would like to see more. I don't know more cross compatibility and yeah
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.160]   I'm gonna hold on to this headphone jack thing for a while like it's just let them go. Are you?
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.840]   I'm not letting go it's it's a problem and it's dumb and even a big
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:21.200]   Successful company like like apple can make dumb decisions and yeah, I'm not gonna just forget about it
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.400]   So there's with them selling so many they're not gonna care right?
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:31.040]   Yeah, they don't care. It's just me making our choices with our pocketbooks and that's exactly right
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.000]   That's what I'm saying
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:39.520]   Successful if apple made a huge change and really innovated and it was a flop everyone would be jumping on it saying apple had something tried and true
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.520]   And why did they change it and in the end?
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:47.840]   We really like incremented changes to products that we already use big jumps cause us a whole bunch of
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:54.320]   Anxiety to that and so it's a difficult position for apple to be to be able to change enough to stay ahead
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:58.640]   Yet not be left behind at the same time and yeah, go ahead
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.960]   My personal thinking right now too is I don't think apple is the same company that could make that change
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:08.400]   Like the when the iPhone came out that was that big turnaround like oh my god apple's making a phone
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.560]   It's probably gonna kill the iPod in the process and they knew it was gonna kill the iPod
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.560]   But they did it anyway. I don't
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.040]   That's it's not the same company anymore. Like I don't think the visionaries
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:24.400]   Around apple right now are there to really make those sorts of decisions. So that's the bigger problem
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.920]   I agree with you and every time I say that people say what's the most valuable company in the world one analyst has now said they've raised
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.560]   Their uh, they say
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:37.280]   They've raised their prediction for apple stock. They say I can't believe you could even say this in this day and age
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:44.080]   That apple is one of the most underappreciated stocks in the world. This is brian right a wall street analyst
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:50.160]   It's a buying opportunity. It's the most apple is among the most underappreciated stocks in the world
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:57.680]   He thinks apple's gonna be a trillion dollar company over the next 12 months and their stock price will will break 200 dollars
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:04.400]   Yeah, and the shareholders would would lose it if they did something really wild and crazy and that's the problem
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:10.240]   That kind of success means there's no pressure on you to do anything right. Just keep doing what you're doing
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.040]   No, don't chit and move don't mess with it
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:18.800]   My big worry for apple right now is to become you know bomber era microsoft because
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:22.640]   They kept you know, they kept he kept everything going like
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:31.200]   Sales for windows and office and everything grew and they got you know that was pure focusing on the stock performance and less about the innovation
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.920]   And it took like a whole new ceo and it took a complete
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:41.600]   Changing of the guard to really reshift what microsoft is doing and then you look at the the devices coming out now like the surface laptop
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:45.760]   The surface pro are far more interesting than any of the laptops
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.080]   That thing is the best thing ever nice. I love this thing
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:57.360]   We're living in a topsy turvy world where microsoft is being more innovative than apple. It's really strange. Yeah, I had a great conversation
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.920]   With the watch though. They did like they're coming the watch Georgia. Come on
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:06.880]   This is not a pro this is not any other company had the apple watch except for apple
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:12.400]   You'd be talking about how this was a huge massive success. It's only because in comparison to the iphone
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.920]   It's nothing if any other company come up with the apple watch besides apple
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.400]   They'd be out of business. The only reason this is a success is because of all you sheeple
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:24.480]   How can you say that about sheeple while you wear your wapples?
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:29.200]   I'm not just wearing the apple watch. I'm wearing the ceramic one. I spent a lot of money on this
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.440]   Yeah, what are you doing? I'm a sheeple
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:37.520]   But it really is true. I think it really is true that this would not be a
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:44.720]   Successful product had anybody else done it, but because apple did it really another companies to do it and everybody else's smart watches
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.360]   They're all a business and right where we're yeah, jawbone is changing its business entirely
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:54.320]   Yeah, job one doesn't yeah, they're not gonna exist anymore. They're they're it's all medical devices now
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:57:00.720]   But yeah, I bought an apple watch. I bought an apple watch and every day I look at it and I just get angrier like
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:05.120]   Yeah, because they haven't really done much with it either like apple
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:11.280]   Has gotten better, but yeah, but you got me any mouse on it and Mickey mouse on it. That's good. I really enjoy yeah
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.840]   Tapping his foot
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.120]   Do you you're still doing fitness bands Jill? Do you still covering that beat?
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:24.000]   Not not as much it was a little bit difficult to do from overseas. Um, I did a handful of things actually
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.160]   I brought this over just in case anybody wanted to see something fun that I did do
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.440]   When you guys were all getting hats, I went and I grabbed my helmet
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:38.560]   This is the bicycle helmet called chorus that has um some speakers built into it that use bone conduction technology
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.840]   So instead of having your head your ears
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:47.440]   Silence to traffic noise you can hear while this conducts through your cheekbones
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.160]   Or phone calls or whatever the problem with it is it's a little heavy
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:58.000]   So it's got on the back. There's like a battery and everything and some rechargeable ports who makes them again
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:02.960]   It's called chorus the core. I don't remember the whole name of the helmet, but it's car
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.120]   How much is it?
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:11.520]   It's the links the chorus link smart helmet about 250 bucks. Is that about right 200?
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.480]   Yes 200 bucks
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.000]   Um, so what?
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.840]   Wireless they connects to your smartphone and then bone see yeah
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.880]   I remember bone conduction when I was a kid
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.360]   Uh that you'd put that thing around your neck remember the bone phone. Do you guys remember that?
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.520]   Oh
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.480]   You don't remember the song even none of you were even born when the bone phone came out
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.280]   Maybe it was the name
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.440]   I think that made it fail. Yeah
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:47.600]   Um, let me see this is uh, this was a fabric. Okay. Here's the ad
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.240]   Uh fabric covered tube
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.240]   So by radio shack. She doesn't look real happy
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.040]   F instead of oh yeah, well
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   Yeah, uh, this is
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:06.000]   So this was you know the tiley touted as using bone conduction the sound transfers into your body
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.120]   It was terrible
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:14.160]   I'm surprised. Uh, anyway, it feels like whatever it's coming back now
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.240]   Yeah, so I mean the funny thing is when you actually have it on
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:26.000]   The you can just hear it like it's a little speaker. Yeah, it doesn't feel and you just don't want to be smashing this against your face
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Yeah, but um, but yeah other other than that. It's a nice helmet
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.840]   It's just that people who are serious cyclists. They care very much about every ounce wait
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:38.960]   That they're by and yeah, this is a little bit heavy. It's about three times as heavy as like a racing helmet
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.880]   Yeah, don't be don't be about getting hit
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.600]   That's why I wear my sunflower. Oh
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.800]   It's really effective
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:51.040]   It has on it that one special feature it has is when it detects an impact
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:58.480]   It has a feature where it gives you like 30 30 to 60 seconds and then your phone will immediately send a message to
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:04.960]   Genc contact of your choice saying that i've detected it back here to person's gp. It's not moving. It's not moving
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.760]   So doesn't help you before the impact
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.440]   But once you you're lying there, it lets everyone else know
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.680]   Share with us. Shame. What is that a goldfish? What is that on your head?
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.680]   It's a magic harp. It's a pokemon
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.120]   Oh
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:25.040]   It's your magic harp. It's a pokemon. Yeah, it's kind of weird because the carp is actually swallowing your head, but
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.760]   It's it's hungry. It's starving. That's a magic harp. I recognize it now
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.120]   It's a magic harp. Yeah, it's the one-year anniversary of pokemon go
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.920]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.320]   Uh, I should take this off because I want to talk seriously about our sponsor right now
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.720]   Your sponsor wouldn't be happy. I think i'm as good as it is. Maybe they would love it
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.800]   You might get more views if you're wearing
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.640]   The whole world's turned into a snapchat filter
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.520]   The audio only listeners
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:58.800]   Yo is right now looking like the center of a daisy and he's got these
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.320]   daisy petals radiating from around his little face
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.280]   Say you're a daisy if you do you're a daisy if you do
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.840]   All right, that's just disturbing
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.520]   I've got children in the audience. I can't do that. All right. I showed today brought to we'll have more with our great panel
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.400]   I showed today brought to you by word press.com. That's where I hang my hat
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.600]   Oh, that was a good idea. I should make a blog
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.520]   For all my hats the hat leo's hat blog because I have hundreds of them including that daisy hat

[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.280]   Ah
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:41.840]   So google doesn't interesting thing google plans to do they want to release 20 million bacteria infected mosquitoes and fresno
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.080]   But don't it's not what you think it is. This is from lai. What is it live?
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.520]   Verily
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.080]   V-e-r-i-l-y is the life sciences arm under the alphabet umbrella
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:57.600]   And apparently we're starting to see some zika virus in fresno, california a jip die
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.680]   mosquito
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.640]   and
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.920]   So
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.480]   They've come up with this plan. They call it. I love the name the debug project
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   Uh by releasing
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:15.840]   Mosquitoes infected with a bacteria called wall Batchia, which is completely harmless to humans
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.240]   but when those mosquitoes mate with
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.040]   The egypti mosquitoes
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.880]   They infect them and their eggs cannot produce offspring and it's a way of basically killing off
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.560]   These mosquitoes and of course male mosquitoes don't bite
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.840]   So now not only do you not have zika, you don't get mosquito bites anywhere
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.440]   Uh, they haven't done it yet. No word from how much it will cost
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.120]   Uh, and I you know, it's interesting because this is pure public service. I don't think there's any way to make money on this
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.880]   Uh, they plan to do it in australia. They told the mit technology review. They plan to do something similar in australia
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.720]   next
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.560]   They want to yeah, this I guess this will happen. Let's see this article
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:02.640]   Uh is in tech crunch on july 14th and they say so I guess it will happen this coming week
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:09.920]   1 million mosquitoes over a 20 week period in 2 300 area nay acre nary neighborhoods in the fresno area
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.680]   Huh
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:18.000]   Why does ferrally do this is there a way to make money on this or is it just good?
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.080]   Right. Google's currencies data like this will teach them a lot about deploying similar things in the future
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:30.000]   And we've actually I think i've heard about not the exact same thing but other methods of like trying to
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.880]   Wipe out these econvected mosquitoes by using you know other other species or other ways to like
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.240]   Make their mating kind of you know, but kill off whatever is there. That's very cool
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.640]   Yeah, and google didn't didn't actually they didn't like do the research for this
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:52.240]   They're just using research that other people have done. We've uh done the same thing to try to get rid of dengue fever
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.400]   um and
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.760]   I don't know how to pronounce some of the other virus against that
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.200]   Transmit sigma yes chicken go in yeah
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:09.120]   So chicken go in your dengue and zika are all carried by the same type of mosquito whereas malaria is carried by a different type of mosquito
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:16.560]   We gotta just kill all the mosquitoes. I think there's no reason why mosquitoes is there any justification for mosquitoes to exist
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:24.160]   So I I'm one of these skeptics on this that there've been some people who say mosquitoes are not like a keystone
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.200]   Species if you kill them no other species will die off
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:35.280]   Because that's always that's always the worry right are there other species that feed on this particular bats and birds eats mosquitoes
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.480]   Right, but we really don't know where else
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.320]   I mean, it's just such a hard thing to study. Yeah, right like the
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:48.400]   The ecosystem does not lend itself well to the kind of typical scientific studies
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.720]   We do where we isolate one or two things and we you know use controls because it's such a web of stuff
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:01.680]   So you don't know until you start to see the outcomes and the other thing with using these sort of
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.160]   In fertility type of tactics is they're not a hundred percent
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.960]   So if you release male mosquitoes that are infected with bacteria into an environment
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.840]   And they mate with the females and the female eggs are no longer viable
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.040]   That will take care of a good number of mosquitoes, but it's not going to kill off the entire population
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.640]   So does it does it die out? Does it dip?
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.680]   If it dips, how long does it dip if they come back do they come back more resilient?
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:36.720]   You know, which of which of the animals survive it's there's just so many questions that you're right. I take it back
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.680]   You're absolutely very hesitant. So I'm glad that they're just testing on a little population like fresno
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.400]   Well, omega project says next summer will have a story about 20 million bats being released in the fresno area to control the
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.880]   The out of control
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:56.160]   Mosquito population and when you have to bear to kill off a last one you just wait till it's winter
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:03.840]   You're absolutely right. This is very human. This godlike thing. Oh, you know, just get rid of mosquitoes. What what good could they possibly be?
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.080]   Uh, so there's any creature that has wiped us out as efficiently
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:13.440]   Besides ourselves as mosquitoes or rats rats are not great. Don't like the rats
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.760]   It's not the rats. It's not the rats. It's the fleas on the rats fleas that are on the rats. So
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.160]   The rats are innocent. Well, they're not they're not innocent
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.360]   They're complicit
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.560]   Do you think that they
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.600]   It shows they chose to they're like us. They're unindicted coke conspirators is what they are
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.200]   Amas let's talk about amazon a little bit
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:44.720]   According to a story that came out this morning, uh, the verge had it and others had it their amazon is reportedly working on a messaging app called anytime
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.960]   you know, obviously jumping on the the ridiculous
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:56.880]   Gap left by both apple and google apples messages, which is perfectly good only works on apple hardware
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.600]   So that leaves out a lot of the world
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.840]   And google just can't seem to make up its mind on messaging in any reasonable way that they they took sms out of
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:12.720]   Hangouts for people except everybody using google phy they they have multiple messengers
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:20.960]   No one knows what google's strategy is so amazon. I think amazon smart amazon clearly sees an opportunity. This is uh,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:29.680]   Anytime is a all-in-one feature rich service that could rival social networks with a focus on messaging voice and video calls
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:36.800]   Photo sharing you can apply filters. Of course you couldn't release you couldn't release a photo sharing app without filters
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:43.440]   Um, and this is an interesting quote from the graphic. This came from af tv news
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.880]   Everyone's on it reach all your friends just using their name. No numbers needed
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.360]   i'm trying to read between the tea leaves here between the lines because
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.080]   Uh, what i'd love to see amazon do is release an sms app that i could use
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.760]   For sms messaging on an android device you're stuck unfortunately with apple's messages on ios
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.560]   Uh, and then they say they'll do it on desktop android ios
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:13.120]   So you could use it everywhere, but if they don't use phone numbers, it sounds like they won't support sms
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.480]   What do you think? How could they do that?
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.800]   They will have in default encryption strong encryption built in
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.080]   Uh, they'll have it is it it is interesting that there has been no one
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:34.800]   successor in the in the text messaging and messaging space because it's been around
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:41.120]   Really since the beginning of the popularity of the internet right like if you look at just even instant messaging
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:48.400]   Um, and i would say that the closest contender right now is probably facebook messenger because it does eliminate that need for
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.800]   A specific phone number you can look somebody up just by but being friends with them
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.800]   They have to be on facebook
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:02.080]   They have to be on facebook. Yes, but i think i think right now it is probably the leader that i've seen like what's app is kind of
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.960]   Died out a little bit and some of the other ones that have been popular like, um
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:13.520]   Like line and then there was wicker and there was all these i think amazon's looking at line and we chat in china
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.320]   Because those are
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.760]   Much more than just messaging their platforms you can buy stuff you can
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:26.800]   Uh, i mean you can and i think amazon's is thinking i mean obviously amazon's interest and this is that you could shop on it
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.520]   So i think they're they're gonna try to create a week
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:37.680]   But you've got it you've got to get in there first right so like the the way that you get in with apple users is that people have
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:43.120]   iPhones and we already talked in this episode about how successful the iphone has been from a sales point of view
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.400]   And if you have people who are signed up to facebook well then you have this automatic messaging system included
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:55.040]   So but what's gonna be the way to get those amazon users to start adopting this new app
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.480]   I mean it's not going to be just having an amazon account right because a lot of people don't use it on their mobile device or
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.960]   They're not thinking about it as a communication tool. Whereas with an iphone
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:11.280]   And facebook you're already thinking about it as a communication tool. So what's going to be their in road? Well, it's going to be their hook
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.680]   Yeah, i mean amazon does have quite a bit of a social graph like they haven't really done much with it
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.200]   You what if you could call echoes with it? Yeah, yeah
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.080]   That could be a thing. Yeah, what if you could use your echo to message that would be nice
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.640]   That would be
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.680]   That was coming out as a future echo to echo calls echo to echo is
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:37.280]   But see now I could have any time on my phone is my messaging app and messaging echo
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.400]   Somebody's echo like it was there like it was there land also in this uh in this
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:51.200]   Cell window new ways to hang out share your location. Okay. Everybody does that listen to music order food together split a bill
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.760]   Chat with businesses get super service on your terms make reservations
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.480]   Check on your orders even shop. So that's a really interesting question though, Jill
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.480]   What would what would amazon have to do to make this ubiquitous and do they first of all do they need to make it ubiquitous?
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.640]   But second what would they do to really?
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.280]   improve the uptake of this
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:17.760]   How do you get you're not gonna you're not gonna get a mass adoption of people installing a new app?
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.000]   I don't think right not that's apples advantage because it comes it is just
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.840]   Something yeah, it's just right. It's already it's got to be something that's already being used among amazon
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.360]   Apple would make a android version of messages and a they already have a desktop version on mac
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.800]   But make one for windows. I think messages could win this right? They don't seem to want to
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.280]   It depends. I guess like a
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.960]   In all of the way we're talking about this too like if amazon integrated something like this right into the amazon shopping app
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.480]   That could be interesting because everybody's got that
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.000]   Everyone's got that you can see your friends wishlist and things like that
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.800]   That would be a fundamental change in the way we handle amazon shopping and what that app could do but
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.680]   And you make deals you go out and you make deals with care with cell phone manufacturers and carriers to put that app on the phone
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.200]   Make it the default app amazon's got the money they could do that
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.320]   Well, we've already done that with amazon shopping a lot of phones come with amazon even a bunto
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.960]   Linux comes with an amazon app
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.680]   Yeah, but where
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:29.440]   I think the chill is right. There's not really a really a great catch. It's not fun and trendy like snapchat is with great privacy and a
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.600]   breakdancing hot dog
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.680]   Um, you know, it's not already installed which is what apple's gonna be able to deal with and so everyone's gonna use that
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.960]   and amazon primarily people are thinking about, you know
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.960]   Shopping and dealing with things like maybe if they gave you bonuses you got prime if you were using it
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.360]   I don't know
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.560]   They would have to have something that would make a difference in people's lives to be able to have that barrier to entry that I
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.200]   Want to get it because I want this right?
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.320]   I would hate to bet against you. I would be I would get it right that would be it
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.720]   Well, you gotta believe they're gonna try step. I just feel like I would hate to bet against amazon
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.520]   They are seriously on a roll prime day
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.520]   Which is a joke
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.160]   Because there's no it's it's not really deals
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.520]   It's as good. You know, it's like going to a costco or
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:22.320]   You know a big box store to get deals. It's more the appearance of deals, but it was at the amazon garage sale
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.280]   Yeah, but you know wire cutter does this analysis and of several thousand deals
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.720]   A handful were actually deals. Let me go to wire cutter and show you the actual numbers
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:37.920]   I mean it would so it's not a really great place to get deals. However, it's very successful
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:45.440]   They they had uh, it was the biggest prime day in its history up 60 over the year before
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.840]   Number one seller was the echo
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.560]   Uh, imagine that
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.160]   Yeah
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.080]   Yeah, I hate to bet against amazon. I think if amazon did a met I would look at it
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.320]   I I think there's a gap. Well, I just think there's a gap in messaging
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.360]   Well, no, but I mean, okay. So here's the thing for me
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.480]   uh, the nice thing on android is you can use
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:13.840]   Uh other apps as your sms app you can say I want FaceTime messenger to be my sms app and sms
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.800]   Text messages through the carrier will come in there
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:24.240]   So I could make if I can make anytime my sms app I absolutely would especially if they if I could order stuff through that
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.640]   I think it's not gonna be hard for them to convince at least prime users
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:33.360]   To do that. I think if any other company were to try to get into the space
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:42.160]   It would be less interesting, but the idea that yeah, amazon could actually give you deals or maybe give you a little bonus to your prime account or something like that
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.960]   Uh, this seems more like a logistics play than just straight up messaging
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.320]   Right if they end up being the one place you go to talk to your friends
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.760]   But also to order food and to share payments and do things like that like there's a lot of potential there
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.800]   Like even food ordering right now is a really splintered market
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.160]   Um, you know seamless and grub hub did uh, merge so there one thing right now, but you
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.760]   There they don't dominate everywhere in america
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.800]   Um, so you go different places you'll have to use different services
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.760]   Amazon is a logistics company at this point, right? They're tied directly into our lives just
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:19.760]   On based on getting us stuff and now they're getting us stuff faster and faster
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.040]   Um, and you get we have instant delivery now
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.600]   So I could see this being like a really useful
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.440]   You know a useful chat app that could tie into things
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.040]   I know better
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.360]   My argument is amazon's reached critical mass
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:41.040]   Yeah, and now it's almost that anything they launch is going to because of the size of amazon and the devoted amazon customer
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.480]   It's going to be a success out of the gate as long as it's not like crazy hardware like the fire phone or something, right?
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   This is
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.120]   Yeah
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:58.320]   Fire tablets amazon music amazon storage like they they have some secret good stuff like amazon web services
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:04.800]   Is amazing and being used by everybody and is pulling in all kinds of money that we'll never know about because they don't break out the numbers
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.920]   In any of the reports, but I think the companies have lots of little weak flops
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.320]   But it they look like nothing
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.360]   Fire tablets flops by the way the fire tablets like as far as
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:21.040]   Decent cheap android tablets like they're actually a far better than most of the other options out there
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.560]   They're like the one
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.080]   The one successful android tablet at this point like the last ones remaining
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:33.440]   I think that if I had like a wishlist of all of my friends on amazon and I knew like oh leah is looking for a floating
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.640]   Bonsai tree
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.480]   Um, and I could then order it for him and get it sent to his house as a gift
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:43.680]   That would be kind of cool and neat to be able to network that way without them knowing that I bought it for them
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.440]   That might be something that would be kind of different that they could do but
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.200]   This is completely side
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:56.240]   Point, but what is what is jeff doing these days? He's have you been to the gym jeff?
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:03.520]   Is that so this is jeff before and after jeff bays us on the left classic nerd geeky guy
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:06.320]   Now he's looked like vindiesel
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.280]   What the hell in fact it's becoming a whole internet meme have you seen all these the yep
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.280]   [laughs]
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.640]   Here he is with the rock and vindiesel that that's a crew you'd stay away from
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.040]   holy cow
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.040]   What is going on with
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.720]   The terminator
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:34.480]   All right, I uh, yeah, he's looking good. He's lifting. Yeah. Yeah
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:38.640]   1998 on the left 2017 on the right
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.160]   It just gives me hope that's all I'm saying
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:50.000]   There's there's there's something there's something ahead for me. Here's another uh measure of the power of the baysos
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.040]   uh
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:56.640]   Amazon announced a geek squad competitor best buy lost a billion dollars in its stock stock value
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:04.480]   When and this was just this wasn't even an announcement recode reported that amazon was quietly building out a geek squad
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.760]   Here's the graph of best by stock price
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.760]   [laughs]
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.400]   That's the power
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.920]   That's the power
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.920]   All right, let's take a little break divindra hardwars here from vengadget senior editor

[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.080]   It's great to have you on georgia our show today brought to you actually before we do that
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.640]   Let's take a look at that. We made a little promo video
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.840]   Uh, so that for those of you who never watch any of our other shows could see what you're missing watch
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:41.840]   Previously on twit. I did bring something with me and I set off the metal detector. Oh, this is amazing. It was a gong
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.720]   Not a gun. It's a gong. I brought it with
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.360]   They were wondering with the gong
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:52.240]   Windows weekly you'll notice that we don't always ship everything that goes to insiders
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:56.000]   And a lot of it is because they didn't test what many of our insiders are able to represent
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.880]   The people they help day-to-day because people say oh, yeah, I love this feature. It's awesome
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.320]   But it's going to be very hard for people who I support to use
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:12.720]   Security now there was a lawsuit which was accusing facebook of tracking users web browsing activity
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.160]   Even after they logged out however
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:23.600]   US district judge in san jose california dismissed the case because he said that the plaintiffs failed the show
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:29.840]   They had a reasonable expectation of privacy or that they suffered any realistic
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.400]   Comic harm or loss. I'm happy to see that this didn't go any further
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:41.840]   You know these people just need to know how the internet works twit for help with the technology addiction problem call 1-800 twit
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.680]   Thank you. How did how did you not come to wear the right shirt today?
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:51.760]   I didn't get the memo mega moroni. What's ahead?
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:59.200]   There's another mesh networking game in town this week. Samsung is set to release its connect home smart Wi-Fi system
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:06.080]   It has a smart things hub built in and will sell for a hundred and seventy dollars or three hundred and eighty dollars for a pack of three
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:11.840]   The Wi-Fi network has been available in select locations all month, but will release nationwide on july 16th
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:18.000]   We expect several high profile tech companies to release quarterly earnings this week including Netflix
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:26.080]   IBM microsoft qualcomm t-mobile and ebay and finally san diego comic con happens this week
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:36.000]   Costume to comic book and movie fans will descend on the city in droves order says many outlets including the walking dead have decided not to throw pricey parties this year
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.200]   But much fun and cosplay will still be had at least for those of us watching from instagram
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:46.880]   Those are just a few of the stories that jason howl and i will be following this week on tech news today
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.280]   Every weekday monday through friday at four p.m pacific. We'll see you there
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.960]   Thank you mega moroni. Have you gone to comic con?
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:02.560]   No, I wish I was really my brother's icon. Oh, yeah, no
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.840]   It's its pure madness, but sort of it is the best like crazy big convention
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:13.680]   Just to have her go to really I think it's okay that the big brands like the walking dead and stuff kind of
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:21.040]   Don't go. I know everybody likes to see their favorite stars on stage and stuff, but I hate I hate when corporate influences
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.720]   Something that's really grassroots like that. I don't know. That's just meaning
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:29.120]   And when I was going there was when the movie studios were really big into it
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:33.440]   And they've kind of stepped back over the past few years and I hear people just have more fun there now, but
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.680]   It yeah, some of those moments seeing like the first trailer for
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:44.080]   That's pretty glimpses at the adventures or something like yeah, that was that's the way they brought the bba down stage for the first time
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.720]   That's cool stuff. Yeah
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.960]   I like cosplay players
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:56.000]   You know, I have mixed feelings. You could go you could go wearing the hat. I don't think grown-up should put
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.640]   costumes on
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:03.520]   And actually like that. I just think that that's kind of childish too short
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.480]   Juvenile there. Yeah, we need to be a little bit more silly
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.640]   No, I think it's no you're I can't take you seriously though when you're in the hat
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.120]   Infantilization
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:21.360]   Of america. It's more than it's like that star wars hotel
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.680]   It's just we're all just turning into wallie
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:29.280]   more joy and laughter and people need to take things a little bit less seriously and
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.440]   I think that the world would be a better place ships with a giant slurp
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.480]   You with that hat on I know I'm a sunny daisy
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:40.160]   Jill Duffy's going why did I agree to this show?
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:47.040]   I'm with georgia on this one. I'm all about like play is an essential part of like
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:53.520]   life in the same way that like our freedoms for food and sex and all kinds of stuff are
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:59.280]   important to our vitality and I think I'm really happy about the amount of adult play
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.240]   and I'm non-sexual but like adult play opportunities that now exists
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.560]   You know like grown up
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:12.240]   There's all these grown-up gay camps now where you can go to gay summer camp and just hang out in a safe place in the woods and
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:19.200]   swim and chupo as in arrows and I don't know there's and just that video games are
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.720]   Finally accepted as kind of an art form that adults are allowed to engage in
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:31.280]   And star wars themed stuff and my sister took her kids to the Harry Potter world recently and I think
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.720]   That I love just as much fun there
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.480]   That I love
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.280]   No, I'm all in on the embrace play
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.560]   About eight butter beers and went on the ride and threw it up. It was awesome
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:51.440]   Sold and marketed either, you know, it can be it can be invented
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.880]   It can be boredom
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.080]   It can be sitting around in a park inventing a game on your own
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:02.000]   But I'm I'm absolutely like a proponent of that and against this age is on bullsh*t Leo that once you get older
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.800]   I'm just old I'm old
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.280]   And that age is I'm old
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.240]   Our show today brought to you by stan proud of it. I'm wearing a freaking bow tie

[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.040]   Cheese wheel on I think they meant body
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.240]   Instead of table
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.240]   He's great in the cheese. He's great in cheese

[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:19.040]   My handy design
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:22.320]   Mostly they're gonna be more popular now than they would have been
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:28.080]   Beforehand. I'm just saying I'm just saying I'm just saying if you could get cheese
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.440]   Cheese wheel on a body instead of a table. Why wouldn't you?
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.800]   Okay
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.320]   Moving along I kind of feel like everything after that's gonna be a letdown
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:49.680]   Um
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.040]   Twitter lets you avoid trolls trolls by muting new users and strangers who cares I couldn't care less free speech groups
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:06.000]   Well, you know because everyone's so nice on twitter useful is it useful that you use that because I feel like then they're still there
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.520]   They're still spewing. They just you're not seeing it. It's like it's fine. That's like an ostrich
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.160]   Is you're putting your head in the sand saying you can't see me now, can you?
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:16.480]   For your mental health. I think it's great
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:22.800]   I've taken to muting people who tend to be obnoxious in my timeline rather than blocking them because the block is the win for them
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:28.560]   Right didn't know you blocked them. Right. Yeah, right. They got to you. I don't have enough followers to really have to do
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:32.000]   Yeah
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:39.680]   Think about this case coming out of I think it's being funded by the night foundation and some relationship to columbia university
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:45.360]   Where users are suing donald trump for for him blocking them saying that it's
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:52.160]   That twitter is being used as a public channel for official news and
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:55.120]   It's an interesting story, isn't it?
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.720]   It's a it's kind of an interesting story
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:00.640]   But I also feel like if you log out of twitter, can't you just see his feet anyway?
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:06.880]   No, but what they're saying is you're impeding our speech because we can no longer tweak anything
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.600]   Yeah, I don't know I
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:15.920]   I don't know. I think it's a super interesting case, but I don't I don't feel like I personally have a good clear graph
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.560]   on how it's gonna go in court
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:24.480]   I can't wait though. I've got to know it's his twitter account. That's his it's not pothos
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.120]   It's yeah, he's on twitter account, which I think gives him a certain amount of the way to be able to
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.920]   Highest office in the yeah
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.920]   Now understand the first amendment
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:40.320]   Make a official announcement the first amendment doesn't protect you if you know you can't use the first amendment argument to say well twitter
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:45.840]   Can't block me but if the government blocks you you have a first amendment right to speak to the guy
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.640]   If the government blocks you that violates the first amendment. Yeah, there's a couple of questions here
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:56.240]   Part is that because he uses that to to actually show policy, that's where he may be in trouble
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.560]   I think that if he just uses says his private account
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:04.320]   I think that he would have been fine to be able to block whomever he so choose chooses because he's not using that for work
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:10.640]   But where they may end up saying is because he does use this for actual policy and and talking about different policies
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:17.200]   He may you know, this might become one of these things of being a public forum where everyone should be able to have a say
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:20.000]   it probably like this the
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.640]   This legal like move probably won't go anywhere
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.080]   But the fact that they're doing it and can bring this up because this is a good point
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.800]   Like he is using this as a platform and he's silencing americans by blocking them
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.280]   Uh, it would be a totally different story if it was the official pothos account for sure though. Yeah
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:38.880]   It's fascinating it really is
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.640]   Um
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:47.440]   They the white house has said you in fact, Sean spicer said trump's tweets are quote official statements by the president of the united states end quote
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.680]   Mm-hmm
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:56.480]   You mean they he said something in the past. It's incriminated them fruit. You know the future never happened before with this man
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:03.840]   It's uh, it's also a sad commentary on where where what twitter and general and and
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.560]   What's happening in the world and at large is so is so ridiculous
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.200]   That who would have ever thought 20 years ago? This would we would be debating
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:22.880]   Well, can the president block people from it? What is twitter account? You know my favorite my favorite kind of um twist in this whole saga is that before
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.680]   the presidential campaign
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.480]   Really got underway in
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:35.040]   20 early 2017, I guess um everybody was talking about twitter and the death now like twitter is over
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:39.200]   Nobody's using twitter twitter is not growing anymore. Twitter has no way to make money
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:43.280]   Yes
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:50.160]   Exactly, but nobody's really telling that story like we all just sort of forgot that twitter was supposed to be dead by now
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:52.400]   Yeah, well, I think like
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:57.920]   I think philosophically like we still don't know twitter is they're still trying to figure out their business like all those problems are still there
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.000]   It's just a very popular platform for you know one guy right now
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:08.160]   There's also the question of if the president tweets and then deletes it is he deleting
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:14.800]   Uh government records, you know, you're not supposed to as president. You're not supposed to delete your emails. You're not supposed to these records are public
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:17.440]   public property
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.440]   But isn't there there's a
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.760]   Well, their answer to that was that they're keeping them all the white house says
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:30.480]   Which and you know, this is complete BS, but the but the way I said something like oh no, we've got we've got a technique that keeps them all
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.760]   Like you know, that's they know they just made that up
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.400]   But anyway
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:41.840]   Uh, does at potus block people or so you're saying it's only at the real donald trump that blocks people not
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.920]   I don't think he has he's not the only one with access to at potus. So I
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.280]   I heard that this was just for his personal
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:55.040]   Yeah, and I hear that there's um, there's some organization. That's actually saving all the Donald Trump's
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:02.080]   Even if they are deleted so but that's not the point the point is they're not the white house is not supposed to delete anything. No
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.480]   Um, nobody ever sued over that. There's that was pointed out
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:12.960]   Six major us airports now scan americans faces when they leave the country. Oh, isn't that nice?
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.720]   Um
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.600]   You're in a database if you leave the country
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:28.080]   The department of homeland security has been pushing a plan that if enacted require all americans submit to a facial recognition scan when leaving the country
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.680]   Uh, the the original law was to track
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.560]   international visitors foreigners
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:43.040]   But the facial scanning pilot programs are already underway at boston chicago houston at lana, new york city and dc
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:52.640]   In a recent privacy assessment the department of homeland security said quote the only way for an individual to ensure he or she
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.400]   Is not subject to collection of biometric information
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.840]   When traveling internationally is to
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:03.120]   Refrain refrain from travel
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:09.440]   God lord, I mean is I don't I guess travel is not a privilege. Although
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.200]   It seems to go away from human rights and freedoms to be able to
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.920]   Yeah
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.160]   It's not your base has been collected when you get a passport. Yeah, that's true
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.640]   Right now you're in a larger
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.120]   Yeah, do they put that in a database? I don't know but now you are in a larger electronic database
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:38.240]   Uh, and the point is it's not just uh internet, you know, we know that you foreigners have no protection at all. Sorry
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.960]   You're out of luck, but uh
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:46.720]   If the photograph captured at a boarding is matched to a us citizen passport
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.800]   The uh dhs says we discarded after a short period of time
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:58.960]   I don't know that's just uh, it seems intrusive, but what the hell, you know
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:05.280]   And then what happens if something happens and you end up with like facial surgery or I fall down and you know
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:09.440]   It might not have to georgi-dows
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.920]   There will now be two georgi-dows in the world
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.360]   Right
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:19.120]   There's some things that happen with facial recognition though, right? Like I mean, it's not just it's not just matching your
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:25.040]   Like the topography of your face. It's matched. It's measuring things like the distance between your eyes
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.640]   and
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.560]   Right all kinds of very detailed stuff that I think if you wear makeup or change
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.280]   Since you know, pluck your eyebrows or whatever
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.600]   It's not gonna it's not gonna throw it off
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.520]   And there's some really neat stuff that's going on in the sort of biometric security
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:46.240]   Area right like with the life-ness of the face. There's a company that does something where um
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:50.160]   There there's solution I can't remember the name of the company
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:57.440]   But there's solution basically was one that said you can't spoof it with a photograph because we're we're looking for quote-unquote life-ness
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:01.920]   You need a video instead of a photograph
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.560]   Did any of you do anything on wednesday for uh save the internet day?
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.520]   Do you have a birthday cake or anything?
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.440]   We went black and white for the day just our stream was black and white which I yeah
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:22.720]   And we put a link on our website and on the shows encourage people to go to battle for the net.com and to most importantly write or call your member of congress and say
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.280]   We're in favor of an open internet apparently atnt is also in favor of an open internet
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:34.160]   Which surprised me because uh, I think atnt Comcast and Verizon are widely considered as the three villains
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.960]   in uh, the net neutrality saga they would love to charge extra
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:43.920]   For uh, netflix to get to you and so forth. They don't believe all bits should be equal
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:50.480]   So atnt surprised everybody when they announced oh no, we're in favor of net neutrality in fact. This is an article in the verge
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.920]   Uh
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:57.040]   Somebody tweeted niele patel with this picture this screenshot from his direct tv
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:03.280]   Look at that right there on the on the tv it says atnt supports the uh open internet and here it says
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.800]   atnt supports an open internet tell congress to protect your internet by adapting lasting rules
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.440]   So they really atnt you're in favor of this huh?
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:17.840]   So if you go to their website, they offer some canned messages you can send to your member of congress
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.720]   And by the way, you include your name phone number and address which I imagine atnt is harvesting
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:28.640]   And you're not able to edit these messages. So you have to send them out as atnt wants read them carefully
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.400]   For instance, I agree with the fcc
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:36.880]   It doesn't make sense to apply an 80 year old regulatory scheme to the internet
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.600]   There is a right way and a wrong way to preserve the concept of an open internet
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:45.120]   I'm in favor of protecting the open internet with legislation
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:49.760]   In other words, this is all about 18 at atnt saying
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:57.760]   sneakily tricking its customers into lobbying its congressmen to go ahead with agitpies
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:02.560]   Decision to abandon title 2 regulation of the internet
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:08.240]   While I support the fcc's work to get rid of the rules that were harming the internet economy
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:14.640]   Really they're harming the internet economy. They're harming atnt's economy. I'll grant you that
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.200]   I believe the only way to permanently guarantee an open internet is by congress creating a law
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:22.560]   So a nice try atnt but
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.640]   No
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.680]   I mean the idea open internet too like a lot of these companies do co-opt
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:34.480]   That idea right to some open internet means it yeah, no
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:41.840]   I remember when coal fire power plants put up conserve and conservation signs all over their lunchroom
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.600]   To just convince their employees. Oh, no, no, we're all for conservation
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.120]   We're all in favor of it. We love the environment
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:54.160]   Tom kess says clean coal is the thing calm kess says we're creating hysteria
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.880]   You know knock it off your
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:03.920]   Comcast vorajanans and centrally counter the day of action saying net neutrality supporters create hysteria
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:11.360]   It's all positive reversing the net neutrality regulation will do several positive things
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:15.120]   Increase customer choice if our bottom line
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:23.680]   Spare innovation and investment see they claim that hey if you if you do this, we're just not going to invest in any more internet
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.120]   Yeah
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:31.040]   Not and all of those government subsidies that they've benefited from right?
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.080]   Anyway, I don't I'm not gonna tell you what to think about it
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:40.240]   But read up on it and write your member of congress and tell them support ninja trolley
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:44.160]   I'll say it. I'll say it support it go on dial up for a day and see how happy you are
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:51.840]   Uh, well and frankly, I don't think you know sites like uh like mine and and and many of yours wouldn't exist
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.240]   If you had to pay a tariff to the internet service provider to access and users
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.040]   You know it
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.840]   We just need to say it you won't get your game of thrones so there
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:08.240]   That's just terrible and be able to just it's true. It's true. No game of thrones. So support net neutrality. There we go
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.000]   Microsoft did
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.160]   Not exactly the same time, but a similar time also put in its two cents
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:22.240]   They they want to create a rural airband initiative and they want to put 10 billion dollars in investment into it
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.680]   To bring internet to two million rural americans high speed internet
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:31.760]   This is the real problem is there very many people in in the in the countryside don't have access to broad bet true broad
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.840]   Uh, this is a this is I think a great idea. They're they're using the
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.600]   unused white space in television signals
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:46.240]   Uh to provide wireless internet targets initially will be 12 states, Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New York
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:48.400]   North Dakota, south Dakota, Texas
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.640]   Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.360]   Uh, and it's just the beginning
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.920]   Use that white space. That's one of many I think very good solutions to bring more broadband
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.040]   to everybody
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.760]   And it's sad to say but windows phone 8.1 is officially dead
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:11.600]   Oh man, this nobody saw this coming
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:16.960]   This headline really isn't fair because there's still windows phone 10
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.520]   But the windows phone 8.1 which actually was really great came out three years ago
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.800]   Um, but microsoft is ending support on that
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:33.280]   80 percent of this is so sad 80 percent of all windows powered phones are still running windows phone seven windows phone eight or windows phone 8.1
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:37.280]   They're now unsupported only 20 percent are running the latest windows 10
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.520]   That sounds like a lot but 20 percent of all the windows phones is really only seven or eight so
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.640]   Yeah
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.760]   They're down
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:57.120]   Uh, all right. Let me take a little break and uh, we'll end with good news like the world's first robot lawyer
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:03.120]   And then we're gonna wrap it up because it's getting perilously close
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:09.920]   To actually it's uh, it's not game of thrones time. It's pre pre gaming game of thrones time, right?
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:12.400]   What are you gonna do to pre game?
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:14.160]   David, are you gonna?
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:19.760]   You gonna eat dinner. That's uh dinner. That's good start. You never want to watch on an empty stomach. You don't want to be hungry
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:24.160]   Exactly and you don't want to be eating during the show. Well, yeah
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:28.080]   Okay, can I make a nice big bowl of buttery popcorn?
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:33.920]   It has not a butter might be you might you'll drew a butter everywhere and you won't give a fun enough
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.160]   Because you can't keep your eyes off the show you can eat you might choke on a husk
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:41.680]   It should be very good again for it. She'll really traumatize the danger
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.200]   but
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:46.080]   Effectively it was more of a visual thing
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:53.760]   Yeah to make it explicit that show is really gory and you might also cookies. Yeah, you don't want to you don't want to
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.960]   So maybe you should wait and eat after game of thrones
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:03.360]   I'm gonna eat before many pre game of thrones. So I'm all prepared. I have my shirt
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:10.320]   Um, I'm gonna be bringing down a little tiny dragon. Um, maybe a sword who knows you have to get rid of already
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:13.360]   You never know. I hope you'll wear your magic carp hat
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:19.680]   Do you think that that would be like all my magic carp cat if you wear your your um sunflower hat
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.600]   I got mine
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:24.880]   But I want a photo. I am the I am the boy with no name
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:28.560]   Magic carp hat alone and I feel silly doing it together feels better
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:35.440]   A daisy has no name
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.640]   you're
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.640]   wilting
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.640]   God, I'm wilting it's a wilting daisy. I know

[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.120]   She's going to get out of that. I think I'm doing it wrong
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:56.480]   It doesn't have the same
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:01.760]   I look like a sad babushka daisy like a swallow swallowed your head
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.560]   daisy swallowed my head
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.840]   There we go. Very good. You're the only one now. I got nothing. I have VR headsets
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:15.760]   Like I have a pile them, but that would make it really hard to do the show. Yeah, no, don't wear your VR
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.400]   Show in VR next time

[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:56.800]   Uh
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.840]   First my partner needs to learn to speak Romanian, but we're aiming for march march
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:07.360]   So that's actually a requirement that he asked him to speak Romanian. That's a hard language
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:13.040]   It's a romance language. So he has he has some french and italian so we're hoping that
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:19.920]   Um, it will actually not be too much. We keep joking that it's it's like speaking Italian with a russian accent
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.000]   Which is not at all true. It's just a joke
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:29.200]   Yeah, actually I was really excited because duo lingo just recently released romanian
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.680]   That's app though. I'm trying to pick up a little bit too
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:36.880]   But they send him to monoray or something to learn this the defense language institute because they have
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:41.760]   Uh in washington desor harlington. Yeah, arlington. Yeah
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:48.160]   Yeah, they have uh really high speed training for the diplomatic corps that they can get up to speed very quickly
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.520]   learn all the important things like no nukes
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:57.360]   Are uh, let's see nieelson on demand audio streaming at a record high
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.280]   It's up 62.4
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:04.080]   I think a lot of people saw this stat and said oh it's all spotify and and music
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:09.360]   But i'm not sure it is because that includes other forms of audio including podcasts
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.800]   Nieelson isn't breaking it down, but a big jump
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.520]   in on-demand audio
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.760]   62 percent year over year growth
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:23.840]   I know it could be you know 444. It could be uh kendrick lamar. It could be
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:30.000]   Ed sheeran, but I think it's twit. That's what i'm gonna say. That's my story and i'm sticking to it
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.920]   Are anybody going to black hat it's coming up this weekend in vegas
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.240]   No
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:42.960]   We uh, I don't I don't you know normally we send uh father robert ballisare. He's a jesuit priest and he's actually
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:46.240]   Uh made a vow of silence. So I don't think he can go
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.960]   Uh this is perfect
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:53.280]   Perfect candidate. Yeah, exactly never has to make a phone call
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:58.080]   Wouldn't that be interesting? I wonder if he's going can he I don't know if he's allowed to write
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:01.600]   I think he kind of has to he's supposed to like wander around and think deep thoughts
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:05.600]   He can't like go to vegas for how long is he gonna be silent for august
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:11.440]   All of august no no he he started last month. It's like a two or three months thing
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:17.920]   That is really impressive and if you're following him with on twitter he is tweeting, but he has got like a bot doing it
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:23.600]   Because he didn't want so even messaging would be not allowed. You can't do that. No, so I have a feeling
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:27.920]   I'm amazing. I wanted to go with silent retreat for like a few days. So I would like to do that. Yeah, I could you
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:34.080]   They do them down here. Um come come down here again. They have them in nocosio over at
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:39.120]   spirit rock and you wander around and you don't say anything and they have them all with you do
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:41.680]   Uh weekend a week two weeks
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:47.680]   It would be very i'm probably giggled though. I'd get in trouble. I'd probably be thrown out very hard for me not to talk for any length of time
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.120]   I can barely stop talking when you guys are talking
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:58.480]   Afthemler the afghan first robotics team an all-girl team that had been
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:01.280]   blocked from coming to the united states because
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:03.360]   terrorism
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.320]   President trump has granted them us visas
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:09.760]   They were they twice made the trek across
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:13.040]   Afghanistan facing serious danger
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:17.440]   To apply to their at their embassy and they couldn't at the embassy they couldn't do it
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:23.040]   But the white house has intervened at the same time as he's denying entrepreneur visas
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:27.520]   For anybody else who likes to come to the united states
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:33.360]   So but the but the but the girls got in and they're going to be allowed to compete. I think they're already here as a matter of fact
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.120]   um
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:40.800]   The competition is washington dc teams from 160 countries students from syria iran and sudan
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:44.880]   But apparently there's something about afghanistan. They just didn't like
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:50.000]   They they they they create a robot that sorts balls
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.360]   Took six months to build
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.360]   And and I think you really got to support
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:58.320]   I think it's great that they're coming to get us support them
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:02.480]   Their girls getting an education in afghanistan. That's not easy by itself
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:09.520]   Uh, they're doing technology. They're studying robotics good for them. Speaking of robotics the world's first robot lawyer
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:12.880]   He's
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:18.480]   Now available in all 50 states. I love this subhead at the verge free strongly worded letters
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:24.880]   Uh, if I don't you do I don't know if you trusted it's uh, but anyway
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.840]   It was this is the one that they used in the uk right to get you out of traffic tickets
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:33.360]   And do not pay remember
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:38.080]   And now uh, and now you can use it to fight moving violations here in the states
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:46.960]   Something something that's cool didn't say it was good. Just say it's doing it. Just said it's doing it
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:52.880]   Well, it'd probably be much cheaper. A lot of people cannot afford right have legal aids
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:58.800]   So I think that it's a good beginning point and we know that robots are actually better at diagnosing many illnesses. So
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:07.280]   Could be better one movie that will be at kamakan and a good thing. Steven spielberg's making ready player one
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:09.920]   What isn't that a great novel? Everybody must have read that here
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:17.600]   Uh, I think we'll wait and narrated it for audible.com. So it is uh, it is going to make a big splash at kamakan
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.920]   and uh
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:26.000]   Ernest clines really popular not popular. I don't know if it was a bestseller in the real world, but among us geeks
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.360]   It was a very
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:35.520]   widely loved uh mark riles was it i think probably you know, I know everybody I know read it
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.320]   um
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:41.920]   TJ millers in it. I love mark riles
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:46.400]   Did he he was nominated for an Oscar? I think he wanted uh or an Oscar this year
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:49.280]   Yeah, he said he's been doing a bunch of stuff with spielberg recently
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:54.400]   I really like bridge of spies, which is like a nice slow pace by thriller starring him. Yeah, yeah
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.800]   Well, stard tom hanks. Yeah, but he riles had the best role in it, which is a
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.600]   Best performance in that film amazing performance. Yeah
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:04.960]   uh 22 thousand people
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:10.080]   neglected to read the terms uh for the wifi
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:13.680]   uh, and uh
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:20.800]   So they basically agreed to clean public toilets purple is a company based in manchester that does wi-fi hot spots for lego land
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:22.880]   Outback at pitz express
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:30.880]   They inserted a community service clause into their two week into their uh, wi-fi agreement terms of service for two weeks
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:35.120]   That that uh acquired users to do any of the following
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:39.840]   Cleansing local parks of animal waste providing hugs to stray cats and dogs
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:45.920]   Manually relieving sewer blockages cleaning portable lavatories at local festivals and events
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:51.600]   Painting snail shells to brighten up their existence or scraping chewing gum off the streets
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.720]   There was a prize for anyone who contacted the company and pointed out the clause only one person
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:00.400]   Contacted the company everybody else agreed
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.360]   Uh, why not?
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.920]   So next time you don't read the agreement
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:10.640]   You might be you know, we we really need we really do need to do something about that
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:12.000]   I think you know
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.960]   Before I was a tech person I was really a writer and editor and I care a lot about language and I care a lot about the way that we communicate with one another
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.040]   and
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:24.880]   There's just something fundamentally wrong with the way that we handle
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:26.720]   um
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:31.200]   These terms of service that it's not clear. Nobody reads it
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.480]   Um, they're always so long that you can't actually get to anything important anyway
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.520]   and I frankly feel the same way about a lot of the
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:47.440]   Um, way that laws are written and legal decisions are written is they're not they're not written in plain language for people to make sense of them
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:50.720]   And I think it's done on purpose and there's got to be some other better way
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:52.880]   to
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:56.720]   Legislative that it should be clear. I don't know if legislative is exactly the right way to do it
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.160]   But there's got to be some
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:02.640]   Company to step up and make these terms clear short concise
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:10.640]   Understandable, uh so that we that we make the point that people can consent when they know what they're consenting to yeah
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:12.640]   I agree 100 percent 100 percent
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:19.040]   Maybe more like the way android handles, you know permission alerts like this app is going to do this and this and this
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.080]   Uh, there has been some talk about trying to make you lives a little more human readable
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:26.640]   But yeah, I don't know what it's going to take for that to happen
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:29.440]   We're going to need those robot lawyers. Yeah
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:35.040]   Well, here's the good news ai's coming and elon musk has just told a group of america's governors
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:38.480]   We better make up some rules on ai before it's too late
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.920]   elon thinks it could be too late
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:48.080]   He says ai is the biggest risk we face as a civilization he spoke at the national governor's association
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.640]   summer meeting in rote island he said
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:54.960]   Government has to proactively regulate artificial intelligence
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:59.920]   Before things advanced too far until people see robots going down the street killing people
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:02.960]   They don't know how to react because he seems so ethereal
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:10.560]   Ai is a rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because I think by the time we're reactive in ai
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.640]   It's too late
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:16.800]   The biggest risk for civilization are you kidding me?
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:20.800]   There are some other problems. I think out there
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:27.040]   Already have yeah, there's giant iceberg the size of Delaware that's headed our way
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:34.080]   There's other issues, but but in robots that we program to come and shoot it like gotta watch out
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:35.840]   I'm not gonna write those
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:37.360]   It is saying this for years
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:42.640]   I know like this isn't a new thing for him and actually steven hawking of all people is like on this bandwagon too
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:45.600]   the thing is like we're making fun of it now and
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:49.680]   Yeah, because there's so much else going on the world. It's terrifying
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:54.880]   Uh, but yeah, I'm also kind of of the mind that there is a point where we need to just like
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:59.760]   Really step back and look what we're doing philosophically and like logically as well
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:03.600]   Like we are going to start creating these things and we're not going to know what to do with them
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:10.880]   But yeah, if you start warning people about robots killing them in the streets and that that sounds like too hyperbolic for right now anyway
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:12.080]   Yeah
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:17.840]   Yeah, well and ethically too, but yeah your point taken, you know who got to scare people into it first
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:23.600]   Yeah, that's kind of there was wasn't that uh, there was that climate change article from was it the Atlantic?
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:28.160]   The one that was no New York magazine. We're New York magazine. Oh, that was depressing
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:31.840]   Oh, but a lot of climate scientists came back and were like, yeah
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:37.520]   Some of this is true, but also this seems really overblown scaring people probably isn't the best tactic
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:41.520]   But yeah, I I'm also of the mind that we need to think hard about this technology
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.480]   Like what AI will mean for us as humanity like once we have these robots doing all this work for us
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:52.640]   Maybe not even like I'm not personally afraid of robots killing us, but I am it's pretty clear
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:55.440]   They're gonna take a lot of jobs and what's gonna happen then?
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:00.160]   Yeah, well I can barely get scary to read my music my and my my shows to me
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:03.920]   So I I don't think we have to worry now, but I do think that if people aren't
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:06.960]   Like people on doing it. We become so easily complacent
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:11.200]   We're we're kind of lazy by nature. So if we're not really frightened to something
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:15.120]   We're not gonna do anything to it and for robotics and nai
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.920]   We do want to make sure that there's rules in place before we do it
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:21.520]   We don't want this to be like testing nukes. We're like, oh, it might burn through the atmosphere
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:25.120]   But let's do it anyways and see right we want it to be beforehand
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.880]   So I I can understand why they've kind of used the fear-based tactics
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:34.640]   It works for like politics and poker players. So might work for this too. All right. I'm a cheer everybody up
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:38.080]   It's national ice cream day today go out and get an ice cream cone
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.720]   There's lots of places giving away free ice cream deals including Mickey D's carvel
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:45.200]   dip in dots
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:47.680]   Steak and shake pet smart
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:53.280]   Well, those are only doggy ice cream sundaes and of course world famous baskin robins
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:02:01.360]   Uh ice cream day tomorrow is emoji day world emoji day man
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:06.160]   Like you don't like emojis. What's wrong with you?
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:11.600]   I need like an emoji of existential dread to describe 2017. I don't know what that looks like
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:17.120]   Yeah, yeah, I have a world emoji day t-shirt. I'll break it up. I'll break it out for tomorrow
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.000]   Celebrate actually our
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.240]   our own
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:22.960]   um
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.800]   tanya
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:29.040]   Is responsible for one of the new emojis that is appearing this year
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:32.640]   She really lobbied heart. We had a guy. Yeah a guy from the Unicode
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.360]   committee
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:40.160]   Who was talking on the show about all the new emojis. She said there really ought to be a milkshake
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:42.240]   Why isn't there a milkshake emoji?
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:47.440]   And he and tanya hall convinced him to submit it. They accepted it
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:49.680]   It's officially called drink with straw
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:51.840]   Or cup with straw
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:57.200]   But it sure looks like a milkshake to me except a twitter where it looks like a cool refreshing glass of water
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:02.720]   And emoji one apparently looks like a solo cup. So I don't know what they're drinking in there, but uh
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:09.040]   Happy emote world emoji day happy ice cream day and thank you all for being here. Thank you, especially
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:14.160]   To the returned jill duffy, please come back soon jill e duffy on twitter
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:20.240]   And don't forget our website. I see it's in here. Do you want it? Do you want to plug the productivity report?
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:24.960]   Oh, yeah. So for the last two years i've been doing this thing called productivity report.org
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:29.840]   um where i'm reading research about personal productivity and
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:35.440]   Looking to see what's true and what's not true so things like multitasking, you know, we've all been told don't do it
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:39.040]   Don't do it and it turns out there's a lot of good research that supports it
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:45.200]   Under the right circumstances. So topics like, you know email and time management
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:51.680]   Um distractions what kinds of things should you have on your desk to help you focus all that kind of stuff
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:57.200]   This is good and I agree with you your most recent article that says nobody likes open offices
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:59.280]   So why do we still use them?
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:01.360]   Life open offices they're cheap. That's why we use them
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:04.960]   We had an open office remember in the old building the brick house
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:10.320]   And everybody in the who had to work in the open office complain because we were always saying shwir. We're bird
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:16.560]   So we we they now have regular normal offices and uh, oh, that's so nice and we're in a little room
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:19.280]   all alone
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:22.800]   You're happy there. Yeah
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:28.240]   This is good. I'm gonna read more of this productivity report.org. Thank you, Jill duffy
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:32.640]   And i'll see you soon. We got to get you on before you go to boogerest
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:36.560]   Although boogerest is not as different a time zone as uh, should I
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:42.880]   No, not nearly not nearly as bad. I did it. I don't know if you remember but all of your indian fans remember
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:48.400]   I did it one time from india and it was from i think it was from 3 30 in the morning till 5 30 in the morning
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.320]   I do remember and I felt and that's on the sun was coming up behind me
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:57.280]   I just treated it like I was going to the airport for an early morning flight is, you know, it's kind of fun for me
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:03.520]   And we never had a one. Yeah, yeah, that was it. We learned I didn't read at the time when I got we got you on
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:06.720]   I found out you were in india. I was blown away. I had no idea
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.200]   I thought well, this is very nice of her to do this. So thank you
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:14.240]   And uh, and now that you're in the bay area. It won't be so hard and I hope we'll get you on one more
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:19.120]   And of course, we love seeing georgia doubt good luck at finding a home with two 14 by 11 rooms
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:23.440]   Thank you completely empty devoid of furniture or any obstructions
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:27.360]   Yeah, are you really going to get that is that really what you're looking for?
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:32.400]   No, really that's really what we're going to get like we need to have like downstairs place for the kids to play
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:36.080]   But we can also then hook up the machines as well. So it's also like playrooms
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:40.160]   It's so she's buying a house with two VR rooms
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:44.640]   You'll find more of georgia doubt and I'm more.com and of course anxiety videos
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:50.320]   Thank you everybody for joining us. We had a great studio audience from all over the world is really nice to have all of you in here
[02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:55.840]   Uh appreciate your visit and a whole family and they survived mostly mom's gone. No mom's still here
