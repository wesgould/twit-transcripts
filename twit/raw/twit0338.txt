[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.440]   We thought we'd bring you in before the Super Bowl

[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.280]   Yeah, no agenda show.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.320]   Anything else?
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.120]   Yeah, devorek.org/blog.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.600]   Really?
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.080]   Yeah, you get a drink there.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.920]   You can drink.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920]   The real devorek.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920]   Whatever.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.240]   You'll find me here and there.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.840]   Look me up on Google.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.520]   Why not?
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.280]   What the hell?
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.560]   Also with us, Jolie Odell from Venture Beat.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.880]   Yeah, this time.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.320]   Last time, something else.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.360]   No, no.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.880]   No, she was--
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.560]   It was Venture Beat.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.080]   It's been Venture Beat all this year.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.520]   All year.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.200]   All year.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.800]   Hello, Jolie.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.680]   Great to have you.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.960]   Jolie's new book is Android Photography,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.720]   a guide to mobile creativity.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.600]   You know, I think this is great because everybody
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   talks about iPhone or iPhoneography.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   iPhoneography.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.840]   And I think the new Android phones,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.240]   I was just using the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.040]   What do you use?
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.400]   Well, I don't anymore.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.720]   When I finish that book, I basically--
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.120]   You're the one who told us she doesn't have a phone.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.400]   And you wrote a book about cell phone photography.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.200]   Yes, a little while after?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.880]   It's just like irony there.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.360]   It is.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.400]   After I finished that book, I got rid of my phones.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.040]   I just was all phoned out.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.600]   I see.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.480]   It was the book that did it.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.080]   Perhaps.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.200]   You know now that I think about it.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.040]   Perchance.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.760]   But yeah.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.560]   It's a fun book.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.760]   JolieOdel.com.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.440]   Also, here from across the pond,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.760]   Will Harris, channelflip.com.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   Did you do the little foot stamp when you did the side swipe?
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.360]   Absolutely.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.000]   How are you, Lyah?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.080]   Gonna suck in a while.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.720]   It's been a while, huh?
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.680]   So well, you were on TNT, and we couldn't talk about it.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.320]   So I thought I got to get him on now so we can talk about it.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.600]   Will his flips, channelflip?
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.480]   Yeah?
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.360]   Who'd you sell it to?
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.080]   We sold to a very cool company called Shine Group.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   Shine Group.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   It's a big production company which is owned by Newscorp.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   Will you sell it to Bernard?
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.600]   Yes.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.560]   Ah, come on, you mate.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.960]   I hope you took him for a pass of the money.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.560]   That's awesome.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.760]   Well, there are very exciting organizations to be part of.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.440]   You have to say that for now.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.440]   How long do you have to say that for?
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.480]   Yeah, I work for them too, you know.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.400]   Now they own my soul.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.040]   Are you still there?
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.360]   I mean, you have to stick around for a while as a founder, right?
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.920]   Oh, well, I think the cool thing about Shine
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.120]   is that they're really like high quality production company,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.880]   and they're actually going to help us make everything
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.120]   that we do a lot better.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.240]   Channelflip is--
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.720]   Like, actually, it's getting started.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.520]   Channelflip is a true IP TV play.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.240]   Unlike Twit, which is really kind of a geek podcast network,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.400]   you're doing like sitcoms and stuff like that.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.720]   Well, not so much sitcoms, but a lot of comedy stuff.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.000]   We started doing some documentary stuff.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.720]   Real TV.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.640]   Yeah, I would say so, except in sort of three and five minute
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.480]   segments.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.760]   And so for us, the great thing about Shine
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.080]   is they make MasterChef and The Office and "Ogry Betty"
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.480]   and like--
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.920]   Oh my god, oh, I didn't know that.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.240]   This is like a real production company.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.400]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.480]   And they've got, you know, offices in like 25 countries
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.040]   or something.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.560]   They make the UK office or the American office.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.720]   They make the American office.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.840]   They own Reveley.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.080]   Oh, Reveley, yeah.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.760]   Yeah, so they own that.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.960]   So now we're like a sister company to Reveley.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.240]   So that gives us quite a lot of opportunity
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.760]   to do some cool stuff.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.800]   How much money did you get?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.440]   He's not Kevin Rose money.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.240]   He's enjoying, not to say.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.880]   But I have to--
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.000]   But a full disclosure--
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.600]   I thought I'd ask.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.280]   Four years ago, when you started Channelflip,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.040]   you gave me some shares of it.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.680]   And for which I thank you and actually--
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.480]   With a lot lawyers, we'll be calling.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.400]   No, they already did.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.240]   They couldn't sell it without my say-so.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.920]   And I said, yeah.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.480]   And they sent me a check in December.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.080]   So I received a little--
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.480]   we can't disclose.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.520]   Apparently, I didn't know this.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.160]   In fact, I am glad I asked Will.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.280]   He says, I'm not allowed to say.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.880]   I'm enjoying from saying how much it is.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.360]   But--
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.080]   Well, how much is it?
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.400]   I don't know.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.560]   I can't say.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.080]   But-- well, we just-- what did we come up with?
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.600]   Enough for a round of beers for the Twit Crew.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.640]   More than that.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.320]   But enough to party with MC Hammer,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.360]   but not enough to party with Jay-Z, you said, Jolie.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.880]   And I think that's probably about right.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.280]   That's somewhere in there.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.040]   I don't know what that means.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.200]   I don't know what that means.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.080]   But anyway, thank you.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.760]   You-- Carpool is now a Channelflip production.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.360]   Yes.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.000]   And we've actually got a new show with Rob--
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.400]   with Rob Llewell and he is well known to be known--
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.560]   Cryton and Red Dwarf's "Crap It Challenge."
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.440]   A new show, which I think starts next month,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.080]   which is all about electric cars and electric vehicles
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.440]   and clean energy.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.720]   He's really into that stuff.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.520]   Carpool's "Wash It"--
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.240]   He really loves that stuff.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.720]   What will the-- do you know what the new show will be named?
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.960]   Yeah, it's called "Fully Charged."
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.720]   Of course.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.400]   How exciting.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.920]   That's great.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.400]   Yeah, Bobby's a wonderful guy.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.920]   Please give him my regards.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.440]   I will be.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.960]   I will be.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.440]   He was out here.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.760]   He's shooting Red Dwarf at the moment.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.320]   I know.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.160]   He's got the rubber face back on.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.400]   Anyway, well, congratulations.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.360]   I think that's great.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.480]   It is just the beginning.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.640]   I think that you're going to see mainstream media companies
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.200]   like Shine start to--
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.320]   I hope start to snip up new media companies.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.400]   You're rolling in dough.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.080]   You don't care.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.200]   I actually don't want to sell because I like what I'm doing.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.720]   But I do think that you're going to see a lot of this
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.200]   because they're saying, what is going on?
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.320]   Yeah, we've got to have a bubble.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.920]   Come on, people.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.040]   What the hell?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.000]   Let's bubble it up.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.560]   Yeah, I think--
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.320]   Get the heck out of here.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.040]   I think that--
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.200]   Gee-four is going to come knocking people out.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.680]   Oh, god.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.440]   Wouldn't that be awful?
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.880]   I did an April Fool's joke about three years ago on April Fool's.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.440]   I said I was so happy to be joining the G-4 family
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.720]   and they bought Twit and it's just great news for everybody.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.400]   And people believed me.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.880]   That was awful.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.600]   It's very remotely believable.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.960]   It is.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.120]   That's why I did it for April Fool's.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.480]   It's distant.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.200]   If I would have spotted the date,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.600]   I would have known it was bull crap.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.160]   You always do your April Fool's columns
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.920]   and there's always a slurp--
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.320]   Slurp-a-loof.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.440]   I, unfortunately, I'm going to have to stop using that.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.320]   Everybody knows now.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.360]   It's April Fool's bagger.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.880]   But it's usually a deep in the column.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.400]   It's usually the PR girl.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.480]   Her name is slurp-a-loof.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.040]   And she says something stupid.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.360]   It--
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.400]   What is the key to a good April Fool's column?
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   Believability.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   Yep.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   Oh, you've done this too?
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   We have so much fun in the newsrooms
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   planning for our big April Fool's pranks.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   April Fool's so much.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   It's so good.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   I hate it because--
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   You get to troll people.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   I am.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   I'm a victim.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   I'm a victim.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   And the more people you troll,
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   the more you laugh, the better it is.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   Not that I'm a troll.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   What's your best April Fool's story, remember?
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   Oh, you know, I can't remember.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   John?
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   It's probably still ahead of me.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   You know, I had--
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   I'm actually in the hoax hall of fame
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   with the one I did about the getting drunk on the information super highway.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   You get in the hoax hall of fame if the story that you write gets into Wikipedia.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   The two that I liked the best one I did, one where they were going to change the name
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   of Sioux City or Sioux Falls to Gateway City.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.400]   And I had a bunch of documentation showing how this was going on around the country.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   People were taking money from large corporations to change their name.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   And this is based on changing a Pac Bell park to, you know, the monster stadium,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   whatever they call them.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   And that ran above the fold in the local paper in Sioux Falls.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   Whoa.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   Right at the top.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.400]   That's it.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   When you get-- if you get somebody to pick it up legitimately--
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   They were all moaning and groaning about this column.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   But the better one was the infra-- which was a bill they were going to pass that required
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   people to be sober when they were using a modem.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   And then I made the assertion that these idiots in Congress didn't know what a modem was
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   and they just knew about information super highway.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   And so they thought it was drunk driving and they were crazy.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   Wow.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   So I--
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   That's a great idea.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   And then-- and I named Leahy and two other senators.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   And they got tons of calls.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   Of course.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   Leahy was irked.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   So this is my favorite new site.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   I found out about this.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   We were interviewing Clay Johnson about his book on information diet.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   And it was all about like how to vet information, make sure that you eat good information,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   you know, also information.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   And he pointed to this site.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   It's called gullible.info.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   And this guy just has fun making up facts that sound true.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   Oh, man.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:53.400]   And he spends now a lot of time going to Wikipedia to delete this data that gets in because people
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   believe it.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   For instance--
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   Why bother?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   We should do a contest.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   This would be a great game show.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   I give you three facts.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   One of them is true.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   For instance, the title lyric of the Old English Carol, "God rest ye, merry gentlemen" was
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   originally a sexual innuendo.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   Tour false.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   Yes.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   False.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   That was hoping.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:18.400]   The sale of 1% milk has declined nearly 26% since the beginning of the Occupy Wall Street
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   protests.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   I find my friends a similar site.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   What's one got to do with the other?
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   One percent.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   Get it?
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   Most of the world's French fries are neither French nor fried.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   That's ridiculous.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   That sounds true.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   That sounds true.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   It sounds true.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   It sounds true.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   It sounds true.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   Geneticists discovered in 2004 the human ability to see the color red stems from a genetic mutation
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   that took place in a common ancestor two million years ago.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.480]   Projections indicate that in another million years red color receptors will be a recessive
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.280]   gene and appear only in a minority of humans.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   I believe that.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.600]   I believe it too.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.800]   They actually--one of the facts that this guy made up--these are all made up.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.560]   None of these are true.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.400]   One of the facts this guy has made up consistently gets back into Wikipedia, which was that
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   Timothy Leary claimed to have found a new color called Glendale.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.440]   It has appeared ever since in his biography that people keep putting it back in.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.640]   Did you know that Jude Law stipulates in his film contracts that none of his movies may
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.760]   be preceded in theaters by any previews in which he also appears?
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   Not true.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   Anyway, enough.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   That's the fake news.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   Now we've got some real news.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.760]   How about that?
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.760]   Big story.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.360]   The big story of the week we talked about a little bit on this week in Google.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:41.400]   Google announced that they have a new privacy policy and they're going to unify data across
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.240]   all of their platforms.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.120]   What they know about you from watching YouTube will be added to Google Search, will be added
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.440]   to Gmail, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.040]   They announced a new privacy policy.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.000]   In fact, if you haven't gone to google.com lately, you might want to go because they'll
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.080]   say right at the beginning of it, we have a new privacy policy and it's not the same
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.240]   old yada yada.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.920]   Actually, I guess I've been there so I'm not seeing it now.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.360]   But see if you see it.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.280]   It's not the same old yada yada.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   Is that what it says?
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   Yada yada.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.280]   I'm going to go to YouTube to get it.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.280]   You get it if you log into Gmail.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   I got to do it to me.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   If you go to Google plus and you go into YouTube, it's like, oh my god, there's a new
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.280]   privacy policy.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   I know it's fine.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.360]   If you want to read a really bad one, go look at the new one from CNBC.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   I can only imagine.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:32.000]   So Washington Post, before the policy came out, really cried wolf on this.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.280]   The Fox News said in capital letters, be afraid.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.400]   People have been just going crazy.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.160]   Even extreme tech wrote an article about how Google's new policy has no opt out and
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.000]   all of a sudden the Google is evil.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Agree?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.600]   You know, we knew this was coming for a long time.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.320]   Ever since Google plus launched, I went to Google and said, okay, we're going to go
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.040]   what's your big strategy with this?
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.360]   Surely it's more than a dinky little social network.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.360]   And they said, yeah.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   Next door quit.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360]   Well, no, it was there.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:08.080]   Their plan was to unify all Google Web products under one umbrella so that you have one identity
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   that you use everywhere.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.320]   You have one login.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.800]   You have one privacy policy.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.000]   And I think that what they're doing with this privacy policy, they've whitewashed it,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   which is their job.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.760]   You know, they want to make sure that the web is personalized for you and that you can
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   share with everybody.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.200]   But what if you don't want personalized content?
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.440]   What if you don't want the sharing?
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:31.080]   What if I don't want my personal life and my social life to be dragged onto the internet
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.080]   wherever I go?
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080]   Is the problem.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.680]   So you have to log out of Google and stop using Google Web products, which isn't convenient,
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.080]   but you know, it's not like we don't have other options.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.240]   I should talk about a couple of things here.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.440]   One is the some of the new technologies being used to track you, namely IP tracking.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   That's instead of putting cookies on your machine, there's databases of IP addresses
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.760]   and they can just, they all subscribe to it.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.760]   You don't need a cookie.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.160]   Yeah, cookies are bogus.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.840]   All I need to know is a few, maybe a half dozen parameters about your browser, what
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.480]   versions of things you're running and I can tell exactly who you are.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.680]   Now, the thing that's out there is people should look at is a product called Ghostery.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   Yes.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   Ghostery.com.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   It's a Firefox plugin.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.080]   Actually, it works on all the browsers.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.280]   And what it does is it sees who's doing what to you.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.360]   And then it gives you kind of a quasi report and you'll find a lot of these sites that
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.280]   seem innocuous or they have a Gillian trackers on you and Google is like one of the least
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.000]   of the one of the least problematic.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Yes, that's problematic.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.280]   They don't need to track you because they're not really a crowd.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   Everywhere on the Internet.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.240]   Google Analytics is one of the things that will show up when you use Ghostery.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   That shows up constantly.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.240]   And we use Google Analytics.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.080]   Actually, I'm proud to say that on twitter.tv I think there's three Ghostery items.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   But it's hard.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.360]   Look, every website you go to is almost certainly logging your IP address.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:53.160]   If it has ad banners, the company that serves those ad banners, Google, DoubleClicker, whoever
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.680]   is also able to track you from site to site.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   This is going on.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.800]   Well, that's part of the disgusting commercialization of the Internet.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.040]   And that's one thing.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.160]   But the other thing is your personal life and your social life, your intellectual life,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.040]   which are very different from what you do online.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.360]   Sometimes you just need to be anonymous.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.280]   And when I talk to Brad Bradley Horowitz at Google, one of the last times I was there,
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.480]   I was like, Bradley.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.120]   It seems like you are making us log in to do everything so you can track us everywhere.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120]   What if you don't want that?
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.520]   And he gave me the indication that you were going to be able to anonymously and studentonymously
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.760]   use Google products.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.120]   And I am starting to feel like I was lied to.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   I think it's really interesting.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.280]   I'm so pissed off about that.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.920]   It's sort of making Google into not a series of disparate products, but a one sort of holistic
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.160]   googly experience.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:50.520]   And so there was a really interesting quote from, I think it was last week that Sergey
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.680]   that Larry Page was saying, you know, if you're too internal internally to Google employees,
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.920]   if you're not on board with Search West Your World and this new--
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   Get out of here.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.920]   He said, yeah.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   Get out of here.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.680]   What was also interesting was that he referred to a number of times and in previous speech
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.520]   over the last few weeks has talked a lot about how he wants Google to be a beautiful
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.080]   experience.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.680]   And that's not something that we've ever really associated with Google before.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:18.080]   And I think it's quite clear that he's started thinking, in my mind, it's like the productization
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.920]   of the Google experience, if that's a real word.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.720]   It's like making all these disparate Google bits into one place that you sort of come
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.560]   together or one experience.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.960]   There's all like Google searches to hub in the same way that Facebook wall is your hub.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.320]   But all the rest of it is all unified and linked in.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.240]   On the one hand, of course, Google's a private company, not private, publicly held, but
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.000]   they're in a co-corporation.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.520]   They're entitled and in fact, I think probably obliged fiduciary to make as much money as
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.280]   they can fiduciary at least.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280]   I don't know.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   I don't know.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.880]   It is their fiduciary responsibility to return a profit to the stakeholders.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.440]   On the other hand, we do expect, I think, a little more of Google, for a couple of reasons.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.560]   One, don't be evil as supposedly their motto.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.480]   I think we could throw that one out.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.480]   Oh, come now.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.480]   That's ridiculous.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.480]   They said it, but obviously it's no longer true.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.200]   It's because corporations are neither evil.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.200]   Nor not evil.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   They're just corporations.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.040]   They are profit driven.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.800]   However, you piss off your users, your advertisers go where the users go, and they are linked.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:27.280]   And I think we, because they run the search engine that is what fuels travel on the internet
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.440]   without a good search engine, without Google, the internet doesn't work, we expect more
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.440]   of them.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.080]   They're almost a public service.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.200]   They're almost a public service.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.520]   And if you think, oh, I can go use Bing, Bing's doing this already as well.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.720]   They're combining Facebook with Bing results.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:46.120]   I don't think Bing's any less of a unified experience.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.880]   Google, I do praise them for at least publishing a unified privacy policy.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.680]   I mean, that's a big step forward.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   It's in plain English.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.640]   You can at least see what Google's doing.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.360]   They do something that nobody does, which I think is fantastic, which is the Google dashboard.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.600]   You can go to google.com/dashboard and see what they know about it.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.000]   Is your machine flipping around, pouncing around on this?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   What's happened to it?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.240]   Was that a flat table?
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.240]   You sure it's the table?
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   It could be machine.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   It could be your MacBook Air is warped.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.240]   I don't think so.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.240]   I think it's the table.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.240]   Oh, no.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.240]   See, look.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.600]   You know the guy, I never mind.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   So I can see my dashboard.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.440]   I can see exactly what they know about me.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.320]   And that's good.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.000]   And as they point out, you couldn't log out of your Google account and continue to use
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.320]   Google, some Google tools, not all, but you could watch videos on YouTube.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.800]   You could search on Google without anything being saved about you.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.720]   So I think that given that they are a company designed to make money, you can also use
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.440]   Scrugal for your search engine.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.280]   You could use Scrugal if you're on Safari.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.280]   You can use private browsing.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.120]   You could use an encyclopedia and read the newspaper.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.120]   Huh?
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.360]   Private browsing works on Firefox too.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.600]   So I think they're on Firefox on Safari.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   And I would point out.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   And you could private browser anything.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   There is.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.920]   If you're not, if you didn't want to be in this, in this thing, you can, A, you can try
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   and opt out of it with Google.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.000]   And you can just opt out of it at the client and just use a browser and support cookies.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.320]   Or, but here's the problem.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.760]   You can opt out all you want from these services.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.880]   Your internet service provider, you can't opt out from.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.680]   And they can collect everything you're doing.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   And in fact, our--
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   By law, I think they have to--
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.160]   We're acquired by the law to save two years of it for the FBI at the FBI request.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.120]   So in-- I mean, maybe we trust the government more than we trust Google.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.840]   I know you don't.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.920]   But of course not.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.080]   But at least you know what Google's motivations are.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   You never know what the--
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.080]   I do.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.080]   --what's motivations are.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   I'll profit.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.080]   What is the government motive?
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   We don't know.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.080]   Profit.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   Who knows what it is.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   That's intelligent.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:50.480]   Who knows how they interpret that.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:59.200]   So I think the thing that remind people is privacy policy or not, dashboard or not, your
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.080]   data is being collected about you every time you step out onto the internet.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.080]   You're in public.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.560]   So you might as well act as if you're in public.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   It's just kind of pressing.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.120]   And if you don't like it, read the newspaper, you're right.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.120]   Well, yes.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.160]   I mean, it's enough to make me want to put on my tin foil hat and go into a cabin.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.960]   Or do as I do and just go bleh.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   What?
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   Bleh.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   Here it all is.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   Sorry.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   What is the deal?
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   Oh, you mean you're a trans--
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   I'm letting it all hang out.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   Hang out.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   I hide nothing.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   Oh, really?
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.960]   Then how much did you get that check for?
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   I can't.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   You know what?
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   So it's no--
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   I would tell you.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   I don't care.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.040]   But unfortunately, I didn't know this.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.000]   And it's good you told me I'm contractually required not to say that.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   You remember--
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And it's why--
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   You didn't read the--
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I didn't read that first.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   But this is why I don't sign NDAs.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.800]   I don't sign embargoes because I don't know what I can say or not.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.160]   And so normally--
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.760]   I don't sign-- I make a big fuss about not signing this stuff.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:51.440]   It turns out that-- I mean, I'll agree to embargoes orally because I'm fine with it.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.680]   But I won't sign these documents.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   And if I was there--
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   Me neither.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   I think it's journalistically--
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   I think it's corrupt.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   I think it's corrupt.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.200]   It's slightly corrupt.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.320]   However, I did-- I'm pretty sure-- will I turn you down when you offer me these shares
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.000]   and you send them to me anyway?
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   It's your fault.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I'm not fucking true.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Probably true.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   He--
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.880]   I'm very grateful, to be honest with you.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   I'm very grateful because it is-- it was a surprise and it came at the right time.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.800]   It sounds like it was a chunk of money.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.760]   It was enough to buy some presents.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.760]   Presence?
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.760]   For all my loved ones.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.760]   I didn't get anything.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   And there's quite a few of those.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.760]   You are--
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.760]   I like how you draw the thing.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.760]   You are the same.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.120]   So-- but in general-- and by the way, I am donating more than half of it to a charity.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   Oh, brother.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.120]   It's charity.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.320]   Most of it to my-- to our school.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:45.680]   But in others-- and then we donate-- actually, Twit has some local-- we try to donate locally
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.320]   because I want to support local groups.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.520]   But that's-- I don't mean to-- sorry, I even brought that up.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   Back to the news.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.880]   You do have a choice, Jolie.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.880]   You could either withdraw.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.520]   The problem is, you can't use a credit card.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   You can't-- you know, you got a lot--
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   Oh, well, I mean--
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.640]   And going completely off the grid is an option.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.120]   And in Britain, you can't walk down the street because there's a camera every five feet.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.120]   Well, that's definitely--
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.560]   I mean, suppose on the internet, there are parts of your personal life that you would
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.000]   like to keep off of it.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.480]   Google is making it increasingly difficult to establish those borders.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.480]   Then you don't share those.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.880]   Then don't share those online.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   Don't use Facebook.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   If-- I mean--
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.000]   Don't email your girlfriend or boyfriend from Gmail.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   You can use encrypted email.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Use encryption.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Try telling them what you average to do.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Or you do everything--
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   You can do encryption, though.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   In every day life.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Like, really?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I know.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I mean, it's disappointing.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   I know what he's coming from.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.160]   Like, it's all very well saying, okay, you know, if you're not comfortable with all these
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.520]   privacy controls, don't, you know, put all this private stuff online.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.000]   But, you know, the government expects you to do your taxes online these days.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Like, you're encouraging that.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Like, you're encouraging that.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.760]   Like, you know, all the sort of, you know, health and social services and all this kind
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.520]   of stuff is all this thing online.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.880]   We're moving to a world where you have to be online and everything has to be online.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.960]   So actually, you know, Joey's point.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.520]   How much choice do you really have if you have to be online or the major places that
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.760]   you're going to be online are going to keep all this data back here?
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.160]   I guess it's true if you decide to withdraw-- good luck getting a job.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.640]   I thought you really don't have much of a choice.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.640]   A choice.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.640]   A choice.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.640]   A job?
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.640]   You could buy groceries.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   Not a great job.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.080]   Well, you have a great job and you could do fine without being on the phone.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.960]   What do you mean, my whole job is online?
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   Well, I'm just--
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   What are you talking about?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   But you could have the same job.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   You could do it.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   You have a beautiful voice, Leo.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.320]   So I could not be online.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   I could tell stories.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.320]   You have to put it in.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   You could do NPR.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   You've got a great NPR.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   We're going to have reading group tonight and I will read two.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.120]   I think this is what you should do.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.120]   What?
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120]   What you just described.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.120]   I'll read you.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.160]   You should give up on this crap.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.280]   You could be the next Lavart Burton.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   I should.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   Reading Rainbow.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.920]   I could wear special little sunglasses.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.760]   No, I think that I don't mind being online and I don't mind that people know about me.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.840]   And I'm usually pretty forthright about what is going on in my life.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.600]   And so the only restriction, unfortunately, I have to place is when other people get involved.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:10.280]   Like, for instance, Will here, who is not allowed to say what this company is so forth.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.800]   So I can't.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   Or my family members.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.920]   It's not for me to decide what's public about my family life.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.760]   But for me, I got nothing to hide.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.920]   And it's interesting.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.360]   I mean, I think one of the things that we keep coming up against is the age thing where if
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.920]   you have the same conversation with a bunch of teenagers, I'm pretty sure you'll just
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.960]   get absolutely non-plus looks of me.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.400]   Do you think they care?
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.400]   That's true.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   I agree.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   They don't give a monkey.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   They don't care.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.400]   I don't think they see the consequences.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.840]   Teenagers and consequences are like peanut butter and ladies.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.840]   They just don't mix.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.840]   Really?
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   Ladies don't like peanut butter and ladies.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   Well, I mean, I stole that line from a film.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   That's good.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.840]   It's a good line.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   Thank you.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.840]   I would say that's utterly not okay.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.840]   So if there were two things that would mix really well, I would say peanut butter and
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   ladies.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.600]   Your kink is not my kink, man.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.080]   It depends on the lady.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.400]   And I think we have a show title.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.200]   We'll be right back with more with Jolie O'Dell.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   It's great to have you.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   John C. Devorak.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.000]   Will Harris.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.040]   And I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.240]   You know everything about me.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.600]   This show brought to you by our good friends at GoToMyPC.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600]   Citrix makes it.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.720]   It's a great tool for remote access.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.120]   And you know, it gets better and better because it gets more and more portable.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.040]   I want you to go to the site, go to myPC.com and take a look at it because now go to my
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.360]   PC works on the iPhone.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.120]   It's worked for years on Mac and PC.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.880]   You put it on your office computer or your home computer, whatever computer you want to
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.880]   access.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.840]   And then wherever you go, you can get to that computer via computer, of course, iPhone,
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.920]   iPad, Android phone.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.240]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.280]   The scenario you might think about is you're on your way home.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.280]   Here's one.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.320]   You're on your way to the airport.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.800]   And you just realize, oh crap, I forgot my PowerPoint presentation.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.560]   You could do what we used to do, turn around, miss your flight.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.160]   Or you can keep on going, whip out your iPhone when you get to the airport and download it
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.600]   using GoToMyPC.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.760]   It's like having your work computer in your pocket.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.320]   So whenever you need to get on to the computer, you can just log in on your Mac, your iPad,
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.920]   your Windows machine, your iPhone, your Android phone, your Android tablet.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.240]   There's your computer.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.840]   You can run any, you see the desktop, you can run any program, send and receive email.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.520]   All your network resources are available.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.120]   You can even transfer from one machine to the other.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:37.280]   Edit PowerPoints, even or keynote presentations, updates, spreadsheets, work on any file, all
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.600]   from your iPhone or your iPad.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.280]   Very easy to set up, so much so that I'm going to give you a chance to do that right now.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.680]   You don't need help from IT department.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.920]   You don't need to port forward.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   You don't need to do anything.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   Just visit the website.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.440]   Go to myPC.com, click the orange, try it free button, use the promo code TWIT.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.560]   And you've got 30 days free of unlimited use.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.720]   They used to know when we first started advertising, they'd give you an hour.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.600]   I said, wait, no, I want a month from my people.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.000]   I want a month of unlimited use.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.560]   They said, of course.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.360]   So now you can try it for 30 days.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.680]   Just do it all the time and you'll see it's so incredible.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.440]   The app for the iPhone, the iPad, all these apps, they're free and the trial is free too.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.720]   Go to myPC.com, use the offer code TWIT and give it a try today.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.360]   Now iPhone, Android, iPad, it's just fantastic.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.880]   New CEO at RIM.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.840]   You know what?
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.080]   They needed to get rid of those clowns.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   Right?
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   Apparently.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.640]   They had a dual CEO think.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.840]   John's mic's not on it.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.840]   There it is.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.840]   Hello?
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.320]   You know the old saying better than an idiot.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   You don't know.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:50.080]   So now this new CEO, they got rid of Michael Azard.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   What is his name?
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.080]   There was a dual.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   There were two.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.080]   They were co-CEOs.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.080]   Yeah, co-CEOs, which is always a bad idea.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.680]   This is causing interference on my head.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.880]   This thing?
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.280]   You unplug my headphones, won't it?
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.560]   Oh, but I think what could I have possibly have done?
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.560]   You put a giant bird.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.560]   It's a tiny little bird.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.000]   You're a giant bird on my head.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.320]   This is like an angry bird.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   It's an angry bird.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.080]   Somebody made a picture of me.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.440]   I look just like that, by the way.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.080]   I have to find it.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.640]   With chatroom, if you got the link to that angry bird picture of me, let me know and
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.640]   I'll post it.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.240]   Because I got the eyebrows.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.440]   Oh my God, you're right.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.440]   Kinda.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.440]   Holy shit.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.880]   You don't want to see me angry.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   Hello.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.760]   It's on my Facebook.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.840]   I'll find it.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.200]   Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balzilly.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.440]   There we go.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.840]   There's professionalism at work.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.880]   I don't know how to pronounce it.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.880]   Paul Silly.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   Paul Silly.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.880]   Paul Silly.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   Paul Silly.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880]   They're gone.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   Mike and Jim are gone.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.280]   Now the new CEO is Thorsten Heinz.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.280]   Oh.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.720]   You've run it very well.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.240]   He's a former chief operating officer.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.120]   And he has immediately said, "I am going to license the BlackBerry software to anyone
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120]   who wants it."
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.120]   Really?
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.120]   And nobody called.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.120]   Nobody called.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.800]   I think the wrong way to do it.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.480]   If you pay him, he won't license it.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.120]   People say, "Oh," he said, "literally."
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.280]   "Is this nuts?"
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.680]   "This is where BlackBerry RIM doesn't get their problem."
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.240]   "Oh, my solution.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.400]   I will fix the company."
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.760]   Anyone who wants to use the BlackBerry OS on their phone can use it.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.920]   Is this your like, vernahertz aug voice?
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   Okay.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.680]   And it's obvious that the thing they should do is completely the opposite.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.080]   They should start leasing either Android or Windows Phone 7 and start making BlackBerrys
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.880]   that use the other software.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   Is that right?
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.560]   I think the first interview that Thorsten gave, he was like, "Basically, there's nothing
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.440]   fundamentally wrong with the company with their real problem.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.480]   We've got a product issue if we just fix the products."
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.960]   And there was this massive sort of outcry at the beginning of last week of just like,
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.280]   "Oh, my God, if this guy got a clue."
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.320]   And now the financial post is new CEO.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.680]   I was dramatically different strategy.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.120]   And he's completely like in this Facebook.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.480]   He's like the Nokia guy.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   He's sort of nothing to see here to, "Oh, it's all going to completely change."
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.400]   But this guy's the COO.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.800]   So he's been in the middle of the complete.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   They needed somebody from the outside.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   Right.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.360]   At the last couple of years anyway.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.440]   So you usually need somebody new.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440]   Right.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.920]   I mean, everybody says they know how to solve BlackBerry's problem.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.600]   But I mean...
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.760]   Well, I don't know if I know how to solve it, but I clearly offering the license or software
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.440]   to other hardware manufacturers is not the way to make a lot of money.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.280]   He says, "At the very core of RIM is our innovation.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.840]   We always think ahead.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.600]   We always think forward.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.720]   Sometimes we think the unthinkable."
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   Which is what?
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   I don't know.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   It sounds like porn.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   It sounds like porn.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   Exactly.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.760]   Ah, we are thinking the unthinkable.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.160]   He put out a YouTube video to say this.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.960]   Shoot all users.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.200]   I think I would disagree with you that the new CEO, relatively new CEO at Nokia actually
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.680]   did the right thing, which is say we're going to make Windows mobile phones.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.880]   Don't you think that's going to save Nokia?
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.280]   You should see this 900 is...
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.360]   I have the 800, which is the 900 without the G4.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.360]   No, no.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.280]   The 900 is bigger and has a front-facing camera and has 4G.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.440]   I think the 900 is spectacular.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   It's great, isn't it?
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.520]   Yes, I've played with it.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   I've played with them.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.760]   She's given up on phones, right?
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.200]   Yeah, phones are BS.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.920]   So no, I've played with them and they're absolutely gorgeous, gorgeous.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   I think they're really nice.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.000]   And I think it's funny to see...
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.600]   And here's why I'm like, whatever, RIM, because you see, you know, we always kind of thought
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.400]   Windows mobile was going to be in the dust bin.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.040]   Nokia definitely in the dust bin.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   Yet here they come back to life like these Lazarus companies with these beautiful, beautiful,
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.120]   very competitive looking and feeling products.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.240]   So I'm not really willing to write RIM off yet.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.160]   They still have a very strong presence in the enterprise.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.080]   They are a legacy product.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.720]   So I'm not going to poop all over them yet.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.120]   Take a user, navigate, and see what you think.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.120]   Well, I agree.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   You mean that "auvey" thing?
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   Yeah, that's...
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   Well, I'm telling you.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.800]   I parked in front of the address.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.360]   For one thing, I was going to Oakland.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.560]   So I said, "Well, let me take the 800's, got an average."
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.560]   So it took me...
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.200]   It just started to take me on a while to goose chase.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   I said, "Wait a minute.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.360]   I know where this place has got where it looked on the map.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   I went and went there."
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.320]   Then I punched the number in again thinking it may have been some misspelling.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.560]   And I punched it in.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.240]   It showed me I was on York Street.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.280]   It showed me where I was on the map.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.840]   I put the address in which I was standing in front of.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.360]   And it says, "Okay, take off."
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.080]   It took me around the block and dropped me off on another street.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.040]   A block away, I'm thinking, "What kind of...
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   This is terrible."
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.920]   The Google Navigator is...
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.720]   The Android Navigator with the little picture at the end is the best thing in the world.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   I agree.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.120]   That's what you're competing against.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.920]   "Capend" in the chat room has a really good point, which is nobody really wants to license
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.920]   the RIM operating system.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.640]   But what if you could license the RIM email servo-tent?
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.640]   The P.E.S.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.120]   It's upgraded to iPhone, right?
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   No, I agree.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.120]   That's a product.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   I agree.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.160]   And the messenger as well, BBM, that everybody uses.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.160]   You're obsessed by it.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.160]   Yes.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.120]   If you could integrate BBM, B.E.S. into iPhone, Android, Windows, phone, that would be a business.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.120]   I agree.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.280]   And we're not talking about QNX or OS6.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.040]   We're talking about the server end.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   Why do people use Blackberry?
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   Because of BBM?
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   Pretty much.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.240]   And because of the secure server, businesses like it.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.480]   If you're a consumer, you love...
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.760]   If you're a teenage, you love BBM because it's instant chat.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.320]   If you're a business, you love B.E.S. because it's secure email.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.320]   Right.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.520]   And there's all this conversation around bringing your own device stuff for the enterprise.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.160]   And all the conversation around mobile enterprise is about security.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.440]   And I think that RIM definitely has a leg up there.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.120]   But if you're bringing your own phone, this is what happened, unfortunately, to RIM.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.600]   RIM was always the phone the boss gave you.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.320]   But if you got to bring your own phone, you wouldn't bring it to bring an iPhone or an
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   Android phone.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.200]   So there's a lot of confusing consumer apps and there's "fud" or "not fud", there's a concern
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.040]   about insecurity.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.680]   Not like, "Oh, do I look fat in this phone?"
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.880]   But like, "Is this phone going to crash my employer?"
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:27.440]   Of course, now we know that the Blackberry RIM already gave the back-end access to at
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.680]   least a couple of countries.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   I don't know.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.680]   Yes, they did.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   All right.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   All right.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   We're going to move on.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.280]   Oh, God.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.200]   John Rubenstein is leaving HP.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.800]   He was, boy, he didn't.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   You know what?
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.880]   I'm not sure this is another guy we would trumpet his great success.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.280]   He was at Palm.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:59.600]   He went Palm was running Palm when HP bought WebOS, ran the WebOS division, was responsible
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.720]   for the touch pad.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.040]   You can't, you know, this guy had a huge reputation.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.360]   He was at Apple, right?
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.360]   And then went off to do sidekick, right?
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:15.240]   And he's had a huge reputation and everything he's touched since then has just turned to
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   RIM.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   It's funny.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   There's a lot of guys that worked at, you see this as a Microsoft, guys too.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.120]   They leave Microsoft and they go someplace else or they leave Apple and they go someplace
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:30.560]   else and they don't have quite the supports or social structure that they were used to
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.840]   rely on and then now they're on their own.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   And very few of them are successful.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   That's interesting.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.320]   It's still his fault because he wasn't in the proper environment.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.400]   He had so much help from Apple.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.280]   You don't know sometimes when you're in a company that, you know, because you got one
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.880]   guy making the minor suggestion every once in a while who just so happens to be the perfect
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.360]   suggestion for you at that moment and you don't pay much attention to it.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.160]   He's saying there's cogs and machines.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.320]   Yeah, essentially.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.520]   But these are big machines that work a certain way and there are a lot of creative people
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.720]   in there, but that doesn't mean that they can be creative on their own.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.800]   That's like the freelance writer versus the guy who has to work in a big newspaper.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.840]   All things D's John Pachowski asked him, do you regret selling to HP?
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.040]   He said, I'm having anything to do with it.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.200]   He said, God bless it.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.760]   He said, this wasn't something where I had an opinion.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.080]   The process was carefully crafted as all acquisition processes are HP one.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.560]   I don't get an opinion on the subject.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.560]   I never did.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.880]   It sounds like you love HP.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   You love HP.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.760]   Yeah, he's bitter.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.400]   That's a big comment of a bitter person.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   He was not where he wanted to be.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.600]   So he says to the Verge, he says, in the Verge asking, you don't want to talk about Leo
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Apotheca.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.120]   And he says, you know what?
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.520]   We ended up at HP and HP wasn't in a good enough shape to be able to support us.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.920]   I have four CEOs.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:50.040]   Mark heard a choir that's named Kathy Les Jack to go over the interim CEO, CEO, then Leo
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.360]   Apotheca, that would make Whitman horrible in the space of 19 months.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.720]   Four CEOs in 19 months.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.360]   All things D said, what went wrong with the touch pad?
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.400]   Rubenstein says, well, it wasn't exactly given much time to find out, but I really don't
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.160]   want to rehash all that.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.160]   He's bitter.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.600]   He's really fun and it didn't for that interview.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   Good grief.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   That's bitter.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   It could have been done on email.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   He could have been drunk.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   Who knows?
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   He could have been.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.240]   So he says he's going to spend time with his family, but he's not retiring.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.560]   I'm sure he has some money, but he's not going to retire.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.040]   He's thinking about what he wants to do next.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.480]   He says, who knows what I'll do?
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.200]   Anything's possible.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.960]   I don't think he's going to be a hot commodity, but maybe.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.840]   That's the saddest interview, man.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.840]   You never know.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.240]   You've got to feel for the guy.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   He's absolutely right.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   We'll hit the nail on the head.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.560]   Yeah, I feel really sorry for him.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.760]   He's probably totally impoverished right now.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   No options.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.760]   No nothing.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   I really doubt that.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   I know, right?
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   I think he's partying with you.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   I think he's having a great time.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.360]   I think he's going to be millions of dollars.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.360]   Bagan for money.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.640]   He's going to be out there with a cup.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.640]   Feel sorry.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.640]   I don't think so.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   Oh.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.640]   Anywho.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.760]   Talk about something that's been going on for a long time in Silicon Valley.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:10.800]   Apparently, it's very common practice for tech companies to have deals, side deals, sometimes
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.080]   unwritten side deals with other tech companies, not to hire their employees.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:22.760]   For instance, Steve Jobs was angry when Google tried to hire an Apple employee.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.240]   He called Eric Schmidt, Schmidt said, whoa, we have an agreement that we will never poach
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.800]   Apple employees.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.040]   And he said, fire the guy who tried to recruit the Apple engineer.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:39.880]   Publicly, and then publicly Google's staffing director responded, the employee who contacted
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.360]   the Apple engineer will quote, "be terminated within the hour.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:49.320]   Please extend my apologies as appropriate to Steve Jobs."
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.680]   And they wanted a public flogging for the guy who dared to recruit somebody from Apple.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   It's disgusting.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.680]   Well, this is illegal.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:04.560]   And I didn't know this until I talked to a cousin who was a attorney law professor at
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.360]   Harvard and an expert on this.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.800]   No, this is so illegal.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.960]   It's just money in the bank for this employee.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.240]   This guy is an antitrust expert.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.640]   He's apparently done a lot of expert testimony in this kind of thing.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.600]   It's violates antitrust law.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   You cannot--
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.600]   No, you can't do that.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   Collude.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   Well, then why do they have--
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.200]   Didn't they all sign anti-poaching agreements a couple, maybe a year ago, maybe two years
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   ago?
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.720]   Well, and Apple and a couple of the other big companies got together and signed agreements.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.520]   I think they just did it orally.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   Here's--
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.520]   Well, here's--
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.160]   Because if you had a signed agreement, you could pull that out.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   These guys are in--
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.160]   Well, there's enough serious trouble.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.160]   There's smoking guns left.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.160]   All left and right, there's emails.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.480]   The court-- the reason-- now, this was settled a couple of years ago with the Department
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   of Justice.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.120]   The employees involved are now filing a class action lawsuit.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.960]   So all of the documents have been unsealed.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:59.240]   And among other things, you've got Paul Odalini, a Intel, CEO of Intel, saying, "Writing in an
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   email.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   Let me clarify.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   We have nothing signed.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.920]   We have a handshake, no recruit between Eric and myself.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.960]   I would not like this broadly known.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   They know perfectly well as--
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.920]   Well, what does Intel got to do with Google in the first place?
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.720]   Well, the reason you don't want-- you just don't want salaries to ratchet up because
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   it's--
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   It's fixed, yeah.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.480]   Yeah, it's fixing the value of an engineer.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.680]   So a good engineer who normally in a free market would be able to say, "You want to pay me more?
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.680]   I'm yours.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.720]   Can't do that because these companies are saying, "No, I'm not allowed to talk to you."
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.640]   Yeah, and these companies are the same ones that moan and groan about.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   We can't find anybody.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.200]   So bring an H1B in from India.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.360]   They can work cheap.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   They're cheap.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.840]   Well, I think that's it.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.880]   You can't find anybody that isn't already working for somebody else.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   Right.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.440]   No wonder you can't find anybody.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.840]   Now, this is-- this sort of thing is very annoying.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.200]   This is an union talk here.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:58.880]   Pixar is involved in this Apple Adobe Intuit, Intel, Google, all named in this class action
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.880]   lawsuit.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.360]   I love the way that Intuit is named and they're the same.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.360]   Well, you know why?
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.320]   I can't tell you why.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.840]   I can tell you why.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.680]   It's interlocking board of directors.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.120]   So Bill Campbell, who was president of Intuit, is on Apple's board.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.120]   Right.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.400]   Eric Schmidt is on Apple's board.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.240]   It's all interlocking directorates.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.360]   And that's what happens is these guys after the board meeting, they get together.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.360]   They have a couple of drinks.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.360]   So I want to hire you guys.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360]   You don't hire them.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.800]   It's closer to the truth than you can imagine.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   You've been there.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   I've seen it.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.040]   I'll pay another thing.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   You're a good guy.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   I love you.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.720]   You're a good guy.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.280]   I'm going to-- you're just great.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:46.320]   I remember we hired somebody from Revision 3 and Jim Laderbeck was a little irate.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   He was a pretty irate.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   Who was this?
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.320]   I won't say.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   Come on.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.320]   He said you're poaching my employees.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   And I said, yes.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:58.480]   And it would be just as illegal if I said to Jim Laderbeck, oh, sorry, I can't-- I won't
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.920]   hire anybody from Revision 3 again.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.080]   And you may not hire anybody from Twitter again.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.080]   Right.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.080]   What's the point?
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.280]   This is because you guys aren't even in the same zip code by any means.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   I mean, you're up here in the middle of nowhere.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.920]   I don't believe the law requires you to be in the same zip code.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.160]   But my point would be, well, if you're-- you want to keep an employee, pay them more.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.520]   But this is exactly what these guys don't want to do.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.520]   No.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.520]   Cheap.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   Cheap.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.960]   They pay themselves more, I might add.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.360]   So now they're all guessing in the chat room who it might be.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.440]   Veronica, I mean Tom, Sarah.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.440]   They know exactly.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:35.040]   I've hired some of my best people from other-- from competing companies.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.040]   Almost all of them.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   They're not really competing with you anyway.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.120]   No, we're all friends.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:45.160]   Jim did wasn't mad for very long.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:53.760]   The Apple says, "We care about every single employee who makes any Apple product.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.040]   But they are getting a lot of heat."
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   Now, I don't-- I think it's unfair to signal out Apple.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:04.200]   I think every bit of gear that we buy today is made by the same Chinese employees in the
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.600]   same factories as Foninan and Shenzhen factories.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.640]   But the times is all over Apple for this.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.960]   Something about the fact that for instance, workers assembling iPhones, iPads and other
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:24.280]   devices, labor and harsh conditions, excessive over time, some cases seven days a week, live
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:30.160]   in crowded dorms, some say they stand so long, their legs swell until they can hardly walk.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.680]   Underage workers help build Apple's products.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:41.800]   Apple did take, I think, appropriate step by finally disclosing their suppliers.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   They weren't even doing that.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.080]   It was several weeks ago, or a couple weeks ago, that Apple disclosed its list of suppliers
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:52.600]   and along with it, a fairly detailed report on each kind of abuse they found in each factory
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.920]   that they visited.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:59.520]   I was surprised that there were some that had indentured type-- they had slave labor and
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.520]   child labor.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.400]   I was surprised, not too surprised, that they didn't immediately sever any business
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:09.280]   relationship with all those plants that were employing people that way.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.120]   Well, I mean, again, they're a business.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.120]   There's no morality.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.720]   They don't think it's possible.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.320]   That's where the Times jumps in and they start talking about this.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.520]   Well, they made a human story out of it.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   Right.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.520]   Jim Cook.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.520]   Which I think I was reading it and I'm seeing these statistics.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.760]   Like there are explosions, there's child labor, there are people involved, which Apple
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.640]   can't afford to think about.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.480]   Jim Cook writes, "Some people are questioning Apple's values today.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.400]   Any suggestion that we don't care is patently false and offensive to us as you know better
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   than anyone."
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   And he's writing to the Apple employees.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.440]   Accusations like this are contrary to our values.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.560]   It's not who we are.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.920]   So the question is, what are they going to do about it?
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   And I think you're right, John.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.080]   Here's what I'd love Apple to do.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.760]   We've talked about this a little bit before.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.200]   I would love them to offer products as a choice.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.680]   They don't have to make them all this way.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   But say you could buy an iPhone for 25% more, you could buy an iPhone made in the US.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.800]   Like organic fruit and fair tree diamonds.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   Exactly.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   Okay.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.520]   I think it's patently false and offensive for Apple to suggest that that company or any
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.680]   technology company has any kind of morality at all or any values other than make it cheap,
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:16.240]   make a shit ton of them, excuse my language, and sell them to everybody you can.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.560]   Those are their values.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.000]   They don't care.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   No one can.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.360]   So you're saying that when Google says do no evil, when Apple says do you have values,
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.360]   you don't believe it.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.640]   It's all PR.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.000]   And it is what it is.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   You know what?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   In America, 200 years ago, we had the same labor conditions now we don't.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.120]   Because we can't, as we've previously discussed, live our lives without computers and phones
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.320]   and microphones and whatever else you want to buy.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.400]   All of this stuff comes from China.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.240]   All of it's made in this way.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.400]   Why are we so surprised that there are human stories behind it?
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.880]   Why does it take a human story to get us pissed off?
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880]   That bothered me.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:57.280]   Well, the truth is I think every single person who buys products made in China knows in their
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:02.880]   heart of hearts that the American standards are probably not applied to Chinese workers.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.280]   But I think we don't want made in America iPhones.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.280]   Like that's a good idea.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   Give us an opportunity.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.680]   There have been studies that say it wouldn't cost as, you know, it costs very little more.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.000]   But I'll be to be honest about it.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.560]   Let me ask you just a just a gratuitous question.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:23.840]   Would you rather buy a Lexus made in South Carolina or a Lexus made just outside of Tokyo
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   in the Tokyo plant?
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.280]   Well, but well, I don't think Tokyo Japanese workers are mistreated.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   Are they?
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.920]   No, I'm just asking this question.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.680]   The Tokyo plant, because I like the robots.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.960]   You like to know you like the quality.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   Is there a difference?
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   What do you think?
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.000]   I'll be honest, when I bought my Lexus in 2001, I did not inquire.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   It was probably made in Japan.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.320]   I think it was made in Japan, but I did not inquire.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.840]   And maybe I should have inquired, but I didn't even think to inquire.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.880]   I have to say I haven't seen a massive because I mean, Apple used to make their stuff in
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.880]   the States.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.680]   Steve jumps very famously insisted on that.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.680]   Robotic quality.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   No, Steve insisted.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.560]   He didn't insist that hard.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.480]   They remember this is the story in the biography.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.920]   I had to paint all the machines were painted.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.120]   There was one that was painted blue that never worked right again that he had he bought
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.400]   very expensive furniture.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.680]   He had these American factories.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.280]   The original apples were made in America.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:21.240]   I think the I believe the original Macs were made for a long time in America.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.280]   So he might have cared, but I think when the when the problem is when you need to make
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.960]   50 million of them, you can't make it.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.160]   More people are specializing in phones.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:36.680]   Next, next, I guess, I guess what one of the points that was being made, I think that
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.840]   the sort of came out of the Steve jobs made to Obama was that you can't, you can add
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.520]   the cost of the labor and say in the cost of the components and say, okay, it's going
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.320]   to cost you, you know, 10% or 20% more to make these things in America.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:56.320]   What you can't do is have a production line that will just kind of run with sort of half
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.680]   a minute's notice and just absolutely churn through these things in the same way that
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.720]   you can in the far east because the labor laws mean, you know, you won't be able to
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:07.560]   work like 13 hour shifts or 16 hour shifts and be able to work, you know, seven days
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.560]   a week, 24/7.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:13.240]   And then it's only by the sort of Eastern manufacturing processes.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.560]   So the story goes that Apple can have these amazing sort of time to markets of, you know,
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.800]   design something and have it.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   It's not just profit.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   It's time to market.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   Well, there's that.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:27.840]   There's also one element I'll go back up Jolie on this, which is the, the Japanese or this
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.400]   Chinese are actually probably selling stuff for more than you, we know about.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.840]   I mean, they can make stuff incredibly cheap over there.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.960]   And at some point it comes to the board and somebody says, what, because somebody will
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:44.320]   present them with this and they say, look, you can be making an extra $10 in iPhone and
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.360]   we're selling 30 million of them.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   That's a lot of money.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   A lot of money.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.160]   And why are we making them here?
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.520]   And then you have to, and you're the CEO or whoever and you have to answer that question.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   We got to make it.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.920]   Well, because they got child labor over there.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.200]   And it comes to your point about, you know, you have a responsibility, a fiduciary responsibility
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   to your shareholders.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   Yeah, a different word.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.800]   When someone shows you a graph with a line that goes a little bit higher, you say yes
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.000]   to China.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.440]   But you could also, and this is the thing is it's not a clear cut decision because as
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.360]   you pointed out, making customers happy is also a fiduciary responsibility.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.880]   If customers are saying to you, we will use your, give me a break.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   That's why we need to raise awareness.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.840]   Well, that's why Apple put out this big report like, oh, we know this is going on and we're
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.600]   working with companies to remediate this thing.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.120]   That was a big PR piece, whatever.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.320]   I don't know if they're doing anything or what they're doing, but only because Apple
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.600]   sells so much product and buys so much product from China, can they put pressure on those
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.120]   companies to change?
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.600]   And can they amplify any pressure workers might be putting on employers to change working
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.600]   conditions?
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.200]   But this is, this goes back to like labor law.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.200]   Right.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.560]   We have, you know, we're indignant, we're Americans, we're extremely privileged.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:55.800]   We didn't have these labor laws 200 years ago, or, you know, some of them even 70 years
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   ago.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   That's true.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.280]   Someone in the chat mentioned Upton Sinclair, and yeah, I think we need to act in Sinclair
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   for this.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   The jungle.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   But it's not going to be New York.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:07.520]   But that's why I think the apples would say, well, we're going to stay in these countries
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.080]   and we're going to push for improved labor laws.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.760]   We're raising the standards of living and now we want to raise the standards of labor
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:19.800]   in China and the countries that we work in, Brazil, for instance, they just built a new
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.240]   plan in Brazil.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.920]   And that is like that old, I will change the system from within.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.840]   We're better off being there and impacting it.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.000]   Do you change the system or do you integrate it and become part of it?
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Well, it's probably very tempting.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   Are we enabling the system?
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.920]   It's probably very tempting to be to say, well, just take the profits.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.680]   But I know what you're saying, but I do also think yes, corporates are amoral, but they're
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.480]   made of people who are moral and who do have values.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.120]   And so I think it's some some, I'm not saying all.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.920]   I think there's these smitherers.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   What is his name?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.920]   Yes, mithers.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.200]   Mr. Burns is there's a Mr. Burns.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:59.160]   Well, I think you think his intel makes all of chips in the US.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.520]   I'm pretty sure it will be.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.880]   That's but there's a lot that has a lot to do with security laws in this country.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:08.600]   We have a there's a lot of there's a lot of laws that are put in place by the NSA and
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:13.360]   the CIA about how to certain kinds of chips can't really be made someplace else.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.560]   So and I don't think they make all their chips.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.560]   Good conversation.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.560]   We're going to talk more.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.960]   How much would you pay to get in on the Facebook IPO?
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.320]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.120]   But first, let me talk to the small business owners out there.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.240]   It's fun being it's fun running your own businesses fund.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.240]   It's hilarious.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.880]   It's a laugh a minute.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.720]   I enjoy what are you showing there?
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   Hello.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.920]   There's just a bird.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.400]   I enjoy I enjoy running my own business.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.120]   But there are some things I do not enjoy, especially when I first started.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.560]   I did not enjoy invoicing.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:54.120]   But as we all know, if you do not bill, you do not get paid.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:58.960]   And that's why in 2004, when Amber MacArthur told me about FreshBooks, I jumped and I
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.920]   love it and I've used it ever since.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.720]   It's the easy online invoicing service for small business.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.920]   It saves you time.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.040]   More maybe more importantly gets you paid more quickly.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.120]   Over three and a half million FreshBooks users know.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:19.720]   You could try the service free for 30 days of unlimited use right now at freshbooks.com.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.400]   So here's the deal.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.960]   Creating the invoices you could do in Word.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.200]   I mean, a lot of you have ways to do this.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.840]   FreshBooks, you upload your logo.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.040]   You've got great software.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.760]   It handles all the currencies, by the way, which is great.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:36.680]   But even if you say, "Well, I can do all that," here's the beauty part.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.000]   You email your invoice.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.640]   Your customers can print it as a PDF.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.840]   If you pay an additional fee, FreshBooks will also print, stamp, and mail it as well.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.960]   But you want them to do the invoicing via email because there's a button on the invoice
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.680]   that says, "Pay right now."
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.760]   And your clients can press that button and play with a credit card.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.080]   They can even set it up and you can set it up so you automatically invoice and automatically
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.320]   get paid.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.120]   It is really the way to make invoicing streamlined, fast, and efficient.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:08.160]   There's automatic features like if you don't get paid, you can have a 30, 60, 90-day response
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.400]   that's automatic.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.840]   If you do time and hours, your time sheets are automatically entered into the invoice.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.200]   They have an app for the iPhone.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.160]   They have a web-based app as well.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.160]   There's just so many nice features.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.520]   I want you to try it free right now.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.160]   30 days of unlimited use.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.240]   All the features, clients, staff, everything, no limits just by signing up at FreshBooks.com.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.240]   Tell me about it on Twitter if they ask.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.520]   Again, it's not advertising the site.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.640]   This is something that we do for you here.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   That's some inside information.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.360]   But if you sign up right now, they will not charge you for 30 days of unlimited use.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.320]   So sign up for everything, all the features, all the clients.

[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.360]   I'm a big fan.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.680]   Fortunately, I have people to do that for me now.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.440]   I don't have to worry about that anymore.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.160]   Boy, that was a pain.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.160]   Facebook.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.160]   Now, it's a rumor.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.160]   It's been in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.280]   It's been in the New York Times.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.440]   But Facebook supposedly will file an IPO.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.120]   You know how I know this is true?
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   Wow.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:16.200]   I saw a post, I think it was on path from L'Oeek Le Mer, the world famous French entrepreneur.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.200]   Your buddy.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   My bud.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.200]   Nothing.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.200]   Go ahead.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   What?
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.760]   He's biting an orange.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   My bud.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   How else do you get the orange started?
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   No, that's the only way.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   Finger nails.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.760]   It's biting right there.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.560]   You know, there's a couple of people I know that when I do that, they get grossed out or
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.720]   they start to get the shivers.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   I'm shaking.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.720]   No, I don't care.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.720]   Go ahead and bite.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.720]   You know why?
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.040]   Because there's a, isn't there an explosive juice in the rind?
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.760]   Can't you like light it on fire and the oil?
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.760]   No, that's orange.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   You know oil.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.760]   It's really delicious.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.760]   Yeah, it's really delicious.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.600]   And they use it to kill termites.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.200]   You can spray it on ants with a little, take a match and then you squeeze the thing and
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.400]   then this sprays go out and burns into the ants' kitchen on fire.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   You did that?
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.400]   With the kid when I was a kid.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   Wow.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.400]   Now we know a little bit about shot.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.920]   I think we need to take a break.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.520]   Oh my God.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.320]   We just took a break so we're going to come back.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.520]   So I was talking about Facebook, right?
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.520]   Blood orange.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.520]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.520]   I was at Facebook.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.160]   You can tell me your anecdote that we'll confirm this.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.320]   Let's talk about L'Oeek first.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   He was no comment.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:21.280]   Davos, which is the world economic forum, right?
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.000]   Cheryl Sandberg is there.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   Scobo went once.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Scobo's still there.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.400]   Scobo goes every year.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.480]   Scobo Bono, Mick Jagger and...
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.400]   Because they're all on the plane.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.400]   I thought the around is Scobo.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   Because he was annoying.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   He isn't.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.240]   No, he was filming everybody.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.480]   No, JC, everybody's there.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   I don't know.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   I thought Scobo went this year.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.480]   I thought he went once and then...
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.880]   Because he never let him back?
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.920]   Because he's always had Robert Scobo.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:45.920]   Who are you?
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.920]   And he's pointing the camera in their face.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.760]   Hey, what's your name?
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.760]   I love Robert.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.760]   We all love Robert.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.760]   We all love Robert.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:56.920]   Anyway, L'Oeek says to Cheryl, "Congratulations on the IPO."
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   Because he's trying to get...
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.400]   He says like on the internet or with his word.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   No.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.400]   Face to face, talking to her.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   Okay.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.840]   So you, do you want to be him or do you want to...
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.400]   Well, I'm going to read his post because I don't know.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   I wasn't there so I don't know.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   You guys going to do a little play here from it?
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.960]   Just like no video of it.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:18.000]   But basically, he says she gave him a very broad, happy smile.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   Not like...
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Like an FU smile?
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   No, like a...
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Like I'm going to be so rich.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   I am rich, baby!
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.080]   Now, like she didn't do not.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.720]   And not like a smile like I can't say anything.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.440]   Smile that only comes from money.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.760]   Like that kind of smile.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.760]   So that's not proof.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.760]   I'm not saying it's proof.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.760]   Did the week tell you that?
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.760]   He put it on path.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.760]   I probably shouldn't have even been to that.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:40.760]   Oh.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.760]   I have it too late.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.760]   But I isn't path for...
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:43.760]   No.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.760]   Like share with a private small...
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.760]   Now Leo.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.760]   That's what happens when you put your private...
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:53.200]   So now the whole internet knows that Cheryl Sandberg is really excited about Facebook's
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   IPO.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   Well, they're filing it.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.000]   She said not a word.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   But I'm thinking...
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   What?
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.040]   I'm putting my money on it that it's this week that they will have an IPO.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   What do you...
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   No, they weren't there.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.040]   There's no way.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.040]   I was there.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.040]   I'm not doing a new campus.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.040]   It is as big as a shopping mall.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.040]   It's so big.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   Not do the IPO, but it's so big.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:10.040]   Okay.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.040]   It's huge.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.040]   It's so huge.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.520]   And the parking lot is like a diagonal airport parking lot.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.520]   It's enormous.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.520]   Anyways, I was there.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.640]   And I said so.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.240]   There's a trimmer in whatever it was called.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   So it's called?
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.240]   It's like if it's a journal, it's a trimmer.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.640]   Oh, it's a rumor and nobody knows.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.640]   But no, we knew...
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.160]   If it's news of the world, it's a rumor.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.880]   But if it's a Wall Street Journal, it's a trimmer.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.880]   Right.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.880]   That boy, rumor, journal, slightly less.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.880]   News of the world in the US is very different from news in the world in the UK, by the way.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.960]   Anyways, do I haven't we known for some time that the IPO was coming in 2012?
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:41.960]   Some time.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   I think there's illegal reasons they have to do it.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:44.960]   Yeah, SEC type reasons.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.960]   Yeah, they have to do it.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.320]   Oh, it was because they got more shareholders.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.320]   They're on shareholders.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.320]   Right.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.320]   Is it more than 5,000 shareholders?
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:57.160]   Because they have at least that many employees and ex-employees and then private shareholders
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.880]   who bought stock on the private secondary market.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:04.280]   Once you cross a threshold, the SEC requires you to go public it with, if you have enough
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   shareholders.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.760]   And you know what?
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.160]   They hit that 500 shareholders limit before last spring I happened to know.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.160]   So they have a year.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.920]   They've halted all sales of private stock.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.160]   So they have to file.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:21.160]   So if it's this week, it'll be like big, friggin' surprise, worst kept secret in Silicon
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.800]   Valley, whatever.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.760]   Now, when they file the IPO...
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.160]   I want to know why we're talking about this.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.520]   Oh, this is a huge story.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:33.080]   This is going to be the biggest tech IPO since that's the game.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.920]   Would you want... wouldn't you want to get in on this?
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:35.920]   No.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:36.920]   Would you not want to buy stock?
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   No.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   No, no.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.480]   You know, I invest for the long term.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.280]   I mean, I'm not a day trader type.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.920]   I invest in things that are going to be valuable in 30 years.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:45.920]   It's going to be valuable tomorrow.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.600]   It's going to be valuable in five hours after it goes on.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.400]   Yeah, but who knows?
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.680]   Because the thing about tech stock, you never know when it's going to take that turn.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.680]   You can't anticipate it.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.680]   You can't predict it.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.680]   No, you sell it the next day.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.680]   You could.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.680]   But I can't speculate like that.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:02.400]   Look, it will here has just made millions of dollars selling his company.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.960]   He knows all about it.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   I don't know how much you made.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   So if you...
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.520]   Millions really are Goldman's customers.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.520]   You would know.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.520]   You can extrapolate.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:11.520]   I can't extrapolate.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.520]   I don't know how much I owned.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.520]   You can.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.520]   You can.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.520]   We're back here again.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.320]   We're talking about your hammermen.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.120]   What percentage did he have?
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.120]   People.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.120]   People.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   If you had gold just wondering...
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   I don't know.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.640]   And if you were in that IPO, you could get, you know, pre-IPO stock and you could flip
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:32.240]   it maybe 10 seconds after an IPO is for double the amount it's going to be.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Exactly.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.040]   It's going to double within 30 seconds.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.280]   And that's why it's so reprehensible that the companies...
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:44.040]   I think Morgan Stanley is going to be the lead underwriter with Goldman Spack's, paying
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:46.000]   a second roll, secondary roll.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:52.880]   That means that if you are a special customer of these brokerages, you often get...
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.880]   What do they call it?
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.880]   There's a word...
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.880]   Like a sweetheart deal.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:56.880]   Yeah, you get a sweetheart deal.
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.440]   You get to buy in before it hits the open market, which means you're buying in at the
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.440]   strike price.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.440]   The initial price is on a hot...
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.440]   Yeah, on a hot...
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.800]   Oh yeah, it'll last for 10 seconds.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.080]   Now with Groupon, you might have lost a lot of money, but...
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.920]   But, Google, it was tripled within...
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.720]   If you bought Groupon, the IPO...
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.720]   You still made money.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.720]   Well, you were idiot.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.880]   You still made 30 or 40 percent within a couple of minutes.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.880]   Right.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.400]   But I mean, capitalism isn't supposed to be fair, is it?
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   I mean, the rich get richer, and that's what deals like that are about.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400]   It's supposed to be fair.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   So the company reportedly seeking to raise 10...
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   You can keep it right.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   ...the 10...
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.400]   ...crony capitalism isn't.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.400]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.400]   This is crony capitalism.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.400]   This is a...
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.400]   This is a crony capitalism.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   Crony capitalism is not fair.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.400]   Because of who you know, you get special access to the money.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.040]   That is not what capitalism is.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.400]   You're supposed to work hard, create a value, innovate...
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.800]   You still think that?
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   And the market...
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.800]   This is a fact, the market will reward.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800]   It just doesn't work.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   I'm like...
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.800]   You're going to have to give me some...
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   No, I'm not.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.800]   You have...
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.800]   You pitched for the business.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.800]   So in a sense...
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   How am I naive?
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   I'm talking about that.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   So this is by the way why I thought it was very interesting.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.800]   Google, Google remember, did an auction.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.800]   And avoided...
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.800]   I think they avoided this kind of crony capitalism.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.800]   They did a very interesting deal with San Francisco firm, and I'm forgotten the name.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:23.800]   It was hand-bracked.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   Yeah, hand-brick and quest.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.800]   No, it was just hand-brick.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.800]   It was hand-brick.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   It was built all by himself now.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.800]   And it was a very clever way of avoiding...
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.800]   They wanted to avoid this whole issue of insider.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.800]   Well, here's the problem that you run into.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.800]   These companies get screwed by the system.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   Well, that's the other side of it.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.800]   Yeah, that's the main part of it.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:52.800]   You bring out an IPO with the $10 million, let's say, and the stock triples making the offering
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   potentially worth 30 million.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   So you want to do it as a Dutch auction.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   So you get all that money instead of some speculators who just get in early and they make a quick killing.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.800]   These firms don't like that, of course, because they can't give their buddies some deal.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   And that's why they're not Dutch auctions.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   You don't seem that often.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.800]   Well, I was actually looking up a Dutch auction.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   I think it has nothing to do with the Dutch.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.800]   Is it like a Dutch oven or something?
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   Google's, which was back in 2004, was the largest IPO ever, 1.9 billion.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.800]   Facebook's talking about 10 billion.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.800]   Yeah, it seems a little high.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   Google did, in fact, because of this auction, they thought they were going to go off at $108 to $135.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   They ended up going off at $85 a share.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.800]   But of course, what is Google now?
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.800]   Almost 600, something like that.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800]   400?
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   No, it's 6 something.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   It may be under $6 now.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   And they may have been split in between then.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   No.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   Google's never done a split.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   $5.79.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   Yes, sir.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.800]   They've never done a split.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   So, Facebook's, if they do $10 billion, would value the company at between $75 and $100 billion?
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.800]   Does that sound right?
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.800]   No.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800]   Oh, God, who can tell?
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   Yes, no.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   No.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   Well, same thing.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   Who can tell?
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.800]   That's a tie, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800]   I'm going to break the tie.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   I remember when Google IP, it was like really $85.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.800]   That's a lot of money for like a search engine stock.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   Of course, if you bought it then, you know, ten years later or whatever it is, you're
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   laughing.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   So I think Facebook is just getting started.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   I honestly think it could go to two, three, four times that in the next decade.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   I would agree in one way or not in the other.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   Of course, they've got 800 million members.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.800]   You can't get much bigger.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   There's only what?
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   Two billion people on the Internet.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   Not even that.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   So they've almost got everybody.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800]   They're saturing.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   But if you look at what Google, if you look at what Facebook does in terms of monetization.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   That's where they haven't, they just got started.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800]   Exactly.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   Well, they're also just getting started with Facebook credits.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   And I think from talking to them, I think that's their biggest area of opportunity.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   Ads are going to become maybe even secondary as Facebook credits.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   You know, we think of them as something you use to play Farmville.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   Eventually, they'll be something you can use in the real world.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   Exactly.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.800]   It's cash.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.800]   They will own the new currency.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   Are you kidding?
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   Mm-hmm.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.200]   And it'll be a global currency.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200]   It's the next Euro.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   No, I agree with you 100% will.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   They've saturated--
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200]   Not the next year, right?
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200]   Well, let's hope it's better than that.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.200]   They've saturated the potential audience, but they've barely, barely scratched the surface.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.800]   Scratching them out of their money.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   Yeah, right.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.800]   They're all squeezing us and squeezing us until they get every drop of goodness.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.800]   Excellent.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.800]   So will this-- Mark Zuckerberg, this guy, is going to be-- he's got what?
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.800]   5%.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.800]   No, he's got at least 25%.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   25%.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   So this guy's going to be immediately Warren Buffett class billionaire.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.800]   He's going to be one of the top five richest people in the world.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   Immediately.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   Like, boom.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   Is it going to change Facebook, though?
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.800]   He's always said, I don't want investors.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.800]   I don't want a board, you know, outside investors.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.800]   Yeah, he's got one now.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.800]   He wanted to keep Facebook private, and certainly he has very much influenced the direction of
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.800]   Facebook.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   He's been able to run that company.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800]   Is it going to change it?
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.800]   Yeah, I think big time.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.720]   In fact, my son, who's a student of Facebook and Zuckerberg in particular, says that as
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:14.800]   far as he's concerned, Zuckerberg is a genius, and they're taken away as power very slowly.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   There's a lot of new ideas showing up on Facebook.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:22.120]   They're definitely not Zuckerberg's ideas, and they're going to end up screwing it up,
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.040]   because Zuckerberg's not a very aggressive person.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.800]   He's like an Asperger's guy.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   He's almost like a Gates character.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.800]   Definitely.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.800]   Definitely.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:35.160]   And he's going to lose control.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.480]   I think that's exactly right.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:43.160]   I think, you know, the one thing that Zuckerberg has always been very canny about doing is
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.800]   making incremental changes, doing things quite slowly.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.160]   You know, it's taken a long time for Facebook monetization to get to where it is now, to
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.800]   the point, you know, we still, or do we just have ads now in the newsfeed?
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.400]   I'm like, that's been a long time coming.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.400]   And I admire that.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.960]   The thing is you can do that when you're a private company, when you're a public company,
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.320]   you know, as we were saying earlier, you know, it's like right now you have a fiduciary
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.000]   duty to make as much money as evenly possible as quickly as possible.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.400]   And that could be a massive step change for Google, but Facebook.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400]   I do.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400]   I think so.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400]   And I think maybe not a change for the best.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400]   So maybe you're right, Jolie.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.720]   Well, how long did it take Google to make that change for making good products that people
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.680]   love to making products that are kind of kind of creepy, maybe a little bit.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   So maybe it's not the least I would say a few years.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.880]   I don't think they're making creepy products.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.560]   You just said you're nobody's fanboy and I like Google.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.360]   No, that's somebody there said nobody's fanboy.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.600]   I'm a big fanboy of this navigation product on the Google phone.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.240]   I agree that one works.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.880]   I like when you pull up and there's a picture of the building.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   I know.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880]   Is that neat?
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.880]   Yeah, but it's also creepy.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.880]   That's creepy.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.880]   But it is cool.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.040]   Especially if you can see people coming out to greet you.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.800]   It's cool and creepy at the same time.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.600]   That's Google right in a nutshell.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   Well, that's going to be Facebook.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.080]   Already is Facebook a little bit.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.080]   Creepy at the same time.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.880]   And then something better is going to come on.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.920]   Staying in the chat room says that Mark Zuckerberg is going to end up like Jerry Yang.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.920]   Oh, that's sad.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920]   That could happen.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.000]   Kind of keeps himself out of the picture.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.800]   So a lot of people like Cheryl Samberg will become billionaires probably.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.880]   You know who's going to become a billionaire?
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.560]   Sean Parker has 5% of Facebook.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:24.000]   That's 3.5, 3-20 billion.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.440]   You know what's cool, Liam?
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.440]   What?
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.440]   A billion dollars.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.400]   He said that in the movie, didn't he?
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.400]   You're absolutely right.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   He got his billion.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.480]   He got his billion.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480]   Got his billion.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.480]   No.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.000]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.040]   If you step back a little bit and we're really in it and we all have opinions about Facebook
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.520]   and privacy and what kind of person Zuck is and all of that stuff.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520]   Zuck?
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.520]   I call him Zuck.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.520]   Okay.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:53.520]   We're allowed to.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.120]   If you eat the meat, you get to call him Zuck.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.800]   So if you take all that away and you just think that this was a company started by a Harvard
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.840]   sophomore about 10 years ago, right?
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.080]   Not even that.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.080]   Not even that.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.080]   No.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:16.320]   That's a value that has been created by this one company in such a short time is stunning
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.440]   and it could only happen in this technology.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.480]   There's no factory spewing smoke.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:25.600]   There's no Chinese indentured servants.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.920]   It's almost a virtual company.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:32.360]   It's bits and the value that he's created out of nothing is mind-boggling.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.560]   Can we have a clip of that?
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   Sure.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.560]   Clip that thing.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:40.680]   I mean, all of the other stuff aside, it really is truly incredible.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.600]   It's inspiring and you also have to think about the environmental impact.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.880]   If you don't want to talk about that, that's okay.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   Servers, you mean?
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.880]   And they are doing a lot in the way of data center, optimization.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880]   They're trying to be green and servers.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   But yeah.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   They are.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.840]   And they're doing really good work with their open sourcing of their hardware specs.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.080]   But I think there are always underbellies when you are building a company.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:05.520]   But I would submit that's almost a sunk fixed cost because if it weren't for you, you
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.520]   know, Facebook, it would be somebody else.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.320]   It all we're saying is people who are using the internet are using a lot of power.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.240]   But if they weren't using Facebook, they'd be using.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.240]   I don't think they would.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240]   No.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   If they weren't using Facebook, they'd be outside writing their bicycles.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.240]   I disagree.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.680]   Facebook invites you to and gains you to.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.680]   Are you kidding?
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.680]   Are you silly?
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   Of course they do.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.240]   Because it's their number one thing that they want to do.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.960]   They want to get you to spend more time on the site so they can understand you and serve
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   you ads.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.960]   That's their fiduciary response.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.960]   I understand.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   They're wildly successful at that.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.320]   We think that absent Facebook, we wouldn't be even on the internet.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.560]   We wouldn't be on the internet as much.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.560]   Maybe 10 to 20 percent.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.720]   Some people are on Facebook all the time.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.440]   They're just on Facebook.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.440]   It's what they do.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   And it's how they connect with their friends.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.440]   Well, if that's the case, then you're absolutely right.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.440]   Facebook has a responsibility.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.480]   If it weren't for Facebook, you would be seeing your friends in person.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.480]   So there is a...
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.480]   Fiving to see them.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.480]   In my...
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.640]   And my cool burning car.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.880]   There is a study that just came out just as we're being reported today for out of Stanford.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:04.080]   And they're finding a reverse correlation between people around Facebook a lot and their social
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.080]   life.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.400]   That's deteriorating by the minute.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.080]   Well, the more you're on Facebook, the more of an introverted weirdo you become.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.040]   It could be destroying the country.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.240]   That's you Old Farts definition of a social life.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.600]   My social life is great.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.520]   I'm hanging out with my friends in Farmville.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.520]   I'm fighting...
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.520]   Oh, here we go.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.520]   Skyrae.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.920]   I mean, count me as an Old Fart.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.560]   I mean, I have a wonderful time with my friends in the world.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.560]   Well, thank you.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:27.580]   Especially with the F
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:31.580]   Yeah, you can see that on the first part.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.580]   We gang up.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.580]   It's not going to happen.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.080]   Young and old Old Farts.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.480]   Yeah, that's a really interesting point, Jolie, that I actually hadn't really thought
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.480]   about that you think that Facebook could say...
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.480]   I challenge you go without Facebook for a few days and see how much...
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.480]   I hate it all the time, but I use Google+.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480]   I use other stuff.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.480]   Okay.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.280]   Look, I'm online all the time, so I can't judge.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.280]   You're a mess, sir.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.280]   I'm a mess.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   But I do think it's an interesting supposition that without Facebook, we'd use the internet.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.280]   You say 20% less.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.480]   10 to 20, I think.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480]   The average person.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.240]   Chat room, does that sound right?
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.240]   Would you use the internet 20% less?
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.040]   Yeah, and like bald speculation based on nothing sound right to you guys.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.360]   The chat room is nuts.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.600]   They live in the chat room.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.560]   Yeah, these guys are completely...
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.560]   They use it all the time.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.840]   Most of these guys can't even find the front door of their house anymore.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.520]   I'm seeing yes, no.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:23.400]   I would bet at least half of them are wearing catheters right now.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   No.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.480]   With Diet Coke going in.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.480]   No, I'm just curious.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480]   I mean, you're right.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.480]   The chat room probably.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.720]   Because these guys, these are hard...
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.640]   Guys and gals are hard core internet users.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.200]   Probably absent Facebook.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.200]   But I don't know if you can blame Facebook for all of that extra internet use.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200]   I don't know if that...
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.200]   I think we would use the internet in some other way.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.400]   If Facebook hadn't been created, we would have had it.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.240]   Not without the mechanisms they've created to keep you on.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.880]   They have very, very powerful mechanisms to keep you on and to get your friends to sign
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880]   up for it too.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   You agree, Will?
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.080]   I think one of the most important things about Facebook over the next sort of five years,
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.040]   the next phase of Facebook is actually the sort of mass decentralization of Facebook.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.800]   So what I want you to think about Facebook now is something you go on and do.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.800]   Right.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   Facebook everywhere.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.240]   Facebook now is going to start to be like just something that is...
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.200]   You're somewhere on the web and it's already that you're commenting on Facebook.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.320]   You're logged in to get your personalized preferences for particular site on Facebook.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.280]   Somebody in the chat room was saying, "What's the bet that Facebook credits will be legal
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.200]   tender in 7-11 within the next five years?"
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.200]   I think so.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.960]   So Facebook is not going to be something that you do.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.000]   It's just going to be something that's just part of your life, like your wallet or your
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   wallet.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   And Will, what you're talking about, that's exactly what they're going for.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   That's their strategy.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   That's their business.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Facebook everywhere.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   To make Facebook the internet synonymous.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   They want it to be all the same.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.600]   I, for one, welcome to leaders from Facebook.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600]   I love that.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.600]   You know what?
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.600]   Brian in the chat room says that I'm nuts.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.600]   No.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.920]   In Zuck, we trust.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.720]   I admit it's working on me because remember I left Facebook about a year ago because I
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.440]   was so upset with their privacy policy.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.440]   You put it?
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.160]   And I came back and now I love it.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.080]   Did they give you the shot or the chip?
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.080]   What shot?
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.080]   I love Facebook.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.560]   She scanned for chips so it has to be the shot.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.560]   You know what I really like?
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.560]   Maybe it was the shock.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.240]   And they turned this on this week.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.240]   Everybody's getting timeline.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.240]   I love it.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.240]   It is pretty, isn't it?
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.240]   It's more than pretty.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240]   It's awesomeness.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.240]   A lot of people hate timeline.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   Who hates timeline?
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.240]   People.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.240]   Only people hate life.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.240]   Oh, everyone.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.240]   Okay.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.240]   I talked to the guy who designed it.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.240]   One of the guys who led the design team for it and he said that they looked at...
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.240]   Same lesson.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.240]   I love him.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.240]   In the world.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.880]   He said that they looked at scrapbooks and like physical mementos that are strongly tied
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.040]   to memory and reminiscence.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040]   This is like a scrap.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.040]   It is.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040]   It's supposed to make you nostalgic.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.040]   It does.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.120]   Why do you want to be made in a style?
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.840]   I go all the way back to my birth on this.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.840]   People live in the past.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.640]   And you can see me as a baby when I tell you.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.440]   Oh, you're such a two baby.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.440]   I want to see that.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:43.440]   See?
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.440]   I don't want to see it.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.840]   But I would submit this and I would ask Sam about it.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.840]   By the way, Sam...
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.840]   You're such a cute baby.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.840]   Sam is a great guy to run.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.040]   We don't even know that's really him.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.040]   You're right.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.040]   It's a stock photo.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.040]   It's my naivetete.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040]   I got the best to eat John.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.520]   A stock photo from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.320]   Look, if you go to 2003 you'll find a picture of me from the screen savers.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.720]   So here's the thing that I find interesting.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.080]   I would love what Sam's take on this.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.520]   By the way, if you ever get a chance to play "Wear Wolf", he's a great "Wear Wolf" leader.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520]   Sam is...
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.520]   Here's my question.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520]   That's 2003.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.520]   Wow.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.520]   What happened?
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.560]   It looks good then.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.360]   I would bet that the only people who ever look at the Facebook timeline are the people
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.360]   whose timeline it is.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.680]   Or if they're stalking you.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.280]   Or if they're like somehow evil and creepy.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.280]   But it's not normal.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.040]   I would never go to John's timeline and browse it.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.040]   Unless you were stalking me.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.680]   It seems highly unlikely.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.760]   Well, what if you met someone new, you know?
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.080]   And you were intrigued by this person.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.680]   That would be for one reason or another.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.680]   For one reason or another.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680]   If you're an employer.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680]   Yes.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.680]   That's the one's...
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   Stalker?
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.680]   Stalker.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.680]   I don't know.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:53.680]   Stalker.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.400]   Future loved one, but it's very intimate.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.400]   Future loved one.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400]   It is.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.400]   Future.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   I'm not a stalker.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   I'm a future loved one.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   Yeah, how would you like that?
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   That's not creepy at all.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.800]   And then they have a shrine in their closet with your pictures all over it.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.840]   Or just a spare net book with your timeline.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.040]   Is this so different from what we do in the way?
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.280]   This is the modern shrine.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280]   She nailed it.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.280]   It's a shrine of me.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.280]   She's just getting some candles, man.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.200]   But look, we just finished our baby book.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.520]   My son is 19 years old.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.080]   My wife, or 17 years old, finally finished his baby book.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.080]   Because that's how long.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.000]   I mean, it's like, finally gets around to who's going to look at that.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   Nobody's ever going to look at that.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   Your wife?
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   That's right.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   You?
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   It's a very limited narrow audience.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   Sister.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   No, she is.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   Stalker is an employer.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   And stalkers.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   Employers.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   And the employer is part.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.040]   That's one where you get back to teens and consequences and you have to really carefully trim
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.840]   down what's in your timeline.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.240]   Well, what's kind of weird about this is...
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:52.080]   I've put so much stuff now in my Facebook timeline that they're actually abridging it.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.080]   They're cutting stuff out.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.080]   I like saying...
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.080]   What does that tell you, Leo?
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.840]   If you want to see more, click here because frankly there's way too much crap in this.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.000]   So I don't know.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   But I love this.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.480]   I used to be a radio host.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.520]   Yeah, then I got shot in a knee with an arrow.
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.520]   The thing I love...
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.520]   Okay, so here...
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.160]   We don't want to see that picture.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.520]   What kind of a picture is this?
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.240]   This is not a good picture.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.120]   This is not flattering.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.520]   No, but look, this is like a butcher or something.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.520]   You're going to just...
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.520]   You're choking someone.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.720]   It looks like Sweeney Todd a little bit.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.720]   It does.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.040]   And somebody put in here, turned this into an Angry Birds.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.320]   This is why I went to that.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.320]   Your head?
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.320]   Is the Angry Bird?
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.320]   It's the beginning.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.320]   Oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.320]   The starting point for an Angry Bird.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.320]   You ready?
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.600]   This is from Mark Jefferson.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.000]   He calls it Angry Leo's.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   Oh, I like it.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   It's great.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   We're going to take a break.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.600]   I'm going to do the eyebrows.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.600]   There it is.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.600]   Okay.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   Come back.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.760]   I love Facebook.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.920]   Don't you all love Facebook?
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:04.160]   Who's given you stock now?
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160]   He's trying.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160]   It's too late.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160]   Too late.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   No, I don't take...
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.160]   He doesn't take stock.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.880]   I took stock from one guy.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:12.880]   Pals.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.880]   It made me rich and I don't know what to do.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.080]   I just slipped and fell off a truck.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.480]   And anyway, thank you, Wilford, for making me a wealthy.
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.160]   I used to ignore text talks, but then I took an arrow to the knee.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:34.640]   Hey, let's take you to Audible.com, which is one of my favorite places to get some reading
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   done.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.320]   Audible is a bookstore of audiobooks.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.120]   It's the best ever.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.680]   You go to Audible.com/twit2 right now.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.440]   You can sign up for two books.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:49.880]   Hey, John, when you go into my office, there's something on my bookshelves you might want
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:53.840]   that's actually somebody sent it for you.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.800]   This is like an eye spy with my little eye.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   Just look around and see if there's something that would just jump out at you as obviously
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.920]   intended for John C. de Vorek.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.320]   We'll see if he sees it.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.880]   Clorox Andy wipes.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.840]   Not the Clorox Andy wipes.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.560]   He's in a MacBook Air.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:17.680]   It's a copy of OS X, not OS X, but OS X, OS X, OS X, which John was a big OS II fan.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.840]   So let's see if John finds it.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.840]   Can we see a camera to see if he's looking in there?
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.840]   It's kind of dark in there, but I'm wondering if he's looking around.
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.120]   Nope, nope, nope.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.120]   Keep looking.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   Keep looking.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:35.600]   It's something you loved way back when, John.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.360]   Way back when he's looking around.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   He's searching.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.960]   Right beyond the bookshelf there, John.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.360]   Meanwhile, back to Audible.com.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.000]   So a hundred thousand books now, audiobooks.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.400]   And I tell you, and you've heard me talk about this.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.280]   I just started listening to the new Stephen King, 112263.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.680]   I love time travel stories.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.960]   This is a great one.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.600]   This is a great one.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:04.040]   No, not the Scotch, although if you want to bring that out, you could keep looking, John.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.280]   Do you think you'll find OS II warp?
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:10.440]   The sealed box just for him.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.440]   That's all right.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.440]   Go back to Audible.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.440]   That's fine.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.560]   Audible.com/twit2 will sign you up.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.560]   Go ahead.
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.560]   Help him find it.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.920]   Is there anybody around that can help him find it?
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:23.920]   I think it's on the bookshelf there.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:30.080]   OS II warp in a sealed box.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.080]   Audible is going to...
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.080]   Look at John.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:42.160]   No, that's not it.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.320]   There's a lot of stuff in there.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.720]   It's kind of jammed with stuff.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.320]   On the bookshelf, John.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.560]   No.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.480]   Are those yellow clogs?
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.480]   Those are yellow clogs.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.480]   Very good.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.560]   And is that a Linus penguin?
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.560]   Linus penguin.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   It is.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560]   It's a Linux.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.560]   It's tux.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.560]   In fact, there's two tuxes.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.560]   There's two tuxes.
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.560]   It's clock.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.560]   That's all right.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.680]   I'll find it for you in a second, John.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.680]   Where was I?
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.480]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.880]   You can sign up there for two books.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.880]   That's the platinum account.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.960]   Two books a month.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.880]   First month's free.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.880]   And you get two books.
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:23.200]   And they're yours to keep forever canceling any time paying nothing, if you like.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.280]   Adam Laskinski's new book just came out.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.520]   Actually, this is my next read.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.600]   I can't wait to read this inside Apple.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.600]   That's a good choice.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.200]   Not the one I was thinking of.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.200]   I will go get it for you, and I'll say it.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:38.840]   Inside Apple, how America's most admired and secretive company really works, this one
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.040]   is everybody's been waiting for this one.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.280]   Just came out a couple of days ago.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.440]   And the nice thing about Audible now is they're getting the audio the same day as the book
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.440]   comes out.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:53.440]   And I'll tell you, I'm thrilled because this is, I don't have time to read books.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.240]   I fall asleep, but I have an hour in the gym every day.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.200]   I have time driving in the car.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.440]   I have time cleaning house.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.440]   And that's when I get reading done.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.040]   Sometimes a couple hours a day of reading, and I just love that.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:09.760]   audible.com/twit2 plays on your iPod, your iPhone, your Zoom, your Kindle, if you've
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:13.040]   got audio on the Kindle.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:18.640]   Many GPS devices, it's just fantastic.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:22.880]   audible.com/twit22, two books for free.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   Give it a try today.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.520]   And we thank Audible so much for the support of this week in tech.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.520]   You never found it.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.400]   If it wasn't for you, Audible would not be the company it is today.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.000]   Oh, you just say things like that to make me feel bad.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.720]   Because then I feel like, "Gosh, why aren't I making more money or something?"
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.720]   You're making tons of money.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.960]   Amazon bought them.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   Amazon bought them.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.960]   And I think they've done very well since then.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.840]   You know, they didn't get any stock from them though, unfortunately.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.480]   So a couple of interesting stories out of, "No, I can't.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.240]   I don't and I won't because I don't."
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.240]   It's a conflict of interest.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.120]   A couple of interesting stories out of Twitter.
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:23:01.200]   First of all, they released information about DMCA takedown notices, 4,410 in 2011.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.360]   Yeah, what's the name of that website they pointed every-
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360]   Chilling Effects.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.840]   Yeah, there's something about this kind of thing.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.080]   They actually pointed people to Chilling Effects, which is I think kind of interesting.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:16.560]   Chilling Effects is an electronic frontier foundation website that basically the premise
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.640]   of it is, what are the chilling effects of these laws?
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:21.920]   What's the impact of these laws?
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.760]   Sure, the DMCA allows companies like Twitter and YouTube to have safe harbor.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:31.800]   In other words, not to be held liable for pirated content or whatever that's on their
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:37.800]   services provided they offer a mechanism so that the companies that own the rights can
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.640]   say, "Hey, get that off of there."
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.000]   And Twitter does it, YouTube does it.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.080]   Even mega upload did it, although it didn't protect mega upload.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:54.320]   And so here are all the cease and desist notices for 2011 up here from Magnolia Pictures, from
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.000]   Simon and Schuster.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   What are they links to?
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.600]   They're links to pirated content, I guess.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.600]   No, not always.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:05.360]   It could be a link to somebody else pointing to pirated content.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.360]   That's right.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.360]   That one kid was busted for that.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.360]   That's right.
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.360]   You're not even allowed to link.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.360]   Get into a link.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.360]   Get into a link.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.360]   Get into a link.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   Some kid in England, link to a link.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.200]   Some to be extradited, the guys never been to the United States.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.920]   It's a disgusting story and the Brits do nothing about it.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.920]   Right, Will?
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.280]   What have you done to help this poor kid?
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.920]   I blame Will.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.760]   What have we ever done to do anything?
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.040]   Well, how about ACTA?
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.880]   Has ACTA been approved now in Great Britain?
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.400]   Because I know it's about to be approved worldwide.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:38.640]   So it's a, well, it's now even running, right?
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.640]   Right.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:43.000]   25 of the 27 EU countries have now approved it.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.480]   But I think the EU has to approve it as, I mean, like the, what do you call it, the Congress
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.960]   has to approve it?
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   The Parliament.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.960]   The European Parliament.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:52.960]   There's like three different divisions.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.560]   There's a whole bunch of these.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:01.000]   So ACTA is the very sneaky SOPA that is done as a treaty instead of as a law.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.360]   And in fact, to get ready for this, it probably will be made the law of the land in the US
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.120]   not by Congress, not by the Senate, which normally approves treaties, but by executive
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.120]   order.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.480]   Yeah, it works.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.400]   So we have a king run in the country.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.920]   So you might as well just make executive orders all day and all night.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.520]   The Parliament says, yes, we can.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.080]   Well, Ron Wyden's fighting this.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.640]   Ron Wyden's really upset about the fact that ACTA and other true treaties are not approved
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640]   by the Senate.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.200]   So ACTA is an international trade agreement negotiated by the European Union, the United
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:41.240]   States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Australia, Mexico, Morocco, Singapore, Canada's involved.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.360]   It essentially gives you the three strikes act.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:53.400]   It gives you a lack of due process and shutting down so-called pirate sites.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:57.200]   It is really is the backdoor SOPA.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.120]   And I like the three strikes thing.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.440]   Let's start taking people's internet access away.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.440]   Just because we don't like them.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:08.760]   Well, that's been part of bills like this for, you know, since the internet became a place
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.040]   where you would trade pirated content.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.760]   So if you're interested, I urge you to go to EFF.org and read up on ACTA and why you
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.760]   should care about it.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:24.240]   ACTA has several features that raise concerns for privacy, for civil liberties, for the free
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.640]   flow of information on the internet.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   I've said it before.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.640]   I'll say it again.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.800]   We're finishing up on the golden age of the internet.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.240]   I think you might be right.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:35.640]   And we might as well enjoy it while we can because in the future, and the public doesn't
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:42.400]   care because as long as they can get the Facebook and Amazon, they're good to go.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:47.800]   The only thing you can do at this point is to petition the White House not to make it
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.880]   in executive order and tell members of Congress, actually not even members of Congress because
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.160]   it's the Senate now that would be responsible.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:59.200]   Tell your senators to demand the right to review ACTA and then not to approve it.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.200]   Good luck.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.200]   Good luck.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.640]   I mean, given that Obama came out and said that if SOPA got part, it wouldn't sign.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.640]   He also said he wouldn't sign.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   He should be content and then say it.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.640]   Yes, he can.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.440]   He said he wouldn't sign the National Defense Authorization Act, which should provide for
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.680]   militarization of the US in total.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.120]   Yeah, and indefinite incarceration for everybody.
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.120]   Right.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.120]   No habeas corpus.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.360]   Just pick somebody up, throw them in jail.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.460]   Repealed habeas corpus.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.760]   So here's what's going to happen, John.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:25.760]   Or this is my thought.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:26.760]   And I'd love to hear what your thoughts are.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.760]   Wow.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   All of you.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.440]   I've got this Microsoft thing here with all these URLs that they've got the cease and
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.440]   desist on is unbelievable.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.440]   Oh, these.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.440]   It goes for days.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.440]   It goes down to China.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.200]   So here to me is what I think will happen.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.400]   I don't think the internet will go away.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.400]   I agree.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.440]   We've had a golden age of free.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.440]   It's not going anywhere.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.440]   It's just going to be different.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:57.360]   I think there will be this kind of now bowled, lorized, protected internet that most people
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:58.360]   will use.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.840]   But I believe the internet is self-healing and geeks want free flow of information.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.800]   I think what's going to happen is you're going to get a second tier.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.560]   You're going to have a black internet.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.440]   You're going to have a just as you have a black market.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:13.160]   You're going to have an internet that you if you were just well, this is what happened
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.160]   in China.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.400]   In China, there's the internet everybody uses that doesn't allow Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:25.240]   But if you're in the literati, if you're digitally literate, you can get on all of those.
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.240]   You know how to get on all of those.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.840]   And I suspect that that's what's going to happen.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:28.840]   What do you think?
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.720]   We're going to have a subclass of pseudo hackers.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.280]   The matrix are used net or something.
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.640]   Well, it's a little scary.
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.400]   And it should be more frankly, if these rights holders thought about it, this is exactly what
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.160]   they don't want.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.040]   Because right now they have some tools.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.440]   They have the DMCA.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.440]   It is in public.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.960]   But as soon as it's a dark that anything goes.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960]   That's a fascinating idea.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.880]   I never thought of that kind of dystopian.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.720]   Well, there are a lot of hackers of this mentality.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.360]   I'm one of them.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.840]   Yeah, well, you're kind of one of them.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:57.840]   Well, you are one of them.
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.520]   Just take a look at that rig you've got over there.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.840]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.280]   That's a analog, baby.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.240]   But already hackers, and we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, are putting satellites
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.960]   up so they have satellite access.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.400]   Will do you think this is crazy?
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:10.600]   I don't think it's crazy.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:15.160]   I wonder if it's a forced evolution.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:16.600]   What doesn't kill you, make you stronger?
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.280]   And I wonder if it will lead to, you know, there are so many structural flaws with the
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:21.280]   internet.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.600]   I wonder if a sort of rebuilding from the ground up of something that's better will
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:31.920]   lead to, you know, you build something that's got security built in and, you know, anonymization
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.080]   and if you were going to design the internet from scratch again now, you could probably
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.080]   do a better job of it.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.480]   And so I wonder if this will be the catalyst for sort of a next generation of evolution.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.760]   Well, you're blowing my mind now, well.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:46.040]   I'm pretty sure that, you know, with internet too and some of this other stuff, we're definitely
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:49.720]   going to always have a couple of alternatives to the internet.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:52.600]   So why wouldn't we just do something like that?
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.400]   You know, or just let the other one split into pieces.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.960]   I still think what's going to, I think the real scenario here is first of all, we go
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.440]   into a nationalization of the internet country by country.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:07.440]   That way you don't have any problems within Saudi Arabia about anything because there's
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.360]   essentially a closed system.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.000]   We have one here and the thing that's going to kind of diminish everything, even though
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.440]   you have people like yourself and Leo and others, is the fact that the public at large
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.240]   doesn't care.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.040]   They will have their three or four things.
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:27.600]   Nobody goes, it's like people that when you remember when PCs first came out, you had
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.880]   some studies and it turned out that people only downloaded or installed three or four
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.040]   extra programs besides the one that they got on their PCs.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.360]   They don't do all this stuff.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:40.200]   There's very few people that, and in fact, I think the numbers getting smaller that are
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.960]   involved in anything more than just the basics.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   We were just stolen for Leo.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.360]   Well, you know, my concern is you don't do this.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.360]   You're right not to find it.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.360]   I know where it went.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.280]   It was OS2 warp in a sealed package.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.280]   Ooh.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280]   Which I know you would love.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.280]   Somebody sent it to us and I don't know where it's going.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.280]   The Smithsonian.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.280]   Believe it does.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280]   I think it was Jerry.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:03.560]   It was the IBM operating system that John was a big advocate for.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.960]   And somebody sent it to me, sealed in the box and it's disappeared.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.280]   So I think one of my staff members actually thought it was something you might want.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.280]   Or junk.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.600]   Or they threw it away.
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.600]   What's this?
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.440]   Anyway, no, I think this is a great conversation.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.640]   I think this is what's going to happen.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:20.040]   Well, Leo, if that does happen, I mean, what you and Will are talking about is like,
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:24.560]   okay, we're going to have a separate non-internet internet like thing that will allow digitally
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.200]   literate people to access information freely.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.360]   And it's going to be better because all those Facebook and your goes will be gone.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.080]   But that's not what the internet is not for the digitally literate.
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.080]   It's for everybody.
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.720]   I mean, did you read Vince Serf's op-ed in the New York Times?
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:38.720]   It's not a civil right.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:39.720]   It's not a human right.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.440]   But it gives you access to those things.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.440]   I agree.
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.440]   I agree 100%.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.440]   And when you limit that access.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.440]   I'm not advocating this.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.440]   Just a geek.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.280]   I'm not advocating this is why you have to fight SOPA.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.280]   Why you have to fight SOPA.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.280]   Well, we fought SOPA.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:53.400]   Do you think we can get people to fight after after fighting SOPA?
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:54.400]   It's hard to get people interested.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.400]   It's hard.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.400]   They only fight one or two.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.080]   So I believe don't get me wrong.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:01.160]   I'm not saying this is what should happen, but I think it's what's going to happen.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.400]   So who do we need to call?
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:05.760]   Do we need to call the White House or do we need to call our senators or both about
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.760]   ACTA?
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:10.440]   You can go to WhiteHouse.gov and there are petitions on WhiteHouse.gov.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.440]   Are there?
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:17.440]   You know, in the petitions section, one of the petitions is President Obama, do not
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.640]   sign ACTA.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.920]   Let the Senate have something to do with it.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.920]   Let me see if I can find it because that's...
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.600]   Also, the thing you...
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.720]   If you're in Europe, the thing you can do is write to your European member of parliament.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:33.400]   Yes, because they have to approve it and you can get back to approve it.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.040]   So even though most of the countries in the EU, apart from Germany and a couple of others,
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:40.800]   have approved it at a national level, it still has to be approved at the European level by
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:41.800]   the European Parliament.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.880]   So if you write to your European member of parliament and tell them to don't be so idiotic,
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:50.000]   you know, there's still a chance that's going to happen in June.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.200]   So, writing campaign between now and June if you're in Europe.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.000]   You know, it may not be on the White House site.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.440]   I guess it's not on the White House.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.400]   WhiteHouse.gov/petitions, I think, about the government.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.400]   See if it's there.
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.400]   Let's see.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.480]   We could put it up there if not.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:10.480]   The main idea is to get the president to say, "I am not going to pass this by executive
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.480]   order."
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.480]   What would be his rationale?
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.200]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:17.640]   His rationale is maybe to get elected because we do have an election coming up in November.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.640]   It's true.
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:23.320]   If this is how Sopa and Pippa worked, if we scared members of Congress into thinking they
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:27.720]   were going to lose their constituency, it's the only choice you've got at this point is
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.160]   to really make this an urgent thing.
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.160]   And the reason-
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.360]   So would you not vote for Obama if he-
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.920]   Because you're an Obama guy.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920]   I am.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920]   Would you not vote for Obama if-
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.920]   Absolutely not.
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:38.920]   You'd vote for him.
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:39.920]   No, absolutely not.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:40.920]   The problem-
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:41.920]   Who would you do?
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:42.920]   Stay home.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.920]   Would you vote for the Republican?
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.920]   I could vote for Newt Gingrich.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.920]   Well, he's not going to get in.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.920]   That's just-
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.920]   Oh, sure he is.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.920]   But some money on the table.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:49.920]   Is it Romney?
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:50.920]   Yeah, if not going to vote for him-
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.400]   Republicans are never going to vote for him.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.080]   I'll vote for Ron Paul as a write-in.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:55.920]   Well, that's a good idea.
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:01.760]   And that's why Obama's going to win, sorry, because everybody who would want Ron Paul
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.160]   to be on the Republican ticket, they're not going to say that.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.160]   No, I agree.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.240]   And Newt Gingrich is going to be up there being all new-
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:08.240]   That's what I'm going to say.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.800]   No, we've got to put some money on this.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.800]   Actually, I'd vote for Newt Gingrich as it is-
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:13.800]   I would vote for your jobs.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:14.800]   But we're getting way out of our-
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.800]   Okay, let's get back on the topic.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.800]   No, but here's the competition.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:21.680]   What's happening is that all the money coming out of Hollywood is influencing everybody right
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.680]   up into the White House.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.560]   But here's the thing, here's the thing, Leo.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:27.840]   If you would like Newt Gingrich, he can build a new internet on the moon.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.840]   That would be good.
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.640]   All right, maybe I'll vote for him.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.720]   Let's go to back to the story.
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.320]   And by the way, somebody said they're absolutely right because I live in California.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.040]   It doesn't matter who I vote for.
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.040]   True.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.880]   And actually, if you live in California, it doesn't matter if you call your senators,
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:46.600]   really, because it's so funny that we have all the entertainment here and all the-
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.280]   A lot of the technology talent here.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:55.600]   And last I checked, our two senators do not plan on not supporting legislation that helps
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.240]   the entertainment industry by censoring private citizens.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.160]   Because, yeah, right, because Feinstein and Boxer are getting a lot of money.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:03.880]   They're in the pocket from Hollywood.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:04.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:05.880]   Here it is.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.880]   It is on the White House.gov site.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:12.200]   We, the people, please submit active to the Senate for ratification as required by the
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.360]   Constitution.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.200]   It is a trade agreement.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.480]   Now that's the, that's step one.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:21.360]   And by the way, there are 4,549 signatures on there.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.840]   It's easy to create an account and sign it.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:26.120]   That's how many needed to reach a goal.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.120]   No goal.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.120]   But the goal is meaningless.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.440]   What you got to do is everybody has to sign this.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:31.440]   Raise this issue.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.360]   Ron Wyden in the Senate has been fighting for this.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.680]   The Senate wants the right to see this.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.200]   The thing about Actase has been in secret the whole time.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:47.560]   If it weren't for Michael Geist in Canada who finally found the, the, the treaty itself
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:50.200]   and published it, we would never know about this.
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.880]   This has been a secret.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:52.880]   This is one of them.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.880]   We do a lot of that.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:54.880]   We do a lot of that.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.880]   You bet.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:56.880]   And it's really shameful.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:02.680]   And Eric, Eric Duckeman in the chat room has got a list, has got a link to a petition
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.680]   that's an act, a petition on the White House.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.320]   That's got 35k signatures.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.040]   That's the one we were, that's what I think the one we were pointing to.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:14.880]   There's also some others on E petitions, but do the one on WhiteHouse.gov.
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:21.720]   And this, I think that the, the first step is to say you can't sign this as an executive
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.480]   order, Senate to the Senate.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.080]   Second, then the next step is to, you got to pressure the Senate.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.560]   Pressure the hell out of the Senate.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:28.560]   They're more likely.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.640]   No, unfortunately, not all of them are up for election.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.880]   Only half of them.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.080]   Thank you, Dan.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.720]   End Act and protect our right to privacy on the Internet.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.320]   I think this might be, there might be, so there's two of them.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.320]   They tried.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.320]   This is too bad.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.320]   No.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.320]   Oh, look at 35,000 on this one.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.320]   So this reached its goal.
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.520]   So there are several act, anti-active petition.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.720]   Let's sign them all.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.720]   Everybody will sign them.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.720]   We'll be signing them.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:53.720]   Sign them all.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.720]   All right.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.720]   Moving along, Twitter, do we want to talk more about, Twitter has decided that they are
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.160]   going to allow individual nations to censor tweets.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.040]   I wrote a column about this in PC Magazine.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.440]   I think they have to, don't they?
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.440]   I think they do too.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:09.440]   I don't think they have a choice.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.760]   I don't think they're, you know, I don't know if I don't know.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:16.720]   Well, if you have individuals in those countries work around that and the people who know how
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.960]   to, you can write code.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:21.600]   I mean, you don't have to write, you know, the Shahs and Idiot or whatever you'd put,
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.960]   I mean, a lot of these Middle Eastern countries, you can't say anything bad about their rulers.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.520]   And Guy with a beard.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.320]   I think he's dumb.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.320]   He's a dummy.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:33.280]   A dummy guy in the beard with the, with the thing on his head.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.920]   Don't like him.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.760]   See, and then they would all know.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:37.760]   Generally, yeah.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.760]   Generally speaking.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.720]   I think you have to do this because you're operating in a nation.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.960]   You have to abide by the rules of the nation as the same issue.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:48.840]   Google had in China, they had two choices, either adhere to the laws of China or withdraw.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.080]   So Twitter has the same thing.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.880]   There's also an interesting one for France.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:57.320]   So for example, in France, there are all sorts of like anti-Nazi propaganda laws.
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.320]   Right.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.320]   So, and you've got to, yeah.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.480]   So, you know, it's not just sort of the China's and the Saudi Arabia's.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480]   That's a good point.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.960]   You know, European countries are quite big on it.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.360]   That's actually a good point.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:12.000]   And I think it's just unfortunately or fortunately.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   It's just what you do.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.760]   But Twitter, I mean, who cares?
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:15.760]   It's Twitter.
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:16.760]   It's Twitter.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:17.760]   It's just like, hi, how you doing?
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:21.200]   I mean, there's just mundane.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.200]   I mean, who, you know.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.760]   Well, I mean, Twitter would argue if they were here, which they're not, that they have
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.480]   had some role in like political goings on whether there isn't free speech in the press
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.800]   and there isn't free speech, you know, on the radio in those countries that they take
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   over that role.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   Yeah, they claim that.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.800]   Yeah, they claim that.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.600]   But then they say, okay, we'll play along with local censorship.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:41.600]   So which one is it?
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:45.040]   Yeah, I think huge Facebook was huge in the Egyptian spring.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.040]   That's what they say.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.880]   Hey, there was a guy named his kid Facebook.
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:50.880]   Was that who is that?
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:51.880]   Is that a friend of yours?
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:52.880]   No, kind of agent.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:53.880]   Yeah, friend of mine Facebook Facebook.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.560]   Yeah, come here Facebook.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.880]   I think we're gonna rat this up.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:00.600]   I can even see that name in a dog Facebook.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:01.960]   I think in Arabic, it means.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:02.960]   Oh, that story.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.600]   Oh, that story just got bigger.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.680]   I got an email from the person you talk about it.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:12.840]   So why Combinator, which is a startup school, a very good one run by Paul Graham, one of
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:19.720]   their companies, one of their, you know, alumni companies, sure bit.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:25.680]   In fact, Dave McClure puts some money into them, apparently stole HTML code, images,
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.640]   and even linked back to 37 signals for their website.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:35.680]   Now 37 signals created, of course, by Jason Frieden, DHH, the guy who created Ruby on
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:36.680]   Rails.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.760]   So if you're gonna steal from somebody, go big, man.
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.760]   Go big.
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.920]   And Hanson's been tweeting like nasty ass tweets.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.920]   He's been pissed.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.520]   Everyone's been, everyone, I saw this.
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:51.200]   It was pointed out to me and I thought finally a puke storm on the internet.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.200]   It's my time to shine.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:54.400]   So I wrote this lovely post about it now.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:55.880]   Curebit says it was a mistake.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.880]   We were testing.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:57.880]   They didn't say it was a mistake.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.080]   They said, yeah, we stole it, but that's okay, right?
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.280]   We're so small.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:04.360]   It's okay because it was just an A/B test, which is BS.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.360]   So what is an A/B test?
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.520]   An A/B test is where I show you this phone and this phone and you decide which one you
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.520]   like better.
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:15.560]   And then we send 30,000 people and we send 15,000 to one phone and 15,000 to another
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.920]   and the one that responds best wins.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:21.080]   So if they had responded best to that design, then they would have gone with the stolen
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.080]   design.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.440]   Is Curebit in the same business as 37 signals?
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.440]   No.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.440]   No.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440]   But they just stole their design.
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.760]   They just stole their design and the images and they were--
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.120]   Yeah, they actually have links in the code to--
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.840]   Yeah, the images were coming off of the 37 signal server.
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:35.840]   Very simple servers.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.840]   Now it gets better.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:37.840]   Less kind of creepy stuff.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:43.040]   So the guy who founded one of the co-founders for Curebit was on Twitter talking some trash
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.600]   to DHH who is not known for his pleasant demeanor.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:48.960]   Here's the tweet.
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.280]   It'll all be okay.
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   Chill dude.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.560]   Yeah, you don't go up to this very irascible personality and say chill dude, where are
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.640]   you getting so freaked out about?
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.640]   Wow.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:04.520]   And last night someone sent me an anonymous email that Curebit hadn't only stolen the
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:05.520]   images in the code.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:10.640]   They had a demo video where they stole music from a local San Francisco artist, not like
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.560]   Metallica or somebody where they make millions of dollars.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560]   They don't care.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.160]   A local independent artist.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:22.000]   And then if you go to Twitter/randomrabb, randomrabb, you can see it all going down
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.840]   where this guy says, yeah, they did steal my music for their demo video.
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:32.640]   They didn't get in touch with me beforehand and I'm asking them to take it down and then
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:35.200]   they're trying to buy me out now.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.120]   But he said it's sad to be put in the position of telling someone why it's wrong.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.000]   You cannot convince the Curebit guys that what they have done is wrong.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.320]   They think stealing is okay.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.320]   And you know what?
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.520]   A lot of people think it's okay.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:50.920]   A lot of the lean startup people think that this is perfectly fine.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:51.920]   That's how you be lean.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:55.200]   No, you be lean by working harder than everybody else.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.480]   You're lean because we stole it all.
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:59.260]   And eating ramen because you're paying a designer.
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:00.260]   Jesus.
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:02.320]   I'm like freaking.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.920]   She's through with you.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.920]   She's angry.
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.240]   I've heard a good story though.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:09.320]   It is a great story, nicely done.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.320]   Thank you.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:11.320]   Jolio Del writes for VentureBeat.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.040]   You can read all her stories there.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.040]   VentureBeat.com.
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.000]   Look for her rock and roll singing on YouTube and what else?
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.760]   You want to plug your book?
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:18.760]   Oh, give me the book.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:19.760]   Give me the book.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:20.760]   Give me the book.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:21.760]   Give me the book.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.760]   Please go buy my book.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.760]   Where could I find this book?
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.760]   You can find it on Amazon.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.200]   You can find it in some retailers that I'm not allowed to mention yet.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.600]   It is on sale February 7th, but you can pre-order it now and it is so much fun and informative
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.600]   too.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:36.520]   And it's published by Ilex.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.560]   And I love the design of the formula.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.560]   It's a nice book.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.560]   It's a beautiful.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.160]   They spent some money on four color printing here.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:45.160]   And you know what?
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.600]   I spent so much time writing it.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.600]   I thought it was going to be some big, dry technical manual, but they made it beautiful.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:54.720]   So if you're interested in using your phone, it doesn't have to be Android.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.720]   It could be any camera phone, right?
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.920]   But if it has a lot of emphasis on Android apps.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.920]   But how to do it in Android?
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.320]   Because when you're going to spend money on an app, you want to know that it's a good
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.320]   one.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320]   Oh, so I--
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.320]   Sorry, I reviewed one.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320]   Oh, there's reviews of apps.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.320]   Oh, I spent so much money on apps to get those.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.320]   Oh, excellent.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:13.160]   And what camera phone did you like the best?
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:14.160]   I think the--
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.160]   Maybe the Evo.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:16.160]   Evo's pretty good.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:19.400]   I don't like the 3D thing and the new one, but that's silly.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.440]   I'm a big fan, actually, the Galaxy S2.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.920]   And your Nexus is pretty good.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:26.560]   I like this phone, and it's not that, but I keep it with my keys in my pocket, and there's
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:27.800]   not a scratch on it.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.800]   That's amazing.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.800]   How do they do that?
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:30.800]   Wow, really?
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.480]   Yes, because they use that corning gorilla glass, which feels like plastic.
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.480]   Right.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.240]   But it's actually some weird glass.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.800]   You keep your keys in your front pocket?
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.520]   No, I usually wouldn't know how to do my pocket.
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.520]   Oh, OK.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.520]   The keys are in there bouncing off.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:44.760]   And this phone's a year old bouncing against keys, not a scratch on it.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:48.240]   Jolie, where do you share your-- you don't have a cell phone, so you don't share your
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.240]   phone?
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:50.480]   I share my photography on Flickr.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.400]   Good.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.400]   That's all there.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.400]   Just some good stuff.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.400]   Thank you, Jolie.

[01:43:58.200 --> 01:43:59.200]   That's right.
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:00.200]   J-O-L-I-E.
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:05.240]   John C. Dvorak is at Channel Devorak, and No Agenda is every Sunday morning with the

[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.240]   And Thursday now, too.
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.240]   No, it's always been on Thursday.
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:11.080]   You do this every time.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.200]   You know, we asked Adam to come on with you, and he said, "I hate that son."
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:17.920]   I'm like, "No, you could get Adam on next week doing this Super Bowl, because he doesn't
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:18.920]   care about football."
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920]   He doesn't care about football.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.120]   And anything else to plug?
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.920]   Channel Devorak.com.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:25.920]   Devorak.org.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.280]   I think I'm at PC Magazine Market, watch.
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.640]   You can go there and read some of these more recent columns.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.280]   They're pretty interesting.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:34.680]   And also the X3 show.
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:35.680]   That's right.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.280]   And the Generation X3 show, which is the best show I think I've ever done.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:39.280]   That's two.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:40.840]   Yeah, I got three millennials.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:41.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:46.080]   And we talk about topics of the day, and it's just like the Baby Boomer versus the millennials.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.560]   It's the most fascinating show, especially when they talk about things like binge drinking
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.560]   and all these other possibilities.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:53.560]   I'm going to listen to that, because I want to know what the Generation X3.mivio.com.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:57.160]   No, kids don't know about binge drinking these days, I swear.
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:58.160]   These guys do.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.960]   Not like Jolie did and her and her and them.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:01.960]   Like old salts.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:02.960]   And her and them.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:03.960]   Oh man.
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:04.960]   You'd be surprised.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.960]   Generation X3.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.960]   Why?
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.960]   I don't have to listen.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:08.960]   This is on Mivio, if you want to find out.
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:09.960]   But you can just Google Generation X3.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.520]   Yeah, it's the most entertaining thing I've done for a while, because I'm flabbergasted
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:14.520]   half the time.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.520]   You're stunning.
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:16.520]   Wow.
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:17.520]   What?
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:21.720]   Justin Dorian Douglas and Eddie DeRosa with John.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:22.720]   Fun.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.160]   Will is still a channel flip.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.160]   He's not going anywhere.
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:28.000]   Channelflip.com or at Will Harris with one.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000]   I see he's not wearing his wealth yet.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000]   No, I'm just sorry.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.080]   He's dressed exactly like Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.320]   What are you talking about?
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.320]   That's the new wealth.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.120]   Are you wearing Adidas shower shoes?
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.760]   No, I do have Converse.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.320]   They wish you would have the same thing.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.840]   That's always great to hear.
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:45.840]   Slave labor.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.840]   Thank you for being here.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.160]   It's a pleasure at Will Harris on Twitter.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.720]   And congratulations on your success.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.520]   I think that's fantastic.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:55.480]   I'm very happy for you.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.480]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.880]   Let's see what's going on on the week ahead, Tom Merritt.
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:00.880]   Wow.
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:01.880]   He's here.
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:02.880]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:03.880]   I won't be around this week.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:07.320]   But here are a couple of things that Sarah and I as will be keeping an eye on on Tech News
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.320]   today.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.160]   Monday, January 30th, D dive into media kicks off with guests like Dick Costolo of Twitter,
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:18.080]   Jason Kilar of Hulu, singer Neil Young, and Martha Stewart along with several others.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.640]   Also on Monday, President Obama will be hanging out on Google+.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.040]   Tuesday, January 31st.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.040]   Yeah, right.
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:27.120]   The Canon EOS C300 is set for release in Japan.
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.760]   The crunchies will be awarded for categories like Best Location App, Best Cloud Services,
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.680]   Best Shopping App, and much more.
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.280]   And Google Wave goes read only just in case anybody's still reading it.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.520]   Wednesday, February 1st, dish will offer a 24-hour test drive for their tablet and smartphone
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:48.360]   streaming to anyone in the United States and connect for Windows becomes available for

[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.880]   Finally, Saturday, February 4th.
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.680]   Happy eighth birthday to Facebook.
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:56.680]   Wow.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.680]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:58.680]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:46:59.680]   Thank you, Tom.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:00.680]   Hey, wait.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:01.680]   You see here?
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:02.680]   Where did he go?
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:03.680]   I wanted to talk to him.
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:04.680]   You just missed him.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:05.680]   He just left for Hawaii.
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:06.680]   He's actually spending the week in Hawaii with his lovely wife, Eileen River.
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.680]   That was pre-recorded.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:08.680]   There he is.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:09.680]   He's gone.
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.680]   Oh, man.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:11.680]   That was fast.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.680]   He packed in his out of here.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.480]   You got a back door in this place?
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.480]   What's the deal?
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.480]   Boom.
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:18.480]   Boom.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.480]   He is out of here.
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:20.480]   That's interesting.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.480]   So it's Facebook's eighth birthday.
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:22.480]   That'll be an appropriate time to file for your eyes.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.480]   Yeah, I might as well.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.480]   Do it on your eighth birthday.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.480]   Eight years and billions.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.480]   Wow.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.480]   Why not?
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.120]   We are, of course, next week's a Super Bowl, so we will start early next week.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:35.480]   So if you like to watch live, normally the show's at 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.440]   on Twitter.tv.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.360]   Next week, we'll start shortly after the radio show.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.360]   It's about 2.15, probably.
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:46.480]   But tune in it to Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:49.280]   If you'd like to watch live, of course, you don't have to because we make audio and video
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:52.000]   recordings available almost immediately.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.960]   We're working on making that faster on iTunes and all the other places.
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.440]   Finder podcasts are found.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.800]   Game on is coming up just a little bit.
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.480]   Our brand new gaming show with Brian Rushwood and Veronica Belmont.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.480]   They are in the other room stripping down.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.480]   They were.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:07.480]   Back there, I saw that.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.480]   They're getting ready.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.840]   They've got costumes.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.520]   They've got characters.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.600]   They've got gaming.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:13.720]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:17.040]   You want to make sure you stay tuned for Game on.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:21.480]   Our brand new gaming show, Episode 3, is on in moments.
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:22.480]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:23.480]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:24.480]   We'll see you later.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.280]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.280]   This is amazing.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:35.920]   Do the twit.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.780]   Alright, I'm doing it to you.
