[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.400]   This week in tech, the show that covers technology news
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.280]   in obsessive detail.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.680]   And we've got to--
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.640]   I was just saying, it's like the village elders of
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.280]   technology here.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280]   A very manly panel starting.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.640]   Unfortunately, I wish you were in person with us, Jeff,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.200]   because we're drinking some fine Italian wine.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.480]   Jeff Jarvis, who could not be on this week in Google with us
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.880]   this week.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.240]   So we thought, well, let's get him on Twit.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.120]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.200]   I am so honored and delighted to be here.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.960]   I love Twig, but I also just--
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.760]   when I'm on the big time, I feel like a grown-up.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.680]   I've moved to the grown-up table.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.280]   Thanks, giving.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.120]   I'm very happy.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.960]   Jeff Vlogs@buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.360]   And this, of course, is a professor of journalism at the
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   City University of New York.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.200]   Worked for many years here in San Francisco at the--
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.320]   was the Chronicle an examiner?
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   The examiner, the examiner.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.160]   What's paper?
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.000]   And I'm sorry, but I have to do this.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.800]   And there's his new book.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.200]   Just came out, Public Parts.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.040]   September 27, September 27, coming out anytime.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.800]   And Twit readers, I want nothing more than you.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.640]   Now sharing-- what's the subtitle?
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.760]   How sharing in the digital age improves the way we work and
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.120]   live.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.240]   And we agonized for a long time over that on the Twig show.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.480]   And that is a good subtitle, because it says it all.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.280]   Can't wait to read it.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.080]   When I did the video promotion and I talked about my penis,
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.760]   they went to that by saying don't do that.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.240]   Don't do that.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.640]   Look at what it is.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.000]   Jeff, it's great to have you.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.280]   Thank you for being here.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.720]   To Jeff's right, somebody who has--
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.840]   I don't think you've ever been on Twit.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.200]   No.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's my first time.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.960]   But an old friend, Cedric Engron, he is the host of
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.280]   Planet Crenn, which is a very popular show about technology
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.160]   in France on TF1.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.000]   And--
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.440]   It's actually on LCI, which is the new stuff.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.720]   I'm sorry, LCLCI.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.920]   I mean, and when I see Jeff feeling all grown up, being on
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.320]   Twit, imagine how that makes me feel.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.200]   I'm just glad to have you.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.920]   You brought wine.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.040]   And I think that's a good start.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.560]   Italian wine.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.840]   I brought wine in a mini-tell.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.160]   And a mini-tell.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.240]   Well, there's a story.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.080]   There's a long story.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.480]   Great Italian wine that's actually owned by a U.S. CEO.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.840]   Look at this behind me.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.480]   I don't know if you can see this, but there's a mini-tell.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.120]   I want one.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.280]   That's a working mini-tell.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.240]   You're getting one, Jeff.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.400]   You're getting one.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   I couldn't bring two through Apple Security in Paris.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   Bringing one was fun enough.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.920]   I mean, the guy looking at the X-ray was going, what's that
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.040]   big thing in the middle?
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.680]   I said, that's a CRT.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.960]   You haven't seen too many of those recently.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.320]   And it's also actually pretty interesting, because
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.600]   me-tell services are just now shutting down.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.440]   Well, that's what happened.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.120]   We talked about that.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.720]   I haven't used one in maybe 12 years, but there's still
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.320]   people who have this at home and use it for directory
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.720]   assistance, getting train tickets and the like.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.040]   They have just shut down the weather service this very weekend.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.040]   Wow.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.360]   What are the hookers going to do?
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.440]   That, yes, you used it.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.840]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.640]   You could tell he immediately jumped in.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.320]   He's made that happen.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.400]   He was a boon for adult services and D80s and 90s.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.160]   Was it really?
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   It was just effective.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.840]   Well, the idea was that French telecom gave everybody in
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.880]   France a mini-tell terminal, so they didn't have to give you
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.600]   phone books anymore.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.400]   Absolutely.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.000]   And then this was in the age of prodigy and genie and
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.520]   composter.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.440]   Early days of computing.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.360]   And you paid by the minute.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.480]   It was a video tech service.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.400]   Oh, you paid for it.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.280]   Oh, you paid by the services by the minute.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.300]   All right.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.360]   Chet prices.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.960]   And usually it was actually newspapers that were actually
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   operating these adult services.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.600]   Because you needed to be a real media to operate services, be
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.200]   it direct-- not directory assistance.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.720]   So they--
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   And they kind of started meeting with--
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.960]   --even if they're running the hookers.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.920]   Absolutely possible.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.280]   They lose.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.720]   They lose.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.160]   France.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.640]   We have always been pimps in media.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.760]   You know, it's the same today with the Village Voice.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.000]   There's a lot of--
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.680]   Invective against the Village Voice because it's the same
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.840]   thing.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.400]   Hey, before we go on, I do want to introduce the rest of our
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.920]   panel, John C. de Vorak from, of course, channeldevorak.com.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.720]   And the great--
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.240]   No agenda show.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.760]   No agenda show.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.520]   Did you look at the bricks?
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.720]   There's a bunch of no agenda bricks.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.320]   No agenda show.com.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.560]   There's a no agenda show.com brick.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.440]   Several of them.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.880]   Oh, good.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.720]   There's a brick that says that the morning--
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.640]   It's like they thought I would get all upset if you did that.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.560]   And I, of course, no agenda.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.720]   He's a bad guy.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.640]   I believe he didn't get upset.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.680]   He put him all in the bathroom.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.600]   No, they're right on the floor.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.040]   I'll show you when we're done.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   Also-- and I'm really pleased to get Mike Elgin in here.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.920]   I've been following Mike for a long time, computer world,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.760]   of course, but his newsletter, which was kind of off and on
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.800]   and got very serious, has just been, for years,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.320]   a great resource for me on not only great tech stories,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.640]   but kind of the oddball stuff.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.960]   You've been just great at that.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.400]   And you have discovered and used Google Plus.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.760]   There's a handful of people who are really using Google Plus
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.360]   effectively--
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.320]   Trey Rakliff, Mike Elgin.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.160]   If you're not following Mike on Google Plus,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.880]   you're missing out.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.080]   So it's great to have you, Mike.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.200]   It's so nice to see you.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.840]   Glad to be here.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.880]   Thank you for finally making it to Twit.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.240]   And it's my fault, not yours.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.000]   I should have invited you long ago.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.040]   So a great panel to discuss a bunch of big stories.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.000]   Here's Mike's site.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.640]   A bunch of big stories in the news.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.600]   And I don't know where to start.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.680]   I think we'll get to the San Francisco police in a bit.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.440]   The scandal.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.040]   Come on, let's start with that.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.360]   It's a great story.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   Should we start with-- no, I want
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.520]   to start with T-Mobile and AT&T, because really, that
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   is the real tech story of the week.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.480]   The Department of Justice earlier this week
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.760]   announcing that they were going to sue
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.640]   to halt the $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile by AT&T.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.080]   Were you shocked, Jeff Jarvis, to hear this?
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.600]   I was surprised.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.560]   I think we've seen a lot of merger activity going on lately.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.240]   And why this one particularly gets stopped.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.720]   Yeah, there's less competition.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.720]   That's absolutely true.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.920]   But we take two sucky phone services and put them together.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.200]   Do we have one less sucky phone service?
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.160]   I don't know.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.800]   I am shocked, because I just didn't think the DOJ did any trust
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.160]   anymore.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.720]   There hasn't been much action since George Bush
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.480]   entered the White House.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.280]   And yet, I think if you're going to pick one,
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.880]   this is the one.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.440]   Mike, you agree?
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.480]   Well, first of all, I don't think the government's case
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.000]   is going to hold.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.440]   I think--
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.000]   Really?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Yeah, I think it'll end up being--
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.960]   I think this judge, Hovell, is going to just--
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.160]   it's going to go sailing through.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.240]   However, it kind of smacks of election year, election season
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.760]   politics.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.920]   You should think, you're out to give you
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.680]   Obama's just--
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.880]   Yeah, he's just trying to win election.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.480]   I'll get some money.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.000]   And come on.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.320]   You guys donate a little bit.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.120]   Oh, you mean he thinks that if he does this,
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.800]   he'll get some money out of AT&T?
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.800]   No, no, no.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.120]   I think that's what's happening.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.880]   What's happening is they went over the list
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.160]   of where they're vulnerable.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.920]   And they said, well, we haven't opposed anything.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.400]   Right.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.160]   We haven't stood up to our contributors.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.080]   AT&T is the biggest contributor to political organizations.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.040]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.840]   Well, that's just you're just confirming my belief.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.800]   Well, I mean, but they looked tough,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.600]   and they probably know they don't have a case anyway.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.120]   So--
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.920]   The US District Judge Ellen Hovell of DC
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.160]   is known for not necessarily going
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.360]   with the government in these antitrust cases.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.560]   Most recently, in 2001, she approved a merger
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.480]   between Comdisco and Sungard that the government had attempted
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.840]   to shut down, saying, in fact, there's
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.120]   no barrier to entry in the computer security business.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.760]   And that's a good reason, frankly, to say, no, let this go
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.280]   through.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.960]   There's a huge barrier to entry in cell phone companies.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.640]   We have four, but that's a week four.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.920]   If you have AT&T mobile merging, that's
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   the only GSM cell phone company in the States,
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.160]   that's a monopoly.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.040]   It makes Sprint incredibly weak compared to AT&T and Verizon,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.760]   probably a candidate for being gobbled up.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.120]   And then you have two.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.560]   And I think that we have enough problems
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.320]   with lack of competition in the cell industry, as is--
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.360]   I love seeing this.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.960]   And I hope that they block it.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.200]   Do you think who fella say yes to this?
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.040]   Let me say no to it.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.800]   So allow them to--
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.640]   I never said that.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.280]   I agree with Mike that it's going to somehow get through.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:18.800]   God, I think that's terrible.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   As far as I'm concerned.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.920]   And I've written about this in MarketWatch PC Magazine,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.560]   because I hate AT&T, because they're basically
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.960]   a crummy company that does not serve the public well.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.400]   But aren't they all crummy companies?
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.760]   These guys are particularly bad.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.640]   Yeah, they all are.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.320]   And so we don't need a consolidation anymore,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.600]   because once this happens, it's going
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.360]   to be further consolidated until eventually AT&T
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.720]   will own the whole place again.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.400]   They're back.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.560]   As a kind of with this name AT&T, which they reacquired,
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.320]   because it's not really AT&T, but it's kind of.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.920]   And they got the AT&T theory.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.000]   This should be stopped.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.200]   Well, you know who else wants to stop?
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.160]   You know who else wants to stop?
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.920]   This is T-Mobile.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.360]   Yes, they make a lot of money.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.320]   They make $3 billion.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.520]   $3 billion plus spectrum plus the--
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   Give them fee on this.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.160]   It's huge.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.160]   They get it.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.960]   Well, it's--
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.480]   In effect, it's six because of the value of the spectrum.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.000]   Right.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.720]   That's right.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.120]   It adds up to six or seven.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.000]   But yeah, three in cash.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.560]   They get big discounts on incoming calls to AT&T.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.800]   So they're praying that this will not--
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.600]   That's a question.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.960]   Well, AT&T agreed to a kill fee that big.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.760]   I mean, they must have thought this is a no-brainer.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.280]   This is a no-brainer.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.160]   It was a slam dunk.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.920]   Apparently.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.160]   But Leo, I think that one thing that we could get out of this
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.200]   is if Obama had the imagination,
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.440]   and if people had the imagination,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.640]   is to negotiate mobile net neutrality
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.240]   to make the deal go through and putting Verizon and the Google
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.760]   deal, the devil's deal, into a difficult position there,
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.320]   then.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.160]   But they won't do that.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.280]   But that's what I wish would happen,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.560]   is at least we'd get something out of this deal.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.800]   It's not unusual for this exact thing that scenario to occur.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.160]   The DOJ sues to a block.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.160]   And then everybody sits down at the table,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.000]   and it's like a plea bargain.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.440]   A deal is made.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.600]   The government gets something and what
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.120]   that it wants these companies get the merger.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.320]   I don't--
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.080]   What do you most want?
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.640]   I think that we need competition.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.960]   I think that--
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   I use T-Mobile on a Google phone.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.320]   Losing T-Mobile would, I think, be a tragedy for users,
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.680]   because already these companies are repacious.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.640]   They act like monopolies with their early termination fees.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.280]   Verizon starts it by giving you 20 seconds of crap
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.440]   to leave a message.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.520]   Press 1 if you want to leave a fax.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.560]   A what?
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.720]   And they go on and on.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.040]   And this is a blatant attempt to rack up the minutes.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.440]   Verizon does it, and everybody goes, hey, that's a good idea.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.520]   So AT&T T-Mobile and Sprint do it.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.800]   These companies are monopolies.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.760]   They collude on prices.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   If it weren't for the fact that T-Mobile and Sprint are also
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.960]   rans, I don't think we'd see competitive pricing from them.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.240]   Thank god we do.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.640]   AT&T--
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.560]   I don't want to lose--
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.280]   How do you really feel, Leah?
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.800]   I don't want to lose Carly.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.440]   I don't want to lose Carly, the beautiful woman
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.920]   in the T-Mobile ads.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.520]   Doesn't she look just like--
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.040]   what's her name?
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.080]   You know, Michael Douglas is why.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.160]   Katherine Zeta-Jones.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.120]   She's a duplicate.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.280]   No, she's a young Katherine Zeta-Jones.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.080]   I have to say--
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.920]   --that's a nice leg, Zeta.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.040]   The whole country in your country seems
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.480]   to be in a pretty sorry state when you're a consumer.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.120]   So in France, you have orange.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.240]   We have orange and then free.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.200]   And they're actually free, which is a DSLR.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.720]   How many companies are there?
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.280]   Oh, I would say a dozen and four major.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.360]   That's what we need.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.240]   And I mean four major meaning, if we were in France right now,
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.200]   you'd get a choice of getting DSL
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.080]   from these dozen providers, because they can each use each
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.240]   other's networks.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.120]   And it works to say--
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.800]   I mean, I come from the beautiful land of $50.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.720]   All you can eat triple play with included phone service
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   for free and blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.120]   And fiber cost pretty much the same.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.400]   But in the wire-- so it sounds like there's
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.480]   a little confusion among wireless companies and phone
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.840]   companies and internet service providers.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.280]   They're all the same players.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.760]   Pretty much, yeah.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.680]   Even free was just a DSL provider,
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.160]   is now going to be a mobile operator.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.600]   And apparently wants to come out with--
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.040]   Who owns the spectrum in France?
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.120]   How does that work?
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.360]   Do they share a spectrum?
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.080]   Same as here.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.040]   I mean, the spectrum is always a national treasure
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.480]   that you--
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.640]   That is least to the--
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.680]   Yeah, sort of.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.080]   But they're not sharing spectrum.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.040]   They're all in their--
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.920]   I mean, how does that work?
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.400]   Good question.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.160]   They're all GSM.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.720]   There's no CDMA in France.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.560]   That's one advantage you have.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.960]   The chatter will correct me, but I
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.360]   don't think there's even CDMA anywhere in Europe.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:30.840]   Maybe--
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.000]   No, it's Canada.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.880]   It's all GSM.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.960]   Korea's all CDMA.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.040]   So everyone works on the same standards
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.560]   with the same phones, which is real important.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.880]   I mean, the whole debate about--
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.360]   That gives you an option.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.000]   --that there's no CDMA iPhone, blah, blah, blah,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.840]   is that something that's--
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.960]   Phones are by law unlocked, right?
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.560]   No, no, no, they are locked when you buy them,
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.840]   because you do get--
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.400]   I mean, the company sponsors the price of the phone
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.320]   when you buy it.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.200]   But they unlock it too.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.040]   Buy a law.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.360]   They have to unlock it if you ask within six months.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.960]   They have to unlock--
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.480]   Six months.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:13:59.480]   --six months.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.320]   They have to offer it, right?
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:00.840]   I mean, is that--
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.880]   They don't have to offer it, but if you call them,
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   they'll just give you a code.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   I see.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.600]   And you can migrate your phone number
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.840]   to another company in less than a week.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.640]   They unlock phones here.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.520]   Who unlocks phones here?
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.360]   All of them.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   I've had AT&T unlock a phone for me.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.240]   What, you could call them up and say unlock this phone?
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.840]   Yeah, once you pass your two-year contract.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.680]   Really?
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.520]   And they give you this long code, and they say, look,
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.760]   if you screw it up, you're going to get to screw it up.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.920]   Three times, the phone is bricked.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.120]   So you have to be really careful.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.320]   It makes you freaked out.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:28.960]   That's interesting.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.440]   I didn't know that you could do that.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.640]   I've taken it to independent cell phones.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.680]   Cell phones, you may have cell phone.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.080]   They can give it enough.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.360]   And they have a little box, and they'll do it.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.480]   But oh, that's interesting.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.440]   So if you beg them--
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.360]   You just have to ask.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.280]   Nobody asks.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.120]   Huh.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.720]   Fascinating.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.520]   So anything else to say about this?
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.000]   I just-- I think this is the right--
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.040]   I think the government finally did the right thing.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.680]   I hope that this is a cynical move on their part
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.640]   to win votes or perhaps make a deal.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.960]   I hope they hold their own and Judge Hovell
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.920]   sees the merit of this.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.880]   I can't think of a better example of monopoly
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.280]   than these wireless carriers.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.720]   In fact, I wish Congress would grow some kahone
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.960]   and start doing something.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.840]   They keep making noise about doing something about ETFs.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.320]   They do nothing.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.280]   And these companies are among the worst.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.800]   Aren't they?
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.320]   Am I wrong?
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.720]   I think we conclude that everybody
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.240]   at eight, they're wireless companies.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   Who likes the ATE?
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.280]   Who likes the ATE?
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.160]   The worse is the chat room hates them, too.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:23.640]   So you're--
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.480]   The biggest problem--
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.400]   Yeah, the biggest problem, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.480]   is the fact that there's no solid ground in terms of pricing.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.560]   You go there and they say, well, we subsidize your phone
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.440]   and you get two-year service.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.480]   What's the value of two years of wireless service?
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:35.840]   Right.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.920]   Nobody has any items.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.680]   Thousands.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.000]   So you go-- you get a $500 phone for $200 subsidized.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.720]   And they end up charging you $1,000 for it
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.520]   because the rest of it is all buried inside that contract.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.000]   And this is why everything is going towards the subsidized
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.760]   model because with uncertainty about pricing,
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.680]   they can charge anything they want.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.400]   And they all do it.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.280]   And there's really nobody's doing anything about it.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.560]   There's no transparency.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.400]   It's a big problem.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.760]   I'd like the government to answer your question, Jeff.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.720]   Do both with internet service providers,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.360]   or if the phone company and the cable companies,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.520]   and with these wireless providers,
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.760]   the same thing, which is foster competition
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.640]   by forcing these companies to allow other companies
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.520]   to use their networks, provide affordable ways for MV&Os
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.880]   to use their networks to create--
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.720]   The British model.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah, to create virtual competition.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.600]   The cable companies right now are not
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   required to allow other companies to ride on their infrastructure.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.040]   The phone companies are--
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.880]   I think we should make cable companies do that.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.640]   We need more internet service providers.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.560]   We need more wireless care companies.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.920]   That's how you get competition.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.000]   That's how you get prices down.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.080]   That's, in effect, how you create net neutrality,
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.400]   not by regulation, but by competition, don't you think?
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.160]   Well, isn't that the white space's argument?
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.800]   That's the argument that Google's made,
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.200]   is that it's by taking the white space spectrum
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.760]   and making it Wi-Fi on steroids that we would get competition
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.240]   that way.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.320]   And that's what I wish we would have, but we don't.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.160]   And you know, when Obama's going to give his job speech
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.520]   this week, I've been thinking about this.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.920]   I really want instead of a works progress administration,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.840]   kind of a works broadband administration.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.720]   We ought to be thinking of that as the growth of the country.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.480]   I'm going to get a little political just briefly.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.760]   So people who hate politics--
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.440]   Stand back.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.800]   I will hear about this every single time because they say,
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.720]   no, talk, tack.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.800]   You shouldn't talk politics.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.080]   But I want it-- because when John's here,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.440]   I like to talk politics with John,
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.680]   because we're such a natural ad for series.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.600]   That's not true at all.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.440]   We're actually on lockstep agreement with 99% of the--
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.920]   That's probably true, actually.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.040]   A friend of mine said Obama's out, easily out.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.840]   It's Rick Perry in--
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.880]   Well, I'm asking you in 2012, you picked--
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.760]   I think you did pretty well in the last election,
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.840]   picking the horse race.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.480]   Well, you wanted my quick take?
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.800]   You knew McCain would run.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.480]   And I also picked Sarah Palin way before anyone could venture.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.080]   So I'm curious what your take is on 2012.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.400]   And here's why it's Jermaine.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.240]   I think you're right.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.960]   I think this is politics, this is this T-Mobile lawsuit.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.480]   And I think we're going to see more of this.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.600]   And I think it does affect us.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.760]   And I don't think we're seeing much impressive movement
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.160]   from the government on net neutrality, on deregulation,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.000]   regulation, rather, of the wireless industry.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.440]   So what do you think, John?
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.400]   I think both parties are trying to lose the election.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.600]   They're doing their best.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.280]   No, seriously.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.360]   Why not, kid?
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.920]   The Republicans want to run Rick Perry who can't win.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.640]   And the Democrats keep saying, no, no, no, run Romney.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.600]   Run Romney, who can possibly win.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.400]   He could win, but the Republicans won't give him a nod.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.160]   They don't like-- they want to run somebody to lose,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.200]   because everybody knows.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.400]   And you can check this out as I go along and finally get
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   my book out on the Depression cycles.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.240]   2013 is going to be a huge collapse of the economy.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.720]   And everybody in both parties knows it.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.800]   And that's for years.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   Yeah, 2013.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.520]   But the incumbent always loses if the economy tanks.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.520]   The economy's not doing well.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.400]   The incumbent is very vulnerable.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.920]   And I think that's why the Republicans
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.240]   think they can run somebody as difficult to elect
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.160]   as Rick Perry, because it's going to be a very difficult
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   election for the President Obama.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.160]   And until '19, I think '88, he was Gore's campaign manager.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.160]   What?
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160]   He was a Democrat.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.920]   He was a Democrat until '98.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   He was a Democrat all through the Reagan years.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.400]   What happened?
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.160]   He got religion?
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.320]   Wait, now let's sudden everybody's Reagan, Reagan, Reagan.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.600]   And this guy hated Reagan.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.280]   And now he's a Republican out of the blue.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.520]   And he's like big government Republican.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.000]   He's forced vaccinations to the kids.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.160]   And I can go on for days.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.360]   But go to the NOAA agenda show to come to hear this crap.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.960]   You talk about this all the time.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.160]   Yeah, we should get back to it.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.240]   But if you're right and the economy's going to tank in 2013,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.960]   does any of this matter at all?
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.240]   No, actually, the way I see it with the cyclicist,
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.000]   it doesn't matter what you do.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.840]   Period.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.680]   Anytime.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.240]   Anytime.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.160]   Effy-- defeat a story.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.640]   It's a totally defeatist.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.800]   Where's your money, John?
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.680]   Cyclicist.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.240]   John's a proud defeat.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.400]   My money is short.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   Short the mark.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.040]   He's been saying this for years.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.720]   I'm getting right.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.440]   Look what's happening.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.880]   It's been going downhill day by day.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.440]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.360]   Now I'm really going to get upset because--
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.880]   I'm a cyclid.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.840]   I'm a cyclid.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.760]   You're a cyclid.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   Does that mean you don't--
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.480]   Cyclicist.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.840]   Does that mean you reproduce without--
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.920]   No, over and over again.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.200]   Yeah, OK.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.840]   Let's take a break.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.560]   When we come back, you're not a silon.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.240]   There's a big difference.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.280]   When we come back, I want to talk about the San Francisco
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.280]   Police Department and perhaps the most appalling story
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.080]   in the history of technology.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.920]   But first--
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.560]   I don't think that'll keep them listening.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.160]   What do you--
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.960]   I got to be careful with the teases.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.520]   If I tease too well, they'll sit right through the ad.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.680]   They'll say, well, I got to hear that story,
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.960]   and they'll skip the ad.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.440]   I think--
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.320]   Well, yeah, that could--
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.120]   Actually, the ad.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:47.320]   Stay tuned for the most exciting ad we've ever done
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.640]   on this week in tech.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.360]   I want to talk about go to my PC briefly.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:56.080]   Go to my PC is the remote access product
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.440]   we talked about for so long from Citrix.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.680]   I've got a 30-day trial for you.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.560]   I'll tell you how to do that in a second.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   I think one of the cool things about go to my PC
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.280]   is that you don't have to-- look at this guy, Michael Genn.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.600]   He is now the second person in a row onto it
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.600]   to not be using a laptop, but to using an iPad with a keyboard.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.120]   He's bringing more-- more and more people are doing this.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.920]   And what's interesting, I think, is that he can use go to my PC
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.800]   on that iPad to access a Windows or Mac computer
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.360]   at the office.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.720]   So now you've got the missing link that turns your iPad
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.960]   into a full-blown computer.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.720]   You could do anything you want to do,
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.520]   send and receive email, run any Windows or Mac program
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.880]   right from your iPad, access any network resource.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.280]   You get the best of both worlds, that absolute lightweight
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.760]   freedom and all the power you need.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.000]   Sets up in minutes, no IT support is required.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.960]   Now you can access all your documents and applications
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.320]   on your home or office computer anywhere you go.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.920]   Don't you love that?
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.040]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.720]   Visit go to my PC.com.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.080]   Click the Try it free button.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.640]   The offer code is--
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.600]   Twitch, if you haven't-- and by the way,
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.280]   the app for the iPad free.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.760]   A lot of companies will charge you for the service
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.240]   and then charge you more for the iPad app that drives me crazy.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.400]   This is free.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.560]   You get the iPad app.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.480]   In fact, you could actually sign up from the iPad app.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.200]   So probably the easiest way to do this
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   is if you got an iPad, download the iPad app
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.920]   and then go into it and get the free trial.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.760]   Just make sure you use the offer code Twitch when you do.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.280]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.280]   All right.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.400]   I'm going to see if I can get the chronology of this story
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.080]   right because it's so dang complicated.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.200]   CNET reported this.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.160]   I think it was on Thursday.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.480]   They said, whoa, a guy walks into a bar.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.360]   An Apple employee walks into a bar.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.000]   Tequila bar in San Francisco leaves minus one thing,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.120]   the next iPhone.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.600]   We'll call it for one of a better name.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.360]   Coincidentally.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.640]   The iPhone 5.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.360]   They say CNET says that San Francisco police
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.200]   are investigating along with Apple this missing iPhone.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.440]   SF Weekly, which is a free tablet in San Francisco,
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.000]   but they're kind of muck rakers.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.240]   They have a good quality product is quite good.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.640]   Now that we have no actual newspapers in San Francisco,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.920]   it's nice to have the weekly, right?
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.560]   You've seen what happened to your old paper,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.400]   The Examiner, right?
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.560]   Jeff, I'm sad.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.400]   Oh, well, it's not a paper anymore.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400]   It's like--
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.080]   The truth is I used to go--
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.360]   I used to edit the Sunday paper.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.560]   I'd go out to brunch on Sundays.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   I already read the paper, so I'd take the New York Times.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.320]   People would say, where did you get that?
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.400]   The paper here sucks.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.680]   That's true.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.080]   We still have the Chronicle or the Comic-Gole is some call.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.960]   But anyway, SF Weekly calls--
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.760]   they do the one thing that CNET, I guess, forgot to do.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.520]   They call the San Francisco Police Department.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.640]   They say, we don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.760]   We're not doing any investigation.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.000]   So they publish that story.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.920]   Then it gets weird.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.960]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.120]   Then it gets weird.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.600]   San Francisco Police Department says, oh, next day.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.200]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.680]   Yes, we did.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.120]   So long story short, it looks like what happened,
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.480]   according to the SFPD, is that three or four SFPD officers
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.080]   accompanied two Apple private security officials.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.560]   Posing his police.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.920]   Apparently posing his police to a man's home--
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.120]   of course, they tracked the iPhone using GPS--
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.400]   they thought to this home in San Francisco.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.840]   Sergio Calderon, he's 22 years old.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.840]   The SFPD says, we dispatched some plain clothes officers
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.200]   to accompany the Apple investigators to the person's home.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.600]   They didn't go in, apparently, according to Calderon,
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.120]   the Apple investigators, whether explicitly or biomission,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.960]   inferred that they were SFPD, showed badges.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.200]   They probably had badges that little Apple in the middle.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.160]   Apple in the middle?
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.640]   In fact, Apple Police.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.360]   Apple Police opened the door.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.800]   Very nice badges, to be sure.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.680]   And he said, I would never have let--
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   Yeah, they were very tasteful.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.560]   I've never have let them in.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.040]   If I had known they weren't police, he lets them in.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.600]   They search his residence.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.840]   He says they threaten him.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.600]   They're saying, is everybody here legal?
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:58.960]   Wow.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.800]   You could all be--
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.560]   You could be a deep trouble.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.040]   That's the worst of it.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.720]   That's the worst of it.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.880]   Assuming that Calderon's not making this up,
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.200]   because this is all his--
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.240]   It would be the point.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.880]   This is all his story.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.520]   He says, I never possessed it.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.960]   They found no iPhone.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.200]   They found no trace of an iPhone.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.400]   However, you've got to wonder, first of all,
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.480]   if these Apple investors--
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.760]   Well, they left a phone number.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.480]   This actually confirms the story a little bit,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.920]   because they left him a phone number.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   That's a good part of the story.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.840]   The guy said, and my name is Tony.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.040]   If you find anything, please call me.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.120]   Calderon gives the San Francisco Weekly Tony's card.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.960]   They call the number.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.920]   It turns out Tony is, in fact, an Apple employee,
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.960]   Anthony Colon.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.680]   He is a former police officer who works at Apple.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.880]   You know, it's how to fake it.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.480]   It looks just like a cop.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   Big beefy's got a donut.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.000]   I'm going to be in so much trouble the next time
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.600]   I go to San Francisco.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   No, you're not.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.960]   You think there's San Francisco police
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.840]   who are listening to this podcast?
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.960]   Thank God they don't listen to Twitch.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   Oh, you're just in more trouble with Apple.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.960]   No, he can't get in more trouble with Apple.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.160]   He's already blackballed.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.480]   You can't get in trouble with Apple.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.960]   No problem.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.320]   So here's his LinkedIn profile, by the way, Anthony Colon.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:10.040]   Calderon says, when they came to my house,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   they said they were SFPD.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.720]   I thought they were SFPD.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.000]   That's why I left them in.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.960]   I would not have permitted the search
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.200]   if I had known these weren't police officers.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.800]   So here's the question.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.360]   SFPD denies it at first then.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.040]   It says, yeah, OK, maybe that happened.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.120]   The SFPD says, Apple came to us saying
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.640]   they were looking for a lost item.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.560]   Let me just ask you, if John C. Devorah came to the SFPD,
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.920]   said, hey, somebody got my laptop.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.640]   Would you come with me to the guy's house?
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.280]   Would they accompany you to the guy's house?
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.800]   Remember the recent stories where the guy
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.320]   had to post all that stuff on the internet.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.400]   He had to make a blow.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.040]   He even make a cop show up.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   But even though he had the guy dead, the right, he knew
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.160]   or had pictures.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.600]   They said, we can't help you.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.840]   So the question answered your question is, no, of course not.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.640]   Apple obviously.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.840]   We have another story on the round up.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.040]   I won't go too early.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.040]   But a judge--
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.040]   I should have chatted.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.920]   In a case that I mean found where
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.080]   a woman was using an allegedly stolen laptop to do sex chat,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.120]   and the sex chat was shared then with the authorities,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.680]   that was viewed to be a violation of her privacy.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.120]   So what laptop?
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.160]   And Apple, what's amazing about this story?
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.920]   They're suing, by the way, in that case.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.760]   The couple that was chatting sex--
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.240]   Well, it's a longer story than that,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.960]   because she didn't know it was stolen.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.560]   She bought it in the parking lot.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.480]   She bought a laptop for $60.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.040]   It was a school laptop.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.960]   The school was monitoring the laptop with LoJack.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.840]   Now they're suing the LoJack folks,
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.520]   because LoJack operatives were watching these guys
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.960]   have this sex chat.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.200]   They go, hey, have you seen this?
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.120]   Look at these guys.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   They're chatting.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.520]   And when was it--
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.480]   Come on, gather around.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:47.980]   Come here.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.560]   I mean, it was her and her boyfriend.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.280]   It wasn't like some illicit sex chat.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.160]   But they spied us out there.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.880]   I think they have a pretty good lawsuit against LoJack.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.240]   So why didn't mean to go off on the detour there?
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.000]   But, you know, Josh, we're all feeling warm and gushy
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.360]   for Apple because of God bless Steve Jobs.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.000]   They come back and just show us they're still--
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.880]   They're still Apple.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.160]   But you know, the bigger story--
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.600]   I had an argument with Dan Gilmore about this on Google+.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.600]   And I love Dan Gilmore.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.680]   He's an awesome, kind of defending journalism and so on.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.120]   But there's a lot of blame about Apple on this.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.520]   And there's some blame to go around.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.800]   But this is really about police misconduct.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.080]   Absolutely.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:31.720]   To request the participation in an illegal search
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.600]   is constitutionally protected.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.120]   It's not an illegal search if you allowed a person to come in.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.920]   But the request is--
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.440]   But if you misrepresent it, that we're the police.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.280]   Now, by the way, it's important to say
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.920]   that he could still say no to the police.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.480]   He could say, where's your search warrant?
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.040]   Exactly.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.280]   But he was--
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.120]   He was trying to cooperate.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.760]   Which is by the way, the Android users out there
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.000]   should know there's an Android recorder,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.440]   and recorder or something like that.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.560]   It's quite good because you can turn off your phone
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.360]   and have this thing running constantly.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.800]   Put it in your pocket.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.320]   And it does a great job of picking up everything.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.440]   So what you should say is--
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.520]   Oh, wait a minute, my phone.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.440]   Hold on, let me turn off my phone.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.600]   And then turn on the record.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.760]   And then turn on the record.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   So you can get the--
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.640]   But you're right, Mike, the illegality here is--
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.200]   And we don't know what happened because we only have--
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.240]   You don't know what's illegal.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.640]   But it's illegal to say we're a police let us see.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.680]   I'm assuming they didn't.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.560]   I'm assuming they did.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.040]   I don't understand why they did, why the police would do this,
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.920]   even for Apple.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.800]   I mean, it's a crazy--
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.000]   That's why I exactly--
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.200]   But he isn't exactly what happened in the Gizmodo case.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.040]   But they went with them.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.280]   This is exactly what happened in the Gizmodo case.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:40.720]   They were able to get a five law enforcement agency
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:47.000]   to a group to investigate Gizmodo, to search Brian Lam's house.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   But I mean, there wasn't--
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Oh, for a stolen complaint.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.600]   Yeah, but it's all for a stolen phone.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.440]   For crying out loud, if somebody steals my phone.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   I lost phone.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.600]   Yeah, not even a stolen.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   A lost phone.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.120]   A lost item.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.520]   We don't even know which phone it is.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.720]   Is it the iPhone 5?
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.360]   Is it the updated iPhone, you know, low cost iPhone 4?
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.360]   Is it the--
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.720]   I wish Apple would lose their upcoming TV in a box.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.560]   That was the phone.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.000]   I think Apple needs to stop drinking.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   No more tequila bars for you.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Oh, he's in bars.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.040]   Killa makes my phone follow.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.600]   But apparently, there isn't any phone,
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.560]   because they never found the phone.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.240]   That's the part of the story that baffles me,
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.040]   because there was a GSM signal coming in somehow,
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.240]   or GPS signal, I'm sorry, coming in.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.680]   And it was like-- they triangulated to this guy's house.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.520]   The guy was an Apple guy.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.280]   So he must have had the phone and turned it off.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.840]   And of course, you can't-- what are you going to do?
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.560]   Chair of the guy's place apart to find the phone.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.520]   He probably has a nice little place to conceal it.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.640]   Apparently, searches can be a little book.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   Hey, it's a holiday.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   Oh, book.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   That's good.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.920]   I usually keep my drugs in a coffee can in the freezer.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.480]   It's an old theory.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.240]   And if you do your phone like that,
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.480]   it'll actually preserve the battery.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.480]   It will keep the battery.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   Well, the funny thing is-- and this is the thing that really
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.320]   gets me-- they do all of this.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.360]   This phone is going to be released in a month.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.520]   Who cares?
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520]   They care.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.040]   Apparently.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   Tremendously.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.640]   But really.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.560]   Look what happened last time.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.560]   I mean, there's--
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.560]   I agree.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.240]   You already have the pictures and all the accessories
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.280]   that go with the upcoming iPhone.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.000]   It's just the freaking phone.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.160]   It'll be out in a month.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.440]   They even published the icon looking
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.560]   like the next iPhone in-- what was it?
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.320]   The last update of iOS.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.960]   And you saw how it looked exactly like the Samsung Galaxy
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.880]   S2.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.520]   I think that if you're an Apple fan,
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.840]   what you should take this as is the very good news
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:35.120]   that Tim Cook is just as much of a jerk as Steve Jobs.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.640]   We can say Apple is in good hands.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.640]   It's not the legal department.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.640]   They're just going on their own.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.640]   I don't even know what you're just doing.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   I'm just doing that news.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   Just to stir up it.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   That's just Apple's way of doing things.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   Steve would have known.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.640]   Steve would have known.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   Steve would have been there.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.440]   Do we know what happened to the guy who was supposed to have the phone and who lost it?
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   Is he like--
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   OK, so here's--
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.440]   I'm on the same scope of this.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.680]   No, no word on the employee.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.640]   We do know the employee who lost it last time.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.640]   And I think he did not lose his job.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640]   He kept his job.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   He's working in the site.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.640]   He's already over.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640]   We know.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.080]   Maybe don't think he's a scam of publicity stunt.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   Well, that's what they said last time for the gizmodo thing, except that the two guys who
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.680]   got the phone are now being prosecuted.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.080]   Well, they can't pull back once they get the-- if the scam goes too far in law enforcement
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.360]   is involved in you filing a false police report.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.200]   So you got to let the thing finish up.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.440]   The police go through their-- on their merry way.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.640]   And then later you say, OK, we're sorry that happened.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   Here's some money.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   Don't let it bother you.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:32.920]   Definitely McCulloch and Greg Sandoval writing for CNET have the official statement from the
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   SFPD, Troy Dangerfield.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.200]   That's a great name for a police department spokesman.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.720]   Troy Dangerfield sent out a press release saying the SFPD had been involved in a consensual
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.520]   search with Sal--
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.520]   --so excited to TSA.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.720]   --a search between two adults.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   And San Francisco-- this is the press release.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.600]   San Francisco police assist Apple security with their lost property investigation.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.120]   I wish they'd assist the rest of us.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.040]   No official report of the lost item was made.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.280]   I leaned for lost a few votes.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.280]   That's interesting.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   Yeah, I leaned--
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.280]   Just one next.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.120]   I wish somebody had searched for my droid X.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.320]   What was the one?
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.720]   You lost your droid X?
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720]   No.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   That wasn't the one that I lost.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   A friend that I lent it to lost his neck.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.560]   I lost my own Nexus S.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.600]   You lost a Nexus S like this one that I just found on the floor outside?
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.640]   Uh, I can't be here because it's somewhere in San Antonio right now.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.880]   It was in South by Southwest.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.680]   I thought I had her there.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.520]   Apple-- I don't even want to do a story on the Apple iPhone launch.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   I'm done.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.520]   I'm done on this.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.480]   Mobile patent threats from open wave and YLAN.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   Who cares?
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.000]   Apple wins German Adunction Junction.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.480]   What is with the Germans, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   You bill have?
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.560]   No, Galaxy tab?
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.280]   This is Godwin's law in reverse.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.200]   Apple has an in German injunction against the Galaxy tab 7.7.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.840]   It was going to be announced and shown at IFA, which is the big German consumer electronic
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.440]   show going on right now.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   Nope, don't get to show it because--
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.680]   Actually, they announced it.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.440]   They showed it at the press conference.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.920]   But it's not on the show.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.480]   Tons of friends of mine and colleagues got to try it out.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.800]   But on what was the first or second day of the show, police descended upon the Samsung
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.520]   booth and said, you have to take these away and take the signs down.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   Apple won't please.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.520]   San Francisco police.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.160]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   This wasn't SFPD.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.160]   It was the Dusseldorf Regional Court.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:33.440]   And I mean, all based on that ruling that says that if you do a tablet that looks like
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.400]   a tablet, then it's infringing on the iPad.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   Because it's so--
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.400]   It's like an iPad.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400]   Yeah, it is so--
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   It's like an iPad.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.400]   Yeah, but this doesn't look like an iPad.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.400]   It doesn't at all.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   Not in the weeks.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.680]   But there's no downside for Apple to do this.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.680]   They get publicity.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   Right, sure.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.960]   They get interference with a competitor.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.560]   Maybe they'll win something in the courts.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.400]   It's all gravy for Apple.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.680]   Apple doesn't even want to do a 7-inch, right?
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.120]   I mean, as far as they think so.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   We know.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.120]   Steve said that no 7-inch.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   Now we have Amazon.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.400]   You couldn't do anything really worthwhile with it.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.040]   Well, let's talk about M.G. Seagler.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   Boy, did he get a scoop.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:12.440]   M.G. Seagler TechCrunch says the Amazon Kindle tablet is very real.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   I've seen it.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.440]   I've played with it.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.840]   Now, that's a hell of a scoop.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.000]   He says it'll be called the Amazon Kindle.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.960]   It's 7-inch capacitive touchscreen.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.100]   It runs Android, but no Android you've ever seen before because Amazon has completely
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.480]   redesigned the user interface.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.920]   There are no buttons.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   There are no buttons.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   There are no Google apps.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.720]   There's no Google marketplace.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.080]   There's no Google anywhere.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.800]   If apparently Google isn't involved in this at all, they just took the open source Android
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.280]   and mucked with it.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.360]   He says it looks a little bit like a BlackBerry playbook in terms of form factor, which actually
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.040]   is what that Samsung looks like as well.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.120]   7-inch tablets seem to be all kind of similar.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:57.120]   Even as we speak, Berlin police are flying to Seattle to...
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.760]   It's multi-touch, but he says he thinks it's two-finger multi-touch, which is a little
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.080]   different than the Apple iPad.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.040]   I've heard that rumor elsewhere.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.920]   This all seems very credible to me because Amazon doesn't want to be Sony.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.920]   They want to be Gillette.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.720]   They want a device that's designed for buying stuff on Amazon.com.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   That's what they want.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   That's clearly what this is.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   Clearly.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.480]   Essentially what they've done is they take the Kindle thing and they've extended it to
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.560]   movies, music, all kinds of stuff and also optimize it for the store.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.160]   I think this is totally legit and it makes a lot of sense.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.640]   Here's the value proposition.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:39.800]   According to MG, $250 for a 7-inch and you get free Amazon Prime, which is an $80 value,
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.400]   that means I'm a prime member and I think Amazon Prime is the best marketing thing I've
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.400]   ever heard of in my life.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.080]   I mean, yeah, I love the free shipping.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.000]   $29, you pay them for the privilege of having two-day shipping for free.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.400]   It means that you just buy everything from Amazon.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   From now on.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   So here's a prediction.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   That's a great gimmick.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.400]   Here's a prediction.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.120]   I predict when in two years they're going to flip it.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.360]   Instead of Amazon, instead of free Amazon Prime with a $250 Kindle, you're going to get
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   a free Kindle.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   With Amazon.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.520]   With Amazon Prime because the Moore's Law is going to bring the costs down and this is
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.600]   a spectacularly subsidizable device.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.440]   The entire function is to get you to spend money on Amazon.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.280]   It's a doorway to Amazon.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.280]   Exactly.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   It's free shipping for electronic media.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   Right.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.680]   Well, the amazing thing about this, you've got Chicago Tribune and Philadelphia Inquirer
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:33.160]   both considering trying to sell Amazon tablets, which is insane because how much do you really
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.600]   use a newspaper?
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:40.640]   But Amazon, you really know the lifetime value, net future value of a customer and you can
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.600]   really account for the subsidy.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.520]   Right.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:50.120]   He says the key for Amazon is just how deeply integrated all of their services are.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.320]   Amazon's content store is always just one click away.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.880]   The book reader is a Kindle app.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.120]   The music player is Amazon's cloud player.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.440]   The movie player is Amazon's instant video player.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.080]   The app store is Amazon's app store.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.040]   I mean, it's right there, isn't it?
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.880]   This is a basically a way to remove money from my wallet.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.400]   And it reduces the cost of Prime.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.200]   Now that it's so easy to order digital instead of actual all the time, you're reducing the
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.960]   shipping costs and the inventory costs and all this huge cost structure for Amazon.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.960]   It's brilliant.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.000]   The more they can get us to do this, the better.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.560]   And again, even if you don't get this, you'll still do the same things on your iPad.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.520]   Do you think, John, this is a good idea.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.000]   These things, this is, John's the naysayer.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   We're saying this is it.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   They're going to win.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.720]   It's a huge, we're kind of going to say nay.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.280]   I think it's great.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.280]   Oh, shoot.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.320]   Amazon, my wife is this morning.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.560]   My wife was saying, everyone's going to Wild John's say something's great.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.240]   I do say something.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.200]   If you actually paid attention, I say more things are great.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.040]   I rarely am critical.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   What?
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040]   Come on.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.040]   What?
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.000]   It's all been recorded, you know that.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.720]   You've grown the year.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   By the way, I think that Bezos is a little wacky with his rocket ship.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   The rocket.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   Oh, yeah, he had to destroy it.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.280]   Everyone's going to blow up on him.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.280]   You know, this has been a thing.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   Really?
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.280]   Do you think it's a good idea to have guys to get, they make billions of dollars in.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.280]   So they build submarines or rockets?
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.760]   What would you do with billions of dollars?
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.920]   I would build rockets.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   I would.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.560]   I think I'd relax a little bit.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560]   Oh, no.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.560]   I don't want to build a rocket.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   You'd do something wacky.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.080]   I'd rather build, but here's my issue with this.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.360]   Here's my issue with this.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.040]   This rocket went up.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   As with all rockets, there's a self-destruct button in case it goes off course because
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.600]   you don't want to hit civilians.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   You know, kind of.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   There's a 42,000 feet in the boat.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.240]   The Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.800]   But do you really want the guy who's got the finger on the button to self-destruct this
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.400]   thing be the guy who paid for it, Jeff Bezos?
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.000]   Wouldn't you like what some engineer who's like just a roa-
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   More objective.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   More objective.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Flip it around.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.800]   If I paid for it, I would want my finger.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.560]   Well, he pushed the button.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.560]   Good.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   Good.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.560]   Good on him.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   He pushed the button.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   That's an old market.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.560]   It looks like something out of the day, the Earth stood still.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.800]   The CEO of Apple was this same guy.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.440]   Oh, Mike Scott.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.120]   Scott, he became a rocketeer.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.280]   And then, Vincent, I think you spent all his money on rockets.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.120]   But all these guys, Paul Allen's a rocket guy.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   Is he?
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.920]   He's the one who sponsors the Root 10.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   X-Pace.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.080]   The one that actually got up and came back.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   I like that.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.080]   With some guys.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.560]   You know, I was in some maniac was in the damn thing.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:35.120]   Elon Musk getting a lot of heat right now because he has an 8RV camp at Burning Man.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.000]   It's personal chefs.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Guys changing.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Is it Butler?
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.440]   It's apparently there's a whole article of how Burning Man has just jumped the shark.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.600]   Oh, I jumped the shark a lot.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   Burning Man about self reliance.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.600]   Apparently not.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.760]   This is supposed to be about art.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.600]   In fact, they asked Harvey the guy in charge of Burning Man.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   They said, well, what is this?
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   What do you mean?
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   He said, well, no, we have radical inclusion.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.280]   That means even including very rich people who want to drive in in there, you can apparently
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.200]   now rent an RV like there's a company that does this and they will give you the luxury
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   Burning Man experience.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.640]   If you come into Burning Man on a rocket, you really want to make it.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.640]   Yes.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.640]   The president coming in on a chopper.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.080]   Didn't Larry Page come in on a chopper once?
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.080]   I think so.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.600]   Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.800]   During Burning Man, all the people at Google are off.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.000]   They're all like Burning Man is the Google event.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.280]   They all go.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.880]   They make a point of it and the company's basically shut down for that week.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.880]   Have you guys been?
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   No.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.080]   I was at the first Burning Man on the beach on Ocean Beach.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.080]   Yeah, I was driving by.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   I got out there.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.080]   The RV lights are burning off.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.840]   Something I said, it was a big bonfire.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.880]   I'm surprised I didn't get away with that and I took off.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.160]   That was the end of it.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.720]   John C. de Vorek, I was at the first Burning Man.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.640]   I was there when I was a kid.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.800]   It was in 1942.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.440]   We burned a real man.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.360]   I think it was '86, actually.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.840]   The first Kindle will be the color Kindle.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.600]   This new Android Kindle Wi-Fi only.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.040]   Apparently they are working to make 3G versions, but they won't be 3G right away.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.280]   MG says he doesn't know what the battery life is like.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.840]   He says the back of the device is rubbery.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.840]   No camera.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   No camera.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.840]   Micro USB port.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.120]   By the way, that rubbery coating.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.720]   I love that.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.800]   Wait until 10 years down the road.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.560]   I've got some old devices that had that coating on it and the stuff turns into some weird
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.120]   glue because of the ozone.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.560]   If you run into this, stick the old product here.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:27.600]   It's like I ran into one of my Sony DAT recorders, had that crap on it.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.160]   I go, I say, "What the hell happened to my recorder?
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.040]   He must have spilled orange juice on it."
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   It's gooey.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.040]   It was all gooey and sticky.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   That's a feature.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.040]   That's a feature.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.880]   They don't want you hanging on to this thing for 10 years.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.240]   I'm telling you, this is a bad...
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.240]   Two years.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.240]   This coating stinks.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.400]   Who keeps this stuff for 10 years?
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.480]   A DAT recorder?
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.040]   What are you doing with a DAT recorder?
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.040]   I record that.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   What a bad...
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.040]   DAT.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.040]   That's nice.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.040]   That's nice.
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.040]   What would take?
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.440]   One thing that didn't really come out in any of the stories covering the new Kindle,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.120]   the upcoming Kindle, is that it sort of signifies the fact that Amazon is going to move
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.800]   into serious content as opposed to just books.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.440]   Because I mean, if it's just to read books, all you need is what...
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   Don't eat it.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.440]   You don't eat it.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.440]   You don't eat it.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   What the Kindle is today?
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   You need color and you need a fast screen.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   How much is the cost?
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   $113 subsidized.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   There you go.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.600]   Bizos is a genius.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.760]   He is a visionary and I don't think he's appreciated as such.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   He's got...
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.120]   Think of how compelling that is.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.160]   You're sitting there and you read a movie review, so you just watch the movie.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.160]   Right there.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.160]   You know, it's a point of access.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   It's every...
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.600]   And look at how simple they've made it on the Kindle with, you know, like included the
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.400]   3G that you don't really pay for.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.480]   And look at how they market the Kindle.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.240]   You go to the homepage and it's got the prime position.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.040]   Every time you go to the Amazon.com homepage.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.320]   Remember when the iPad was launched?
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   When we went...
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:53.280]   Some of us said, me included, I think that's the end of the road for the Kindle.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.360]   Who's going to buy a Kindle for 200 more dollars?
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   I thought so.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.560]   And you know, just Bizos is still laughing.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.120]   Why were we wrong?
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:06.000]   Is it because they have this prominent positioning right on the front page of the best commerce
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   site in the world?
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   It helps.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   It chip away, I cheat.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   It's just so easy.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.560]   There was a book the Times review today about A&P as the big disruptor.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.520]   And I thought, wow, this sounds really good.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.680]   I ordered a book and Bingo, 30 seconds later, it's there, it's done.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   As a writer, I wrote a piece for Wired Germany on Gutenberg as the original technology entrepreneur.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.360]   I couldn't sell it to a magazine here and I thought, screw it, I'm going to put it in
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.080]   as a Kindle single.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.840]   And I'll sell it for 99 cents.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.600]   And it's just become so fluid and easy now.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.600]   Content becomes far less sludgy.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.600]   Remember when Jerry Feynell was on, John, and he was talking about how well his daughter
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.080]   had done selling ebooks.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.640]   And you were talking about getting your old columns compiled and that...
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.640]   Did you do that?
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.200]   It's one of my many projects.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.280]   You were ready to put those columns together and sell them on the Kindle.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   I buy them.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.280]   It's coming any minute.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   I would too.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.880]   The old info world columns would be great.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.880]   Absolutely.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.520]   No, I think so.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.080]   I think there's a market for the good old days.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.080]   People love reading old crap.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.000]   Old crap that costs you nothing.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.200]   John, what was the first, what was the first technology piece you ever wrote?
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.000]   I wrote a piece in 1979 for InfoWorld on the Fortune Computer.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.760]   Fortune, I remember that.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.360]   Yeah, I broke that story.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.360]   We were going to buy one.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   It was a multi-user computer.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.960]   Yeah, I was going to buy one.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   It was a Unix machine.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   It was pretty sweet.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   Game and went.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.520]   John, did you like it or not at the time?
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   You nasty then?
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.520]   Oh, he was an ice guy then.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.520]   No, I was the same as I've always been.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.920]   That's the first technology piece.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.000]   I mean, you used to write for the college newspaper and the high school movie.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.400]   He was a wine writer though in the early '70s.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.360]   I also did some wine writing in the early '70s.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   We have a hot time imagining the '30s.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   I was a pre-cranky dvorak.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360]   Pre-crank-y.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.800]   No, pre-crank-y dvorak.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   I know.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   I've worked with it for years.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   I've made the big bucks by being cranky.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   You were now like you.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   You were now like you.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   You were the '79s guy in the '79.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.480]   '79 was your first.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.040]   First technology article.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.200]   I think my-- I was just shortly thereafter.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.000]   I think my first was-- I wrote an article for Bite Magazine.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.760]   There was a review of some Atari software in like the early '80s.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   So--
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.760]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.200]   How did you get so far out of me?
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   Because you're a good writer, that's why.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.560]   Because you were doing radio.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.560]   Oh, radio.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.440]   That's going to go places.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.240]   By the way, if you're a ham--
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.720]   Yes, I am a ham.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.040]   And I don't know if you can go over there and you can play with our ratings.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.920]   I can go get some nice radios over there.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.080]   Log on or whatever their kids call that today.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.360]   KJ6.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.720]   LNG, which is--
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.960]   Liquid Johnson.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   Liquid natural gas.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   Natural gas.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   Exactly.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   And I'm whiskey six--
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   Wis-- Tango, whiskey, Tango.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.240]   You took-- you paid money for your--
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.080]   I paid $29.95, baby.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   Is that what it is?
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.080]   Yes, cheap.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   Oh.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   I like mine.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   I like yours.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.080]   Natural gas.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   I can remember that.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   How much time do you spend on that?
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   Zero.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   But if all hell breaks loose--
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.080]   I'm ready.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.080]   That's right.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   It's only for emergency.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.560]   We have the state of the art ham system.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.240]   I mean, this is the state of the art thing over here.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.160]   I saw the presentation.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.160]   It's amazing.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.680]   You know, you had some guys help you out.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.160]   I didn't do-- diddly do.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.520]   Right, and they hooked a thing up.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.320]   And now you got like a number one rig in this--
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   I don't know what to do.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.320]   Get on it, do some CQ, CQ.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.320]   CQ, CQ.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.960]   I did actually-- I've done one.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.960]   You get-- anybody say hi?
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.760]   Yeah, I've done one.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   But then what they do-- so much RF noise coming out of this building.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   Who to thunk it?
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.160]   That I can't actually use it.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.160]   Really?
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   Huh.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.160]   Really?
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.160]   Yeah, who to thunk it?
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   Do you see the big AM transmitter?
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   The Collins transmitter?
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.160]   Is that a beauty?
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   That's the state of the art.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.160]   It's all in 1961.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.240]   When the wind of the art comes near and near, and you can crank that baby back up and we
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   be on the air.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.840]   It's a Woban Jack, Carlin out here at the end of the world.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.480]   Well what I like to see the Hams do, and I'll talk to you about this sometimes.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   Which is modernized.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.280]   Modernized what they can do.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:48:00.080]   In other words, some wide band stuff, some high speed.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.760]   They're starting to spread spectrum.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:07.000]   There are actually very sophisticated Hams that were doing exactly that other.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Before there were cell phones.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Yeah, legally.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.920]   Before there were cell phones, they were doing auto patch where you would use your
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.080]   handy talkie to get to a repeater who the guy would then make a phone call for you.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.720]   These guys have been around for a long time doing some amazing things.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.680]   They're still, believe it or not, doing cutting edge stuff I think.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.600]   Well PSK 31 apparently is something I should look into.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.680]   Yes, and there's a lot of data stuff.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   PSK 31.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.240]   Yeah, I also want to get a big dish.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.240]   Yeah, the big giant one.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   Like a 10-year.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:39.120]   Because they have this four, whatever it's called, this HD that now comes down the big
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.120]   place.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   Really?
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.560]   Yeah, it's all free and you can buy what's cool about the big--
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.600]   Can you watch a Colombian soccer game?
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.240]   It's cool about a big dish is that you can get HBO by the minute.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   What?
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.720]   So there's a bunch of services out there.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.720]   You can just sign--
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.720]   That's a great service.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   You sign up and you say--
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.320]   I'd like to buy 60 minutes of madmen.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.320]   Exactly.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.040]   And you can be-- and you'll give you the-- boom, all of a sudden your little converter thing
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.120]   turns on and you watch for 60 minutes and it turns off.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   And it turns off.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.680]   And you pay for that instead of paying these.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.040]   Ludicrous hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month for--
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.520]   For more bungling.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   Right.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.520]   So--
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.520]   This is how the mini tail worked.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.520]   Getting the full scoring final.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.520]   By the minute.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:20.760]   Do you remember-- what did they stop doing this where in Europe you'd go and you put a
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   coin in and the phone would work and then in your home?
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   And there was a meter.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   Remember that?
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   It was a meter on the phone.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   No.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   I never seen that before.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.600]   I've actually seen that in like B&Ds and--
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   But it was just the breakfast.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   No, I was in houses where they--
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.360]   Is this the same place that had the vibrating bed look?
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.160]   Magic fingers, baby.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.720]   Hey, speaking of magic, I got the magic in web design here.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.720]   We're going to take a break.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   Come back with more with John C. Devorak.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.400]   Mike Elgin, Cedric Ingrand from TCI.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   Not T-I.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.400]   L-C-I.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   What is--
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.400]   L-C-I.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   Are they related?
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   The news channels, sure.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   We're 100% owned by TF1, so there's a--
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   So that's tele France.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   Yes.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.400]   And then L-C-I is--
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.880]   The session up for which means the news channel.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   It's like the CNN--
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:00.880]   Absolutely.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   Of France.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.880]   There you go.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:04.880]   Or say on on.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   Sorry.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   I don't know.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   Anyway, it's great to have you, Cedric.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.880]   Cedric just did a story on us for Planet Cranny's show on his--
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.000]   We do buy yearly stories.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.480]   We come every two years and see how you're doing--
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.240]   How years ago you came here.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.200]   And you know, first, second floor of this-- this multitude cottage.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.840]   And you were alone editing your own shows and saying, "Maybe I'm going to get an intern."
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.440]   And now you have what, 16 people.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.440]   Come a long way, baby.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.440]   There's more people in the audience.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.440]   You'll be coming to square.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.440]   Look at this.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.440]   How many--
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.440]   Where are you all from?
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.280]   There was-- we've got about 20 people, 30 people in the audience today.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.960]   Costa Mesa, Orange County.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.960]   Canada.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   Canada?
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   We're in Canada.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.960]   Calgary, Montreal.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   It's a little confused.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.960]   Where?
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   Switzerland.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.960]   Switzerland.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.960]   Switzerland.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.960]   Oh, crap.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   Is that great?
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.960]   You don't like Swiss?
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.960]   I love the Swiss, but I mean, it's even further away than I came from.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:54.960]   Oh, crap.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.960]   Switzerland.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   I've been dodging those guys for years.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   Where in Switzerland are you from?
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   Geneva.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.960]   I've heard of that.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.960]   Is that spelled with a G or a J?
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   Because I have a watch where it's spelled with a J.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.960]   I think there's something wrong.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:08.960]   That you bought in Shenzhen with a mess.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.960]   I did, yeah.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.400]   We'll be back with more.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.400]   A great panel.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.040]   John's wandered off as usual.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.600]   Be careful, because when John wanders, he takes things.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.600]   He's looking for stuff.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.120]   What did you find over there?
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.880]   I want to talk a little bit about squarespace.com.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:28.360]   The secret behind exceptional websites, we use Squarespace for our InsideTwit blog.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.520]   And I'm so impressed.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.680]   That thing never goes down.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.120]   All of you go to inside.twit.tv.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.560]   You cannot bring that site down.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.040]   And that just speaks to their hosting.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.200]   Squarespace is more than just the best web hosting in the world.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.960]   It's also the best content management software running on top of that.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.120]   And why do you want to do that?
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.360]   Well, they keep it up to date.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.320]   Automatic updates, automatic security fixes.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.760]   It's the best content software out there.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.840]   It's really spectacular.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:00.680]   And as all the features you're looking for, you can import from the major APIs, moveable
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.560]   type, WordPress type pad and blogger.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.400]   But you're not just importing the posts.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.640]   You're getting all the links, all the images, all the comments.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:12.400]   What SEO has preserved, the links are actually not even changed.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.360]   And you can export it back out so you're never trapped.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.000]   Their iPhone and iPad app is spectacular.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.360]   What a great way to not only post but moderate comments, even look at your statistics.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.320]   And boy, do they have a stats package.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.760]   You can tell exactly what people are doing when they visit your site.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.920]   All the links, the SEO is fantastic.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.320]   They have site maps, all the stuff that you need to get the best possible Google rankings.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.840]   And this is all automatic.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:42.120]   If you want to include your social content, like your Twitter or your Flickr or your Facebook,
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.280]   it's all easy to do.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.080]   Just like the rest of the design tools, their point and click, drag and drop couldn't be
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.080]   easier.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.760]   Twitter, look at that.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.880]   In fact, even just any arbitrary RSS.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.440]   But I'm just giving you, I'm just scratching the surface.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.240]   The best thing to do is to go to squarespace.com right now.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.600]   And you see that green button?
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.600]   You could try it free.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.600]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.600]   You don't need an offer code.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.240]   You just press that button.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   You need three things.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.400]   A name for your site.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.000]   A password in your email address.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   And for the next two weeks, you get a full, complete trial of squarespace.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.800]   Nothing is inhibited or no watermarks.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.320]   You get the full site.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.920]   And this is the best way to see if this is right for you.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:21.840]   This is what I want you to do.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.280]   Now, if you decide to buy, I do encourage you to use our Twit offer code, which is
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.560]   Twit 9, TWIT 9.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.120]   Because they'll take 10% off for the first six months of your site.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.480]   So that's worthwhile.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.560]   Sites start as little as $12 a month.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.600]   It's hosting and the best software out there.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   Squarespace.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.800]   These are great guys.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.800]   They do a great product.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.120]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.080]   And I just looked at the numbers.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.520]   They are our number one advertiser now on TWIT.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.480]   So we're very happy to have them along.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.040]   They keep this show on the road.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.480]   Thank you Squarespace.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.120]   And if you want to support TWIT, I'd really appreciate it if you visit squarespace.com
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   and give it a try today.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   Wow.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:05.920]   Every time I get up, the dog sits in my chair.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   He likes it.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.800]   Or do you have meat in your pocket?
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   I do.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   Always carry meat.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   Yes, they can.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.880]   You have 13 of those bouncy balls back there.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   We do.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.880]   Did you count them?
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.880]   You really did.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.320]   You know, it was my thought that when we had an audience come here that they would
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.920]   like to sit on the same kind of ball I sit on.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.920]   You know, really?
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.920]   Not on one of them.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   Yeah, I don't blame them.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920]   Not on one of them.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   And then comfy chairs over there.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:27.920]   They're sitting in.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.960]   And then I also got two ginormous beanbags.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.840]   Oh, sumo, have you seen the sumo beanbags?
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.840]   No.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.080]   Oh my God, these are so great.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.160]   But they're so big.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:40.200]   Well, I think the real reason is they're embarrassed because it's like you're sleeping
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   during the show.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.200]   You know, it's very comfy.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   The beanbag or there's...
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.360]   No, it's like a giant nest.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   We have the...
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   Which one do we have?
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   The sumo...
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.640]   He sent us the Titan.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   That's what we have.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.080]   We have two sumo titans.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.440]   These are the world's largest beanbags.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.760]   That'd be fun.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   They're so comfy.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   Well, there...
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:58.760]   You want to try it?
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   Is somebody using it?
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.760]   Yeah, they see people looking back there.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.880]   I think the dog is using it.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   The dog?
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.720]   No, we don't let the dog in the Titan.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.720]   We have a micro-suede one and we have a quarter-right one and they are so comfortable.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.800]   I often find our staff napping in them.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.000]   Well, they probably fall asleep.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   They fall right asleep.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   They're very comfortable.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   I want to see the borac in one.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   Bring...
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Chance is going to go get one of you.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Yeah, I'm not going to get it.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   You can do the rest of the show for the beanbag.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   You use something to be ridiculed.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.600]   Well, it's actually hard to get out of.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.600]   It's hard.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.320]   Help me, help me.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.320]   I'm stuck in the beanbag chair.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.800]   I'm falling, I can't get up.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   Like a turtle.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   Like an AT&T contract.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   Apple?
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   Is this it?
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   Oh.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.520]   There's an early termination fee for that beanbag.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.520]   You want out?
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.520]   It'll cast you 350.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.000]   Elgin's on a roll.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   There it is.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Look at this.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Wow.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   That thing is way too big.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   Hey, hey, go ahead, James.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Sit in it.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   Sit in it.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Come on.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Jeff over.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   I want somebody to sit in it.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Who wants to be a volunteer?
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Whoa!
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Oh, what's your name?
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Jeff, they knocked you over.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Ooh.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.280]   Well, at least the wine didn't go flying.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.040]   I'm saving that wine glass.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.040]   Isn't that great?
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.040]   Isn't that great?
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.040]   They're so comfy.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.960]   I really want to thank the folks at the...
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.480]   I've been meaning to plug this from this.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.680]   I'd like to add you the wine glass being in front of Jeff.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.040]   It's kind of a virtual prop.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.040]   Yeah, you can drink.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.720]   Drink if you want to.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.640]   Drink them if you got them.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.720]   Moving along.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.440]   Let's talk about Mike Harrington.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.080]   Why?
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.360]   I think here's my theory.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.320]   So Mike Harrington sold TechCrunch.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.520]   You know, TechCrunch is a great tech blog.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.040]   I read it religiously.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.600]   It's the place where what this MG Seagler article we just talked about.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.240]   I mean, these guys get great scoops.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.640]   And Mike Harrington is a character.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:44.920]   He's really adept at writing posts that just, you know, for me, my blood, my head turns
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.160]   red and steam comes out of my ears.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.840]   Or you go, "Wow, I can't believe you said that."
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.800]   Now, when AOL bought him, I thought this is a mismatch.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.080]   You talk about the screw you, Mike Harrington.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   You had that one.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   The guy I said, "Screw you two."
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   But I like Mike.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   We've talked since then.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.080]   I think Mike's great.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.440]   You know, he's funny.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.440]   I saw him at Food Camp.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.440]   He says, "I don't know.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   Should I shake your hand?
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.440]   I don't know.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   Are you going to hit me?"
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.440]   "No, Mike, I'm going to hit him.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.440]   You had your chance."
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.440]   "Wam!"
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.440]   No, I have nothing against Mike Harrington.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:13.680]   And I was watching with great interest because I thought there's no way.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.040]   Mike Harrington and Ariana Huffington are going to get along or stop.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.040]   I'm not.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   They ousted him and put it in a new job.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   That's what's interesting.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.480]   You know, normally this is what happens, right?
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.920]   If you acquire a company and then there's a deal that says you have to work for us for
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.080]   three years or some period.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.560]   Reasonably, because TechCrunch is Mike Harrington.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.720]   And non-compete, no.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.720]   And non-compete.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:37.480]   I think from day one, Mike Harrington did everything he could to get fired.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   What does he do?
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.600]   He says to him, he says, "The number one property at AOL is in gadget."
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.720]   He says, "In gadgets, these guys are terrible.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.720]   They're not as journalists.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.120]   This is a crap blog."
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.920]   I mean, he's slim.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.760]   He's got style, I guess.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.560]   Then what does he do to get fired?
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.280]   He did something else that was...
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   I understand he walked around the office naked for one day.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   Oh, no.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   Really?
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   He's a hard-go-on.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   I think he was trying to save his job.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   I'm just kidding.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.280]   Or just possible.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   Oh, I know.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:13.240]   They had an AOL company memo that was circulated and said, "Don't whatever you do.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.360]   This is our new AOL chat service."
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.760]   And immediately he publishes it.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.360]   He's just like, "You know, of course I'm going to publish this.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.560]   I'm TechCrunch to prove his independence."
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.400]   But I think also he's trying to get out of there.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.400]   Sure.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.040]   So finally, then he announces, "I'm going to invest in the company's recovery."
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.040]   I've been in trouble.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.800]   He has an on-out clause in his contract and the sale of TechCrunch.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:39.200]   So there's a lot of money to be lost for him if he doesn't go up to the end of whatever
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   the contract says.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   Of course.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.200]   So what do he wants to do?
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   He was probably fired.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.240]   Yeah, there's probably some way he wants an AOL to say, "Hey, Mike, take the money and
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.240]   run because you're a company."
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:54.560]   If that were the case, then why would AOL have been a co-investor in the new fund?
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.560]   Well, and that's what I agree.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.720]   And this is what's kind of interesting.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.560]   And he can still write for the site.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.000]   I mean, what has really changed?
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.760]   I mean, he can't get paid for his post.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.440]   He's no longer managing editor.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.920]   Well, even that, it's still confused, I think, as to whether or not he's fired or not from
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:11.880]   Huffington Post and AOL.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.600]   But he does have a fund.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.200]   And full disclosure is he called me today and I talked to him, but just kind of he calls
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:21.320]   me on journalistic stuff and I didn't learn anything specific about this.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:28.120]   But here's a fund here that AOL has invested in along with a lot of top VC firms.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.240]   They're like, they put half the money in.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.240]   It's like 20 million.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.520]   That's not your kiss off.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.800]   You know, that ain't your kiss off.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.840]   It's put money into a vest in the guy.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.080]   So the fund is Crunch Fund.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.120]   It's a $20 million investment fund in--
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   I'm really like Crunch Pad.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.920]   Yeah, I hope it does better than the tablet.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.440]   The Juju.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:47.480]   And by the way, this is exactly what you're not supposed to do.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.880]   He's investing in the companies.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   He covers.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.680]   He says, well, I won't write about him.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.680]   Or I don't know.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.680]   He's got some--
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:55.680]   It's corrupt.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   He's saying, you know what?
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.000]   His first response to this a couple of months ago was, eh, all journalists are corrupt.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.240]   At least you know I'm corrupt or at least you know what he said.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.760]   He basically, he said, everybody has a reason.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:12.720]   They're sleeping with somebody or everybody has a conflict of interest.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.880]   With me, you know.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:19.840]   Now of course, by the way, when he said they're married to, it was a direct prod, a Karis
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:25.360]   Swisher, who was in all things digital, is in fact married to a high-level Google executive.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.000]   But Karis closes.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.600]   But it was clearly aimed at her.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   And that's what they--
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.680]   The thing about TechCrunch is, let's not forget where it started.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:40.760]   I mean, Eridan's erranted and erranting can be difficult even more than John Cedar-Warack.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.440]   But he started by being a venture investor who happened to write a blog about the firm's
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.880]   for a reason.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.840]   And though it became more of a media property and though it shifted and though it works
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:56.200]   for Ariana and she wants to be journalist and all that, in terms of where Eridan started,
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.000]   where he is now is no different.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.920]   But now he's investing--
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920]   But he--
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   But he was before.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   But he has a job.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   I think Jarvis is right.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.320]   He temporarily divested, by the way.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   Remember this.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.800]   For several years, he said, I'm divesting.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   He wasn't successful.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.240]   Jeff wrote a brilliant post on Google+ about what is journalism.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.000]   And everybody's got to read this.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.960]   It's one of the most interesting things I've read there for a long time.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960]   But I'm going to disagree with something.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.560]   And I think I'm really in the minority on this, which is that I don't think blogging
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   is journalism.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:33.680]   I think there should be a much greater effort to separate journalism from blogging.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.280]   I think blogging is water cooler conversation.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.200]   Because in analogy, if you go back to a time when we all understood journalism better
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.120]   in 1960 or something like that, you'd read the paper, you'd have experiences, you'd go
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.280]   to work and you chit-chat about what you read and what you did.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.000]   And that's really what blogging should be.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.200]   The problem is that the public is confused about it.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.800]   The public thinks that blogs are journalism.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.560]   I think blogs are journalism.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.560]   But they shouldn't be.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.360]   And I think that's true.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.360]   There's a spectrum of what's actually published on blogs.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.560]   Something from something that's a lot like journalism or even better than journalism,
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.720]   the majority of it is just people just spouting off on random things.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720]   And so--
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.720]   Well, why can't you go on journalism?
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720]   Like this.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.720]   Because--
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.720]   Because what we're doing right now.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.720]   Exactly.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   This is a blog.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.720]   We're talking about--
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   We're talking about journalism, which is one of the things that--
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.400]   But you're adding context.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.360]   You're adding value to it.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.800]   You're adding all kinds of--
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.800]   Maybe.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   Well--
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.360]   I'm saying something about, let's say, AT&T.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.560]   And I were a major--
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.160]   I had millions of dollars invested in AT&T.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.120]   It would behoove me to disclose that.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:40.640]   Yes.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.520]   And Mike does that.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.400]   And then I guess what you're saying is trust the audience to say, oh, well, we have to
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.720]   take this with a grain of salt.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.360]   Well, there was a white post.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:55.960]   Yeah, in response to my post on Google+, the guy named, I think, SaaS, we're going to post
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.760]   say in these that you shouldn't trust anyone.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.760]   Journalist or anyone else?
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.760]   That's Mike's position.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.920]   Let's see, when I read the New York Times--
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.000]   I was going to say the Wall Street Journal.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   When I read the New York Times--
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   --we're going to say the Wall Street Journal.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   Good last minute correction.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.640]   You know, they snoop on phones and stuff like that.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.600]   Anyway, so if I read a newspaper like the New York Times, I have certain expectations
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.520]   about how they source the information.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.160]   I mean, they make mistakes like everybody else.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.040]   But they're trying to live up to an ideal, which you mentioned, Jeff, in your piece,
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.960]   of journalism, journalistic integrity, and so on.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.080]   If they find somebody who's across the line, they go after them.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.680]   And all that kind of stuff, I expect that when I read the New York Times.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.560]   When I go to a blog, I shouldn't expect that.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.200]   Some people expect-- I do both.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.600]   I do journalism, and I also do blogging.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.240]   And I really switch hats there.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.880]   I mean, when I'm doing journalism, I'm like, I have to do-- there's a long list of things
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.880]   that I do because this is journalism.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.240]   When I go blog, I'm just spouting off about stuff.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.680]   And the people reading my blog shouldn't be--
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.600]   You have a guilty conscience about your blogging is what you're really saying.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600]   Exactly.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.840]   But in addition to that, I really don't want people to think that I've explored every
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.840]   angle that I've--
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.840]   But Mike, you're sitting there.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.840]   You're sitting there.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.840]   You're sitting there reading it.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.840]   For example, combination.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.120]   John C. de Vorack gives me reporting, gives me scoops, gives me information, but also gives
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.480]   me his opinion and perspective, which I value in that, right?
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480]   John?
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480]   Yes, exactly.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.960]   I just want to point out that Jeff Jarvis looks like the disembodied head in a Disney
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.120]   ride, temporary--
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.120]   I know.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.120]   I know.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.120]   Not in the close-up, but just floating here.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   It's like, what the heck?
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.120]   We've got a ghost here.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120]   The ghost of Christmas passed.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.120]   And I think it's frozen too.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.120]   The ghost is frozen.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.120]   And look, it's frozen.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.120]   The ghost is frozen.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.120]   And I froze.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.120]   I mean, you set me, please.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:43.120]   There are no windows, and there are no doors.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.120]   I do remember that.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   He goes on that ride every time he's in the neighborhood.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.120]   I love that ride.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.120]   It's my favorite ride.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.880]   It's funny how mostly people I met in San Francisco this week were willing to talk about the
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:59.760]   Michael Arrington story, but not in the angle of conflicts of interest.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.720]   Can he still be a blogger or journalist?
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   No, no, no.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.760]   Most of these I talked to, which saw remain nameless, were web entrepreneurs.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.960]   And most of them said, would you like to have Mike Arrington as an investor?
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.920]   Oh, it's scary.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.080]   That's scarier than Jeff's head.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.880]   Because he's super smart, but he's also super inflammatory.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.880]   Exactly.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.720]   Well, you know, it'll be interesting to see how this works out.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.480]   Well, of course, you take money from Mike Arrington because you're hoping what he will write
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:27.480]   about you.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.480]   Exactly.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   And therein lies the problem.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.680]   It's a problem and not a problem.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.560]   I mean, either way, I see it, everything should be disclosed to some, you know, to the most
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.240]   that you can disclose without boring people's stuff.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.040]   And just let people, I think the public needs to be more responsible.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.360]   Well, I do think you're right.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.000]   We're entering an age now.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   Do you think it's secret?
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.800]   Where the notion of the impartial journalist is pretty much dead.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.080]   The Times is it?
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:58.880]   You know, entering an age used to be back in before my time, by the way, in the 1800s,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.880]   the papers used to be very partisan.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.520]   There used to be the general journalism.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.000]   No, before that was the Santa Rosa Democrat.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   Right.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   It was the such and such.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.680]   The paper was a Democrat paper and towners were a public and they were, they were, they
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.400]   were, they would go after each other.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.680]   Now then they came up with the Columbia.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.680]   So Jeff, you're the professor of journalism.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   When did we, when, how did this happen that we got this notion of the journalist as the
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.320]   independent reporter of facts?
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.320]   Is that pretty relevant?
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   Is that pretty relevant recent?
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   Yeah, it is very recent.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.800]   It's the last half century or so.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.760]   And it came when TV killed the second and third, the Democrat Republican papers.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.160]   You ended up with one paper.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.160]   That paper had to serve all.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.920]   It was a market decision to serve everybody.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   Meanwhile, TV, of course, isn't really news.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.920]   Right.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.240]   It's its own separate thing.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.360]   So, so you got this, this tapioca versus in the UK where you have the Guardian on the
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:54.720]   left and the Telegraph on the right and you can triangulate and everyone knows their
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:00.120]   perspective and you can hold them to the, you know, intellectual honesty of what they
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.120]   do.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.720]   Here, I think we, you know, objectivity is a lie.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720]   It doesn't exist.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.400]   It never did.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.560]   It's part of the priesthood we have.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.400]   And part of my story, part of my point of the post, I wrote, and thank you very much, Mike,
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:16.280]   for saying nice things, is that if you look at the combination of Harrington and then Jay
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.560]   Rosen went after Henry Blodgett for using anonymous sources, Henry came back and said
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.240]   it's how I get the truth.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.400]   You look at Irene coverage on cable, which, forget the over-hyped question, it was underreported.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.000]   You look at what's happening with WikiLeaks right now.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.040]   What I'm committing to is I think that we in journalism get so much with our knickers
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:39.400]   and knots about what is journalism, whereas the world says, what's information?
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.040]   What do I need to know today?
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.560]   And Mike Harrington delivers information.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.840]   Henry Blodgett delivers information.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.080]   Whether they do it under the canadains of journalism.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.760]   Well, that's really a separate question.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.800]   Just as newspapers responded to the threat of television and the fact there was a single
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.120]   journalist, a journal newspaper in town with this kind of objectivity, I think that now
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:06.120]   we're seeing a response to the fact that facts are devalued.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.320]   They're available widely.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:13.840]   The internet makes facts available to anyone who seeks them out.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.280]   But that makes them more valuable, you know?
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.880]   That means I think we're a more fact-based society today.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   Well, I disagree.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.920]   I think it means that the fact is everywhere.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.880]   So analysis and context is more important than facts.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   Oh, I see.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.880]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.200]   So the factual matter, which is what the supposedly the objective reporter gives you is, here's
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.840]   the facts you decide.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:37.600]   That's gone because we can all get the facts.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.520]   Now it's really a matter of how do we understand this?
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.520]   What does it mean?
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.520]   What's the context?
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.120]   It's like shows like this, which really are, we do know reporting on this show.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120]   Oh no.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   It's all analysis.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.000]   But that's valuable, isn't it?
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   I run it.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.720]   The money is analysis, analysis, analysis.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.000]   Balmer used to say that.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.720]   Ironically, this is what Google search deals with algorithmically.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   Right.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.120]   You know, you search for something that has a million hits and they give you the first
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.120]   ten.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.400]   It's taken the place of the independent newspaper.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.120]   The algorithm is supposedly independent.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   Exactly.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.560]   Because the million unsorted is just completely useless.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.920]   Here's the other way I look at it.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.200]   Do you know, do you all know Ushahidi?
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.400]   It's a wonderful platform that enables people in an Nigerian election or in a Washington
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.960]   blizzard or in Haiti to use a map and put up points of data about what's happening.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.680]   It's crowd sourced information.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.680]   It really is.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.680]   And I consider that journalism.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.200]   I consider that the future of journalism creating a platform where the community can
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.960]   share its own information.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.480]   Now others say no, it's not because it doesn't have a story, it doesn't have the analysis,
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480]   it doesn't have this, it doesn't have that.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.480]   And I think the opposite.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.520]   I think this is how journalism has to think is in creating platforms.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.760]   And we in technology and entrepreneurship, that's where the world goes.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.200]   It's not about control anymore.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   It's about enablement.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.160]   Well, and Tim O'Reilly would say, "platform is everything.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.960]   Government should be a platform."
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:04.640]   It's all a platform for us to use then in a kind of democratic fashion.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.920]   The one thing that's missing from all of that, if for Portage is just the ability to
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.600]   sift through facts and come up with a series of facts through something like Google abrythmically.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.200]   Who does investigative reporting?
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.200]   Who digs?
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.360]   Who presses?
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.160]   Is there no one to do that anymore?
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.160]   Is that gone?
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.400]   Well, it still has value.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.600]   And it still has brand value.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.600]   Let's have a weekly.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.600]   Let's have a weekly.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.600]   Let's have a weekly.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.240]   The weeklies do it, the papers do it, the times does it.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.120]   There's a lot of independents trying to work their way up.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.040]   It's not like there's a shortage of people cranking stuff out.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.680]   And there's all these new things starting and up and they're trying to make a name for
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.440]   themselves from the beast I would include and the daily or whatever the heck that means.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.000]   So we shouldn't really worry about that.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.360]   I'm not worried about it.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.720]   Jeffrey, you worried about it?
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.400]   No, I think where the future comes is that's why I teach entrepreneurial journalism.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.560]   I think the journalists have to make their own jobs.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.200]   They've got to figure out how to be sustainable.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.520]   When I questioned the future of journalism, one of our former students came into my blog
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.400]   post and got mad at me and said, "What is your journalism school stand for then?"
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.240]   Well, it should stand for asking questions.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.120]   It should stand for breaking the old assumptions, I think.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.760]   LWP and the chat rooms asked the modern equivalent of how is Babby formed.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.600]   How is facts formed?
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.280]   Where do they come from?
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.760]   Who determines what is a fact?
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.760]   Is it Google?
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:21.760]   No, it's Wiki.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.720]   The Wikipedia, that book of knowledge.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.440]   That's actually one of the big scary things about the internet universe, which is that
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.400]   used to be there was a shared set of facts in a society.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.400]   It still is.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   And it all came through the...
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   The book of knowledge.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.160]   Well, I think we're getting to a point where everybody's got their own sets of facts, certainly
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.160]   in politics.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160]   That's scary.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.160]   And you look at the political discourse in the United States right now.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160]   Yeah, that's scary.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.440]   And it's one group with one set of facts and another group.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.760]   There's no...
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.120]   Are we in a world of situational facts?
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.040]   Like we had situational ethics, now we have situational facts.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040]   Well, that's a good thing.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040]   Where there's no such thing as a fact.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   Hear that one, Jeff?
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]   That's when we can steal.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.960]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:08.360]   Because traditionally we think of facts as facts.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.720]   You know, it's the only effort.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.520]   When I worked on the midnight shift, there was a guy named Billy Garrett who worked the
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.520]   best.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.520]   Immusible, not inevitable.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.440]   The phone would ring and somebody would say, "Billy, we got on the phone," and they'd
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.680]   say, "We're having a debate in a bar."
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.680]   I bet.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680]   What's this?
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.080]   And Garrett's rule was always give them an answer, preferably the wrong one.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.800]   Because he imagined that as soon as the phone hung up, in the next morning they had a huge
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.680]   bar brawl and he caused it and he giggled at it.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.600]   How did you find out facts in the old days?
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.600]   It goes back to your...
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.600]   Go to the library.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.400]   Yeah, who did?
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.000]   Or you'd call the newspaper.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   You'd call around.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.520]   So now we have an expectation of facts within 0.3 seconds.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.400]   I think that's a better society.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400]   I agree.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.400]   You think the old one is better?
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   Then the new one?
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400]   Don't.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   You like it.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.960]   You know what's better about today's society is Wikipedia.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.880]   Here's an example of a site that is trying to have a unified...
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.000]   The Book of Knowledge.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   Why do you say that?
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   That's what it should be called.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   The Book of Knowledge.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.240]   Well, I think it should be called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.080]   And you know the great thing about Wikipedia, not the interrupt.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   Nobody agrees with it.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.080]   He's just trying to be contrarian.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.080]   Me?
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.120]   So the thing that gets me about the Book of Knowledge is that you go to Wikipedia and
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.120]   you look something...
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.760]   You'll find like if some guy just got shot and you look him up...
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.760]   It's there.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.560]   There are certain people that have decided to dog the topic.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.040]   And in fact, one thing people don't realize is that if you go to some people's page and
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.240]   they have a topic dog and you go and change a bunch of things, the guy gets an RSS feed
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.920]   immediately saying this has been changed on your page and the guy goes back and switches
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.920]   the back.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   Sometimes I think they shot him.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920]   Just to be fair.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.920]   I mean it's amazing.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920]   You literally...
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920]   You never thought of that.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.600]   It's a news idea for a novel.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.920]   They beat like even Twitter.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.920]   It's really good news.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.920]   It's very good on Wikipedia.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.920]   It's amazing.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.480]   I think ultimately Wikipedia is the single success of the Internet, to be honest.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.640]   The rest of it, but it's like Godwin's Law.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.080]   It always comes down to the Wikipedia.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.240]   It's the only thing we can point to with any certain needs.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.240]   Say, "Look, see, it works."
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.400]   Well, free porn and free porn.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   And search.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.040]   That's a broken business model now.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.040]   Free porn?
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.760]   Well, we're not talking about a business model.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.200]   We're talking about what's successful.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.760]   There's no business model in free porn, I don't think.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.760]   No.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.760]   I'm sure there is.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.000]   It's just the exhibition is going crazy.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   I'm sure with the PDF...
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   Everyone has a contract that you porn.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   I'd love to do that story.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.840]   You run into a bunch of it.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.400]   There is a YouTube report.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.800]   Millions of people.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.800]   There is a YouTube report.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   Absolutely.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.040]   I mean, if anyone has a contract, they'd love to do the story about the economics of it.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.040]   Do they have ads?
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.040]   Of course they have ads.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.040]   Of course they have ads.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.040]   It's called porn too.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.040]   You don't want to go...
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.040]   Sorry, I don't know what's wrong.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.040]   Somebody in the chat...
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.280]   I have to tell you, I have to be able in the chat room and we'll know the name of it.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.520]   I can't get there right now because it's down because everybody went there.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.520]   Seriously.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.520]   No, no, no, no.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.520]   There's no way that you point in.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.520]   There you go.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.000]   There's only going to show you ads.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.440]   You see there's ads.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440]   But no.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440]   Okay.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.440]   So yeah, there are economics there.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.600]   It looks like a lot of hard work.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.920]   They also have tens and tens of millions of videos every day.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.600]   So there's got to be two economics there.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.600]   Show is not supposed to be posted.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.600]   You know, I actually...
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.600]   We all were about to lose his clean, g-n image.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.600]   There he goes.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.600]   I actually...
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.600]   I thought it was down.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.920]   Side note to the Twitter team.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.720]   There will be a little editing on this show.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.720]   I often vote.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.720]   I think it's down.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.320]   I think it was going down when you opened it.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   It was totally down for a long time.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   Let's take a break, shall we?
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.120]   Glad I brought it up.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.440]   Nobody's going to want to sponsor this segment.
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.440]   True.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.160]   I should really not do anything.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.640]   Tom Merritt is not here.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:47.320]   Not only would he at this time save me by doing the week ahead, but Tom's actually at Dragoncon
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.480]   where we've got a TNT that they recorded yesterday.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.480]   That'll be on Monday, right?
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:56.120]   That'll be Monday and tonight, I guess we're going to show some NSFW from Dragoncon.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.360]   Dragoncon, the big sci-fi convention.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   Where is it?
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.360]   And Tom Merritt is there.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.360]   It's in Atlanta.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:05.800]   Tom's with Veronica, Brian Brushwood, and Justin Robert Young.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.800]   They're out there.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   So that's cool.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.800]   Jonathan Colton's out there.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.800]   Joe Colton.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.800]   He's got a new album.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   That's why.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.480]   Let's talk about Google+ in a little bit because Mike Elgin has some things to say about that.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:22.640]   And then we've got some throwaway stories like Facebook Date Forces Woman to be Getaway
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   Driver.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   Now, that's...
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.640]   There you go.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.640]   That's a great story.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.640]   That's cool.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.640]   I throw those in for you.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.640]   I love them.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   Stay tuned.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640]   That's coming up next.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   But first, a word from audible.com.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:43.000]   Yes, we do have a sponsor for this segment and it's the best darn bookstore on the Internet.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   Owned by Amazon.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.760]   You know, one of the things they've done with the Kindle and I'm sure the new Kindle will
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:52.560]   do this too is when you go to your Kindle books on the Kindle, it also shows all your
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.560]   audible books.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.560]   Now, I've been an Audible member for more than 10 years, so I have 500 plus great audio
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.600]   books in my Audible list and the library.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.600]   Now, the nice thing about this is any book you've ever bought from Audible is available
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.120]   to you forever.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:10.520]   So it's like a real bookshelf where you can go back and say, "Oh man, I haven't read that
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.520]   book in ages.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.320]   Let's read it again."
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.280]   25,000 titles.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.120]   Fiction, nonfiction, history.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.880]   If you like science fiction, they've done such a great job.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:26.120]   They've got a whole Audible Frontiers program to record.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:31.560]   They've nine studios in the Audible headquarters now to record audio books of classics in science
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.560]   fiction that nobody ever recorded because there was no money to be made.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.560]   Great Robert Heinlein books and Isaac Asimov books.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.200]   Of course, if you're into the Game of Thrones, they've got that.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.920]   In fact, I highly recommend it before next season.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.840]   You've got to read Clash of Kings because you've got to read these before they go on
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.840]   TV, in my opinion.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.960]   If you're a true blood fan, they've got the Sookie Stackhouse novels.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.960]   It's all there.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.840]   I just was at the Dexter set on Friday.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.840]   That was so much fun.
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.760]   Of course, Dexter's based on a classic book.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.680]   You can get all the Dexter stories by Jeff Lindsay on Audible.com.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.960]   So if you're a fan of the Dexter TV show, read the books.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.040]   You'll love them.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.760]   I think Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the first one was the one they based the series on.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.400]   Audible is just a great resource.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.680]   Here's the deal.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:25.200]   Maybe life is busy nowadays in the 21st century where it's hard to find time to read.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:31.280]   But we all spend time when we would read if we could in the gym, in the car, on our commute,
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.760]   washing dishes, cleaning, there's lots of stuff where if you had it, you could listen to it.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.080]   That's where this is so great for me.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.240]   I get reading done hours a day that I wouldn't get otherwise.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.800]   It plays in all your portable devices, all the i devices, zoom, the Kindle, even many GPS
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.800]   devices.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.440]   If you've seen the movie The Help, the book is even better.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.000]   You got it.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.360]   You got to get it.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.360]   Audible.com.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.360]   Now here's the deal.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.840]   If you go to Audible.com/Twit2, you're going to get two, not one, but two books to listen
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.840]   to.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.480]   Go to Audible.com/BrowseAround, all these amazing books.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.480]   I'm reading right now.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.560]   I'm a big David McCullough fan.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:17.300]   I am reading his latest, which is a really fantastic book about Americans who went to
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:21.480]   Paris in the 1830s and '40s.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:27.920]   There was an exodus because Paris was the seat of culture when America was still an
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.080]   upstart nation.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.680]   This is such a wonderful book, The Greater Journey, Americans in Paris.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.800]   If you love Paris, I'm going back to Paris.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.560]   For the web in December.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.320]   So I love reading about Paris, especially Paris in the 1830s.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.720]   The Louvre was already a museum by the 1830s.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.720]   You don't say.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:45.720]   You heard it.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.720]   You heard it.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.920]   I guess they threw the king out of the palace.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.920]   They had to do something.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.920]   Hey, we'll put some.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.200]   Well, I didn't know this, but Louis Philippe was a collector of great paintings.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.200]   He bought the Mona Lisa.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.600]   Many other paintings have brought them to the Louvre.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:04.600]   Even then, they talk about the great painting that was painted of the Louvre by the American
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.600]   painter.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.360]   And the name has gone out of my head now.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.600]   But it's just a wonderful story.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.920]   I'm not a thing of Hawthorne.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.920]   Not Oliver Wendell Holmes.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.920]   James Fennimore Cooper was there.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.160]   Ralph Waldo Emerson.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.960]   Just really amazing book.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:21.960]   But take your pick.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.200]   You get two of them.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.200]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.200]   You'll sign up for the platinum account.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.200]   That's two books a month.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.360]   You can cancel it anytime.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.200]   And the books will be yours to keep forever and ever.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.200]   Audible.com.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.200]   I spent two days recording.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.200]   Oh, you're kidding?
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.200]   It's a Pembroke 20-something.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   Yeah, I recorded it.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200]   In two days?
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.480]   You did the whole book in two days?
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.480]   I'm impressed.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.480]   I did.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.480]   I'm a poor editor.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   That poor, sucky editor.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.080]   I figured there's about 2,000 edits to make.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.080]   But that's great.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.080]   I've done this before.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.080]   You sit in the booth.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   They're on the other side.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.080]   The producer's there and the editor.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.240]   And he says, "Well, I'll stop Jeff.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.400]   Slow down a little bit."
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.680]   Or something like that.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.400]   And then you just start up again.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   So you can whip through it.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   Two days is pretty impressive.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.120]   Do they pay you separately for that?
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.640]   Is that a -- essentially hire you as a voice?
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   Or you just do it?
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.880]   Yeah, I got five grand for that.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.880]   They only offer me two.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.160]   You should have professional voice.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.160]   Really?
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.000]   You got five grand and you got two.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.720]   I got an email saying, "Hey, this is great.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.720]   We're going to give you $2,000."
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.520]   He signed the dummy contract.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.520]   Well, I actually didn't do it.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520]   I said, "I'm too busy."
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.760]   I wish I could have.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.120]   I really love reading out loud.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.120]   Was it fun?
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.120]   Was it a good experience, Jeff?
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.120]   Yeah, it's nerve-wracking.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.120]   It's hard.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:37.120]   You know, because it's one matter when the life is going by and you've got life and it's
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.520]   happening and the show keeps going and we muff up.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.040]   But when you're trying to read it, right, it's the way I talk, which is really possible
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:47.120]   to learn and listen to it because every time nobody understands what I say, it's really
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.120]   fun.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.120]   You have to slow down.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.120]   Well, good.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.920]   Well, public parts come out at the end of the month and we'll be able to get the audiobook
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.920]   at the same time.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.920]   That's great.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:55.920]   Sorry.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:56.920]   Two plugs.
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:57.920]   Only two plugs.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:58.920]   No, I'm thrilled to do it.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:21:59.920]   I can't wait to read your book.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.520]   Because Cedric is looking at Audible.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.520]   He says the Woody Allen Connect collection, which is-
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.520]   Well, thanks to you.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.200]   I've been a subscriber for three, four, five years.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.920]   Audible France, which is a little different, right?
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.920]   No, no, no, no.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:10.920]   I took the US version.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.320]   All I listened to are US books anyway.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.960]   That's why your English is so good.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.720]   That's why his English is so good.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.080]   There are other factors as well.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.440]   But yes, and I love the Woody Allen collection.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.440]   It's so great.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.400]   And he reads 12 hours of Woody Allen reading to you, which is really super cool.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.680]   Talking like Woody Allen.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.080]   He's really playing out the books.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.280]   So it's really very enjoyable.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.280]   Yeah, they're so good.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.080]   Steve Martin does a great job with his books Born Standing Up.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.080]   I just-
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.840]   There are some authors who should read their books like Jeff Jarvis.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.200]   And when they're good, they're really good.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.200]   Audible-
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.200]   I don't know if I want to hear Dick Cheney reading his book.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.200]   And my time.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.880]   A personal and political novel.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:53.480]   He actually doesn't narrate part of it, but Edward Herman takes the rest of it.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:57.040]   Audible.com/twit to give it a shot.
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.320]   I think you will love it.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.320]   I'm glad to hear that.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.320]   So you became a little listener because of two-
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.880]   I'm not sure I listened to two books a month.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.880]   So I have a sort of a backlog of books to go through.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880]   That's what I do.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.880]   I can't get through two a month.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.120]   I get one a month, but I figure what I'm doing is saving up for my old age.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.160]   You know Paris to San Francisco, all Paris to Tokyo, which are the slides that we mostly
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.360]   do are still 11 to 12 hours.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360]   So that's a lot of reading.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.160]   You did you train a lot?
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.880]   Yeah, two, three, four times a year.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880]   For Planet Crayon?
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.880]   Also on holiday.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:33.160]   I'm going, I just signed up to go on the next Macmania cruise, Macmania 15, November of next
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.160]   year to Australia.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.960]   Oh, that's a long flight to Sydney.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.600]   So I'll need some Audible books for that.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.600]   That's going to be fun.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.440]   Two weeks, we're going to the Great Barrier Reef.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.120]   There's a total eclipse of the sun.
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.560]   You want to make it down to Antarctica?
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.560]   Don't.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.560]   That's painful.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:52.000]   The only question is why would you spend your time talking Macintosh during being there?
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   Well, because the Great Barrier Reef--
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   Does it pay the way?
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   Ooh.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.640]   No, what's nice is you only do courses when you're at sea.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.280]   So when you're at the Great Barrier Reef, you don't have to teach any courses.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.000]   Not only-- I'll do four or five courses, probably.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.800]   It's a two-week cruise.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.280]   If you want to know more about it, InsightCruises.com, it's Australia.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.160]   So I'm really glad because I'm going to get to see the solar eclipse, which is fun.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.160]   That's going to be awesome.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   Scientific American kind of jointly sponsors these.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.040]   We're going to Sydney, Newcastle, Brisbane, Hamilton Island.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:27.800]   The eclipse is at sea and then a couple of places in New Caledonia, including Iliad de
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:32.600]   Pa, which is apparently a white sand paradise.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.600]   That's cool.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.600]   I can't wait.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.280]   I can't wait.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.400]   So, Macmania 15, if you want to know more about that.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   All right.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.400]   That's enough plugs for me.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.400]   I brought out--
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.400]   I see you brought your 10-inch cock.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.400]   Oh, God.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:48.320]   You know, I had a better line than that.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.320]   No, you did.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.320]   Yes, I did.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.320]   I'm not going to do it now.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   You're going to have to step it all up.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.320]   Come on.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:57.360]   And it's a 14-inch or any way.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.680]   The only reason I say that that's from Chad's desk, Chad Johnson, one of our employees.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.840]   Who gave me permission to bring it out?
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:04.840]   And he has an empty desk.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.840]   To pull it out.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.840]   Except for that rooster.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:12.440]   Well, I probably should say that for those listening on audio, that is in fact a stuffed
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440]   rooster.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.440]   They're probably wondering.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.840]   I don't think it's a real rooster.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.840]   I think there's a bunch of feathers around some sort of paper machine.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:23.680]   You've seen the bad-- I saw this on Google+-- the bad taxidermy site.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.160]   No, it sounds like a winner though.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.640]   Oh, my God.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.640]   Is it funny?
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.760]   I think it's crappytaxidermy.com.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.080]   And it just shows you that there's actually skill involved.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.720]   Which some people do not possess.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.520]   In stuffing animals.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520]   Some of this stuff is so bad.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520]   Oh, no.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:48.360]   And some of these animals just-- is that a real panda?
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.360]   Yeah, probably.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.360]   This is--
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:56.280]   I think everyone should have their cat stuffed.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.760]   Did you ever ever stuff a pet?
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.000]   Oh, the audience is just not enjoying this site.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   They're groaning.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   Yeah, groaning.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   Sorry.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   There's children present.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.960]   Please, John.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:12.960]   Story number four.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.280]   Google+, John C. Devorek, has now gone on record.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.440]   Of course he did it off, Mike.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:18.440]   But C will do it on, Mike.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.440]   I did it before.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.440]   I've actually done it on this show.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.960]   Saying it has no future whatsoever.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   Right.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.960]   Or cut two.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   Or cut two.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.520]   That's saying a lot.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.800]   Meanwhile, Mike and I love it.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.000]   Yeah, good for you.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   I love it.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.080]   I went on something that I called the Google+ diet.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.320]   And the reason was self-preservation.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.000]   I was on so many social networks.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.760]   And I had a blog and a newsletter and all these different things.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.200]   And I wrote a column saying, oh, Google+ is so flexible.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   You can do everything on Google+.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.200]   Right.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.840]   And then after I wrote the column, I thought, well, if it's so great, why aren't I doing
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:51.840]   it?
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:52.840]   Why?
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.840]   So I did it.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.840]   So I did it.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.840]   I ate my own dog food.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:57.840]   And now everything comes out of my Google+ account.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.320]   My newsletter is actually automatically produced.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.320]   Really?
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.320]   Really?
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.880]   I'm using MailChimp and RSS.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.160]   And it just goes out by itself.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160]   I don't touch anything.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.160]   That's very cool.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.160]   I have a weekly and a daily version.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.160]   I could do an hourly version.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.160]   Just because a Google+?
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   Google+ goes straight out.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.840]   I don't know why you're using it as some sort of content management system, which is
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.320]   not what social networks are for.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:20.680]   The best part is I don't use Twitter, Facebook, Quora, any of these other services.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.680]   None of them.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.680]   I just use one-- and I used to have my content spread out all over.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.160]   And everybody thought I was just one part of the elephant.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.680]   Now I'm putting the whole elephant in one place.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.400]   And it's like, wow, this is a lot of stuff.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.240]   So it's really working for me.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.080]   And I think it's going to be around for a long time.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.080]   I do too.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080]   I really like it.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.560]   And I see some people like Mike, like Trey Rakcliffe, using it so effectively that I really
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:46.120]   think that there is something going on here, that this is more than just a blogging platform
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.480]   or a social platform.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.240]   When you get engagement on Google+, it completely dwarfs everything else.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.200]   You've been doing this on other platforms.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.840]   I'm sure you agree that you're getting much more engagement there than anywhere else.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.120]   In terms of the implementation of everything, it's fantastic.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.520]   The only problem with it is that mom and grandma and cousin--
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.400]   I know I can't get any of my families to use this.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.840]   They have no interest.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.520]   So it's more Twitter than Facebook right now.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.080]   The family element and all that stuff.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:14.880]   Oh, there you go.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.560]   I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.160]   It's not a Facebook killer.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:19.680]   It's its own thing.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:20.880]   Well, I agree with you on that.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.640]   In a way, you're using, like I said, as a CMS.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.040]   But I don't think it's a Facebook killer.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.560]   But I do think it is on its own.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560]   Something of great stuff.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.040]   It'll be a Twitter--
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:28.960]   It'll be a Twitter card.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.960]   It was very popular in Brazil.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.680]   Well, yeah.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.840]   It's like the Brazilian--
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.400]   Well, I thought--
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:33.400]   I thought--
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.640]   --it was about four years ago how no one got Facebook.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:38.840]   Except for students and maybe you and me.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.240]   Now even my mom is on Facebook.
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.240]   It'll be in a--
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.040]   My mom might be in a--
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.160]   Google+ will be inescapable because Google
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.640]   is going to put it everywhere.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:49.400]   I mean, it's just you're not going to be able to turn around
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:49.400]   and--
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:49.920]   Turn around and--
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.520]   Google wave?
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.240]   What was it?
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   No, no, no, no.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.840]   The great strength of Google+ is that, for example,
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.480]   even if I'm inside Gmail or a Google Doc,
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.920]   I still get notifications.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.000]   I can look at what people have just posted.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.480]   I can even reply or add a friend
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.520]   whilst never leaving my Google Doc to do all the email
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.480]   I was typing.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.080]   This is so immensely powerful.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.000]   And the fact that you can link to a post,
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.680]   that these posts are going to go way up into such results,
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.560]   I mean, we've only seen the beginning of it.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.680]   It's not even public yet.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.760]   Not everyone can really sign up.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.960]   Well, in fact, lots of different groups are banned
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.120]   from Google+ right now.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:26.320]   There's--
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.120]   Brands.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.040]   Brands companies.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:31.040]   Brands-- people between 13 and 18, I think it is.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.400]   People with strange names.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.040]   If your name is--
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.160]   I'm going to the nimmest people.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:34.720]   Exactly.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.680]   Well, even people with whose real names are a little odd.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.280]   Do they end up getting blocked?
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.840]   They get-- well, right now--
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.000]   Because this is because of the real name policy.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.640]   If you're Lady Gaga, you're fine.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.760]   Exactly.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.120]   And there are people with very strange names
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:49.920]   who are not famous.
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.960]   And they're just out of luck.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:54.920]   That just violates-- there's a really interesting Australian
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:58.320]   podcast where both the podcaster and his guest
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.880]   have names-- real names that violate their policies.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.400]   And neither of them are on Google+.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.760]   So how is that a good thing?
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.320]   I'll tell you why it's a good thing.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.280]   It's not a good thing for them.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.280]   It's a terrible thing for them.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.480]   Well, then how is that a good thing?
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.080]   Because it does mean that the people who are on Google--
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.080]   now, this is a conversation we've had on Twig a lot, Jim.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:13.960]   So chime in.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:17.000]   But it does mean that the people who are on Google+
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.440]   are real people.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.640]   And it raises the level of discourse.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.680]   Well, I guess it lies.
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.240]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:22.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:23.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:25.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:29.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:30.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:31.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:33.920]   He doesn't even look at this.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:40.680]   The solution doesn't exist.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.600]   Oh, I like a foreign sight.
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.480]   But then you get to use a pseudonym.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.960]   And you inform other people that it's a pseudonym.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.320]   So when I go to follow somebody, it's like, oh, here's John
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.240]   whatever.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.520]   And it's a pseudonym.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.360]   So I can choose--
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.840]   OK, I don't want any pseudonym people.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:58.760]   So I'm not going to follow.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.120]   Or maybe I don't care.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.960]   So that's interesting if they had a switch that said,
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:06.000]   do not show me people whose names are not their actual names.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.040]   And I got to choose.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.120]   I probably would do that to be honest with you.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.000]   All of the benefit--
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:10.000]   No, no.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.200]   All of the major advantages.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.520]   I would be the point.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.480]   Because I don't like the trolls who poses somebody not real.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:19.520]   I'm finding the quality of discourse on Google+,
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:23.040]   I compared a post I put on both my blog and Google+,
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.800]   and I got to say it's not always the case posted today
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:27.960]   had good discourse.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:31.680]   But Google+ generally has better discourse.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.360]   Part of the disadvantage of Google+ is it's not lasting.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.160]   It's very fleeting.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:35.760]   It goes away.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:38.960]   You can't really search it, which is ironic.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.560]   So I don't know why.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.080]   That is ironic.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.320]   Well, I'm sure they'll fix that.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:43.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:44.320]   They will.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:45.880]   Unfortunately.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:46.280]   Why?
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.080]   You don't like that.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.680]   Well, I think, again, I think that should be a matter of choice.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:53.960]   But I forgot who it is that is really driving this idea.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:56.920]   But you need to be able to forget stuff eventually.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:00.280]   I mean, this thing about keeping on to everything you say--
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   I kind of agree with you.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.280]   I mean, I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.880]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:06.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.880]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.320]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.920]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.920]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.520]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.760]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.160]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:26.360]   I think it's a very interesting thing.
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:33.360]   All right, John, what do you most hate about it?
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.360]   What do you think about Twitter when you first saw it?
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.360]   I like Twitter.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.360]   I got on Twitter really early.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.360]   Did you?
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.360]   Well, I mean, the first time I saw it, it was another piece of--
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.360]   You mocked him.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.360]   I always mocked you so well.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.360]   You mocked him really.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.360]   So I don't think it's a social network.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:51.360]   It doesn't function as a social network with all the kind of crazy elements of the unfriending
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.360]   and creating an actual social structure.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.360]   It's just basically like you said.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.360]   That's where we like it.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.360]   You like it?
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.360]   Yeah, that's where you like it because you don't want to get involved in anything that's
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:04.560]   actually social because you don't even answer your email for God's sake.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.120]   So I think it doesn't work as a social network.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:09.760]   I think it works for what these guys are using it for.
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:10.760]   Sure.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:15.320]   And it's like Twitter has a certain value, but it's not a social network in the sense
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.520]   that Facebook is.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.520]   Facebook is an actual force of nature.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.520]   Do you use Facebook a lot?
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.520]   Do you like Facebook?
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.520]   I don't use Facebook at all.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.280]   But the thing is that I've posted things on both Google--
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.280]   I don't want to be in a social network.
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.280]   Why would I use Facebook?
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   I think nobody-- I'd be honest with you.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.840]   I think most people don't like.
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.480]   Even people who like Facebook don't like Facebook.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.880]   Facebook is one of those things you ask people, they go, "Eh, I really don't like it."
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.880]   My wife loves Facebook.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.680]   Really, like just says, "I love Facebook."
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:41.680]   Yep.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.680]   How about here in the audience?
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:43.680]   Come on, be honest.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:44.680]   You love Facebook.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.680]   Say yes.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.480]   There's one guy he does that the female does.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:48.480]   Oh, you use it a lot.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.480]   Women love Facebook.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.760]   No, no, I'm not saying she does.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.880]   I'm not saying they don't use it a lot, but you kind of as a love-hate thing, right?
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.280]   It's the only thing out there.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.120]   It's the only thing out there.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.640]   So you use it because you get value out of it, but it's not what you want.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:01.640]   It's not exactly right.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:02.640]   You know that.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.640]   By default.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.560]   You use it by default.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.480]   But correct me if I'm wrong, the value of Facebook is that everybody's there.
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.280]   Everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:11.680]   You have to use it.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:12.680]   Exactly.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.680]   So I think eventually--
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:16.480]   Already we're seeing the boy girl ratio on Google+--
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.280]   Oh, it's terrible.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.680]   It's almost 80% men.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.720]   Yeah, and that's telling you what.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.720]   That is not social.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:26.720]   Or if any social women would use it?
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.520]   Well, that might be bad.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.720]   No, I'll bring you that.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.960]   Women are more social than men.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.080]   In general, I'll grant you that.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.440]   According to social statistics--
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.680]   Somebody says it's funny.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.320]   According to socialstatistics.com, the ratio is 86% men.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:42.320]   There you go.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.480]   To 12% women to 1% other.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:47.320]   And here you go.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:50.160]   I think the other is giant cocks and furries.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.960]   You said it.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.440]   God, I'm going to have to edit this show.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.400]   You're going to have to really go post on this one.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:56.400]   We're taking those.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.400]   We're taking those.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:58.400]   We're taking those.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.400]   Are you ready?
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.400]   It's going to get shorter all the time.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.360]   It's taking quite a few notes.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.920]   I agree, John, that Google+ is a mystery at this point to me.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.960]   I don't know what the prognosis is.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.400]   I think it's very interesting.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.880]   And I think it's encouraging that Google, who
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.120]   has had a series of bad failures like wave and buzz,
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.640]   actually could learn something from those
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.640]   and do something that at least works for now.
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.560]   Well, I'm going to talk to Mike after the show
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.960]   and find out what his automated system is
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.320]   that he can do these news layers.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.240]   There's no API, but there is RSS.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.240]   There's RSS.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.400]   There's putting some together.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.560]   We'll talk about it later.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.440]   And I'll do a report, sell for 99 cents
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.800]   via the Jarvis methodology.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.760]   And what is the story on Twitter?
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:39.080]   What is the future of Twitter?
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:41.640]   I think it's still like the pulse of the internet.
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.160]   It's so fast to go through.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.440]   It is live.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.520]   It is time-based.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.240]   You see things in a chronological order,
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:50.120]   which is not the case on Google,
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.200]   on Google+, where you see stuff depending
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.480]   on the number of comments, the likes, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.320]   So I mean, for following things live,
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.680]   Twitter is still the best.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:01.520]   Twitter is where people knew that you were on your porn.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:04.040]   But I'm not sure people on Google+ realize that.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.280]   But here's what people--
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.160]   Which is a good thing.
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.000]   Need to realize--
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000]   It's on YouTube already.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.280]   --is no reason to use Twitter.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.360]   Because if you use Google+ and then hook in Twitter to Google+,
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.120]   then everything you post on Google+
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.360]   instantly shows up on Twitter.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.320]   I think Twitter is going to become an empty shell
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.080]   where everything is just--
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.080]   I think it already is.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.080]   I think it already is.
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:21.640]   Kind of like Buzz was.
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.160]   I kill anybody's account on Twitter
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.440]   that I'm following who reposts four square or something
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.760]   that says all these secondary things.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.760]   If I had only posted on your ships--
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.800]   If I wanted somebody to follow somebody on four square,
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:37.600]   I joined four square and followed them.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.200]   But it's an awesome thing to do.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.480]   Because when you post something on Google+,
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.000]   can I say something extremely controversial?
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.080]   I think Twitter has become a little bit more urban.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.920]   It is no longer the geeks.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:53.360]   If you look at-- these are the trending topics US-wide right
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.480]   now on Twitter except the promoted one, which is a geek story.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.320]   Team Bieber is a beast.
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320]   Happy birthday Beyonce.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.880]   Daddy's little girls.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.720]   Dirty Bieber secrets.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:08.160]   I really hate when and stop bragging about it has become--
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.800]   It's almost a celebrity culture.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:10.840]   I mean, these were--
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.240]   Yeah, it's trash.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.880]   Yeah, this has become the TMZ of social media.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.320]   Yeah, but social media.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:17.560]   You don't have to follow those people or those trends.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.240]   You can have your own little group.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.040]   And you can use them for whatever reason you want.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.640]   I use it for feedback with readers.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.600]   And I also use it for crowdsourcing.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:25.720]   It works fine.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.480]   I haven't even visited it in months.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.800]   You hate it from the Google+?
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.280]   You're from the Google+.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:30.360]   They took the name Twitter.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.680]   Google+ is so much better for crowdsourcing.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:33.320]   It's not even--
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:33.800]   I agree.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:34.800]   --it's not even close.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.280]   And the great thing is if you hook in Twitter via Google+,
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.640]   then that link takes you to the Google+,
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:42.280]   back to Google+, where you can have a real conversation.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.000]   Do a paper on this and sell it for $0.99
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.320]   via the Jeff Jarvis.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.600]   But you can't have a conversation on Twitter.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.800]   But Mike, how do you have a conversation?
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.000]   I don't want a conversation.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:50.480]   I disagree.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:50.980]   I agree.
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:51.480]   This is great.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:51.980]   This is great.
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:56.320]   During Irene, our overdone storm here on the East Coast--
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.760]   and I don't mean that because it was a tragedy,
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.240]   but it was overdone on cable TV.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.440]   But during Irene, I found that no one was
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.840]   discussing it on Google+.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.280]   And it's not-- you can't gather around a hashtag.
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.440]   You can't gather around a search topic,
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.640]   whereas to discuss an ongoing news story like that
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:13.280]   as it was occurring, or the East Coast earthquake, which
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.600]   we really overdid.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.520]   But Twitter was the place for that.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:19.000]   For that kind of news, and for earthquakes, things like that,
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.320]   I mean, Twitter is--
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.120]   it's just like you get it instantly.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.120]   It's awesome for that.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.480]   But I think that the minority of information out there
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.760]   is natural disasters and things like that
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:30.120]   are the really real time-breaking stories.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.840]   I just think that it's--
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.160]   John mentioned crowdsourcing.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.800]   Google+, I post something on Google+, I get--
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:37.320]   Oh, yeah, I agree with you there.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:37.800]   Really?
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.600]   I'm not knocking it.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.120]   I like Google+, I like them both.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:43.000]   I think they're for different things.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000]   And I use them all.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.120]   OK.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.280]   All right, whatever.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.240]   Did we beat that one?
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.320]   I think I really want to talk about the Facebook date
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.800]   that turned so bad.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.320]   Oh, that's the story of the day.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.240]   And we'll wrap up with that.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:57.760]   What do you say?
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:01.480]   What about the story about, apparently,
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.240]   Eric Schmidt quit the Apple board,
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:04.760]   because he couldn't stand being on it?
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.440]   No, no, no, no.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:05.960]   I was there.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:06.920]   He didn't say that.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:09.160]   He was talking to Mark Benyoff at Dreamforce.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.840]   They had sort of a fireside chat.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:14.200]   And someone at Bloomberg thought he heard, Eric Schmidt said,
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:17.800]   I stayed on the Apple board until I couldn't stand the board
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:18.240]   anymore.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:18.840]   Wow.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:22.280]   No, what he really said was until I couldn't stay on the board
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:24.480]   anymore, meaning when Google+--
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.880]   Because you couldn't get a lot of traffic.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:26.960]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.360]   And it felt weird, because Schmidt just said
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:33.320]   that he thought that Steve Jobs had done the best jobs
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:38.560]   as a CEO of any CEO in the last 50 to 100 years.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:39.520]   It was a misunderstanding.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:40.160]   Absolutely.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.000]   I mean, look for it.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.680]   Alfred Sloan was pretty damn good at John--
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.800]   Look for it on YouTube.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:44.720]   Eric Schmidt was--
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.240]   --slown.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.080]   Come on.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.200]   I love you, John.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:49.720]   I don't know where the hell you come up with this crap.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:50.240]   The crap.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.360]   Alfred Sloan's probably the greatest CEO that ever lived.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.960]   The greatest CEO ever lived was Alfred B. Sloan.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.520]   Let's check it out.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.240]   I'm sure I've never heard of it.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.800]   I mean, I know his foundation.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.640]   I never heard of what he did.
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.560]   What did he do?
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.600]   He's the one who created General Motors
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.040]   from a bunch of little car companies
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.120]   who built the biggest corporation in the world.
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:11.520]   Oh, that's--
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.160]   Look how well that turned out.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.720]   Alfred Sloan's dead.
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.520]   No, look for the Eric Schmidt's speech on YouTube.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.200]   It's pretty interesting, especially
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.320]   when he talks economy and politics.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.680]   And basically, Mark Benjoff tries
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.960]   to get him to say stuff about Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer,
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.760]   Mark Zuckerberg, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.360]   And it's sometimes funny.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.800]   The guy can be funny.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.360]   Let's check it out.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.040]   Intentionally, I mean.
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.640]   According to the Economist, the esteemed economist,
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.760]   Alfred Sloan was not only arguably the most original CEO
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.400]   and organizational thinker of the 20th century,
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.280]   clever enough to set his record down
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:51.840]   in a book that has become a management classic,
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.840]   my years with General Motors.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.680]   You can get it on Audible.
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.600]   And before I ask you to do his management book for 99 cents.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:05.680]   Do you think better than Bill Gates Ford, Henry Ford--
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.040]   Oh, much better than Henry Ford, to sure.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.040]   Well, sure.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:11.160]   Oh, Welch is overrated, yeah.
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.920]   So here's how it works.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:24.120]   Well, Leah Gibbs from South Wales, which is in the UK.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.640]   She's 23 years old.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.920]   She met a guy named Adam Minton on Facebook
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.200]   and said, let's go out on a date.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.440]   She hoped they would spend their first date watching
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.120]   a DVD at Minton's house.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.040]   When Gibbs arrived, Minton told her he needed to see a friend
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.480]   and asked whether she might drive him to see, said friend.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.080]   Apparently, there was no friend in shed.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.240]   Instead, she drove him to an off-track betting shop
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:53.520]   where he threatened the staff with a kitchen knife
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.440]   and took off with a cash, leaping back into her car,
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:02.040]   telling her, go, go, go.
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.640]   Dream date.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:06.880]   This is why Facebook needs a don't like button.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:09.000]   She told the Daily Mail, I thought
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.200]   I would be ending the night in Adam's arms.
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:16.400]   Instead, he had landed in the long arms of the law.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.880]   I was facing jail.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.160]   It talks like that.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:21.680]   I know.
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:22.680]   Nobody does.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:23.680]   People in Wales.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.320]   In Wales, they talk like that.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:28.400]   Because no one.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.880]   It's a dumb story, and I'm sorry.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:30.840]   I love that story.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.280]   I love it.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:32.080]   It's a great story.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.080]   I just like the average report.
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:37.440]   And the moral of the story is that he talks the cops
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:40.440]   into letting her go and says that it was just their first date.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.720]   That's the charm.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.640]   I missed the bottom line there.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.120]   She turns out to be a charming date after all, a prince.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.680]   She should marry him once he's out of jail.
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:52.920]   And Mike Elgin says, the thing we learn so much from this story
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.640]   is--
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:55.120]   I don't know.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:55.720]   No idea.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.080]   No idea.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.440]   Be careful who you date on Facebook.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.000]   I think we've covered the cup real suing LoJack
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.760]   for spying on sex chat.
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:08.800]   Netflix is going to let stars walk away.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.000]   They don't have any choice.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.400]   Stars says in February, we're not going
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:12.800]   to offer our movies and Netflix anymore.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.800]   Please say it's only 8% of their content now.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.520]   Yeah, really?
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.000]   I don't know.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.240]   It's all the new stuff.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.440]   Meanwhile, Dish is apparently preparing a blockbuster.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.280]   They own blockbuster.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:22.880]   Branded it.
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.720]   Netflix streaming competitor.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:28.840]   This according to Gigome timing it well, considering
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.760]   the issues going on with Netflix.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:36.440]   Can there be more than one Netflix?
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.880]   I wish there were one in Europe.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.280]   Actually, Netflix is coming out in Europe, which is the big news.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.440]   I mean, as far as I could talk about--
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.440]   It would be amazing, wouldn't it?
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.080]   I don't know how you live with that Netflix.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:44.680]   Yeah, well--
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.400]   It's key.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:49.560]   I get the feeling that the Netflix thing was all about pricing.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.280]   And Netflix is kind of the hero here,
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.400]   because essentially, stars want to crank up the cost and the pricing.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:55.760]   Nine.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.600]   And they want to keep the cost of streaming movies down.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.880]   And that's great, because this is a repeat of the music industry,
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.120]   where the music industry just kept--
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:07.640]   But they must be under such pressure from not only the movie
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.480]   industry, but cable companies who really don't want you
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.960]   to be using their cheap bandwidth to be watching $7.99
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.840]   a month movies on Netflix, when you could
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.440]   be paying that much for one movie on their video on demand.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.440]   That's why I like the Devorak method of paying by the minute.
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:21.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.840]   That's where it should be.
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.480]   It's doable.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:27.880]   If you get that big old Dish--
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.480]   We have run out of time, but we actually haven't,
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.760]   but I've run out of stories.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.120]   Let's just call it a day.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:37.160]   It's got-- you can spend all this extra time posting out
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.040]   all this-- the filth that's in this show.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.320]   This is going to take us forever to edit it.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:41.800]   Thank God.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:42.840]   For your fault, John.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.760]   It's John's seat of the works fall.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.480]   No, he's been good today.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.760]   Very good.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.480]   Thank you for being here.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:49.240]   Neil, John.
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:51.240]   Flash the porn on deck.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:51.720]   No, I think we--
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.720]   That was the beginning of the end.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:53.400]   It was brief.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:57.400]   It wasn't as bad as our chat-rulate moment a few months ago.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.400]   We got the time.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.400]   Who's the idea was that?
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:44:59.760]   We'll block it out.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.440]   I don't think-- I think you should just blur it.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.480]   Don't block it, blur it.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:02.920]   Blur it.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:03.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.200]   I don't think we actually saw-- I think we saw.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:06.120]   I don't think we saw anything.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.920]   But I think people are going to take stills or whatever.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.480]   Well, I don't know.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.200]   I'd like to see those stills, so--
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:16.120]   I want to remind people that I'm at ChannelDevork.com
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.600]   and knowagendashow.org and devork.org/blog.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.680]   And see his bricks of their many of them.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.640]   I'm going to go see these bricks that you claim they're--
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.120]   You have fans.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.640]   You have many, many, many people, guys.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:29.800]   Like Mike Elgin, I'm so glad you came.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.880]   I've been such a fan for months, pleat and months, years.
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:35.400]   I just discovered the last--
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:36.400]   For days.
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:37.400]   For days.
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:38.400]   For days.
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:39.640]   I've for an hour or two.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.280]   Since Tuesday.
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.240]   Until recently.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:41.840]   You've set a fan.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.760]   It's all about Google+.
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:43.560]   No, no, I've been a fan.
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:44.800]   I got your newsletter.
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:47.040]   You did the great quirky stuff for a long time.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.640]   I'm just really glad we get you on the show.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:49.640]   I've been meaning to for ages.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.720]   I don't know what took me so long.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.320]   Thank you.
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.160]   Come back.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:52.840]   I would love to.
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.800]   Where should people go to find out more about you?
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:55.720]   Google+.
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.240]   That's where he lives now, baby.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.240]   No kidding.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:58.240]   No kidding.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.680]   And then search for me.
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:02.720]   And the newsletter's free, and it's really great to subscribe to.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:03.560]   But you know what?
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:07.080]   If you read Mike's stuff on Google+, you've read it all.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:12.880]   And elgan.com is the now defunct website.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.200]   Do you post anything there?
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:14.720]   No.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:15.720]   Nothing.
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:16.400]   It's defunct.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.640]   It's defunct.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.160]   It's the--
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:19.560]   It's kind of sad, isn't it, Mike?
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.600]   Yeah, shouldn't you have some sort of a forward or something?
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.240]   I've quadrupled my readers on Google.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.240]   Wow.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.720]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.160]   I hear more and more success stories from photographers, from bloggers.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:30.920]   It's incredible.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:33.000]   And you're writing a book called The Spartan Diet.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000]   That is correct.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.240]   Tell me about that, because I need that Spartan Diet.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:37.880]   With my wife, she's sitting in the audience there.
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:38.880]   Really?
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.440]   Yeah, she's an expert on food and health and so on.
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.440]   Well, that's exciting.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.360]   Is it like paleo or that kind of thing?
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:44.360]   It's--
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.360]   Am I going to have abs up steel?
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.360]   Yes, you are.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.360]   Ooh.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.360]   It's a step.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:49.360]   I like to see it.
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.360]   It's a step up from paleo.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.760]   It's like-- it's paleo, but with really delicious food.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.760]   And you brought chocolate?
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:54.760]   Is this a nasty paleo?
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.760]   No.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.760]   No.
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.760]   Yeah, so there's--
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.640]   I want to do The Spartan Diet.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:01.640]   I'm ready to do it.
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:02.640]   I will be a guinea pig.
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.640]   We will personally coach you.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:04.640]   Wow.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:05.640]   That sounds good.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.640]   There you have it.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:07.640]   No, seriously.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:08.640]   When's the book coming out?
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:09.640]   Uh, later this year.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:10.640]   Okay.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:11.640]   Come back.
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.640]   Okay.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.640]   We'll talk about it.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:14.640]   Wonderful.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.640]   And we could make this be like The Spartan Diet.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.640]   I will be your six-- I'll be before.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:19.480]   I can't promise after, but I'll definitely be before.
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:22.560]   Cedric-- Cedric and Grink came a long way to be here.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.560]   My pleasure.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.760]   I'm a lot of people from Switzerland, but you know, still.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:26.760]   You know.
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:27.760]   Still.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:28.760]   It was so nice to have you.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.760]   Planet Cran is on every week on T-S-I.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:31.760]   It's on every week.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:35.880]   It first runs on Saturdays at 1.10 PM, but I mean, you have to be French to understand
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:36.880]   what goes on in there.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.240]   So unfortunately I only do French stuff.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:40.200]   Do you think French technology is different?
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.080]   I mean, in France is a different thing.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.880]   All I cover is in the US and Asia.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:44.880]   It's our stories.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.600]   Yeah, basically they're the same stories.
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.940]   No, there are some very cool French startups, which I'll introduce you to when you come
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:52.560]   to Paris in December, full of web.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.520]   I'm very excited.
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:58.360]   If we don't plug in the web, you know, a little week is going to come after both of us.
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.800]   And I'm also on a weekly podcast, a weekly Mac podcast called Orfele Mac, which we can
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.960]   find on OrfeleMac.com.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:11.400]   And by the way, in French means the big 10-inch car car.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.400]   And I--
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.400]   Show titles.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.640]   And I love Google+, which is where I think you can really find me now.
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.640]   But I'm still--
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.640]   It's a lot of time.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:21.800]   But I'm still Cedric on Twitter, which really works.
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:22.800]   That's nice that you have that.
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.800]   You could have been Leo.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.800]   Yes, you could.
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:30.800]   Yeah, for a few months last year, they were sort of closing down on user accounts.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.640]   I want to be Leo Laport.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.480]   I am what I am, and that's all that I am.
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:38.560]   LeWeb is in Paris December 7th, 8th, and 9th.
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:39.560]   Three days.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:40.560]   You can go.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.560]   We certainly love it if you would.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.440]   We will be broadcasting from LeWeb.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.640]   We're going to have a special Twit booth there.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.040]   And we will be interviewing people from LeWeb.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:52.720]   So all of these great speakers like Phil Lybin from Evernote and Marissa Meyer from
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:55.520]   Google, Jeremy Stoppelman from Yelp.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:59.040]   And maybe even that Mike Errington guy will be joining us now.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.160]   Screw you, Mike, for a rip freeze.
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:04.520]   We'll be joining us at our LeWeb coverage.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:10.200]   Jeff Jarvis is the host of this week in Google, which we see every Wednesday on the Twit Network.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200]   At 1 p.m.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.200]   Pacific, 4 p.m.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.200]   Eastern at Twit.tv.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:16.800]   And also, of course, the great blogger at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.920]   And yes, an active participant in Google+, as Jeff Jarvis.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.120]   Great to have you, Jeff.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.120]   You're here except Dvorak.
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.120]   Yeah, really.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:25.520]   He's the one left out.
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:28.240]   I have an account, and you can go and find it.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.240]   I have posted.
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.240]   Have you?
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:31.240]   What was the last time?
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.240]   Oh, month ago, maybe.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.240]   What's the rush?
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:35.240]   What's the rush?
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:36.240]   What's the rush?
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.080]   When I had that Elgin gave me this automated thing, I made it.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:39.080]   That's pretty cool.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.320]   I may follow up.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.320]   You could use it as the...
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.320]   I'll listen to him.
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:43.320]   He'll be my guru.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.320]   The base station.
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:47.320]   Anyway, Jeff, great to have you.
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:48.320]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.320]   Thank you for having me here.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:50.320]   I love being on the Twit as well.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:53.320]   Yeah, we'd love having you.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.920]   Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:57.120]   We do this show every Sunday on Twit.TV.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.160]   By the way, notice I don't say live.Twit.TV anymore, because the new website, which has
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.920]   launched, and we've worked on it.
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:03.920]   I know it's not perfect.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.760]   It's still a field trial, but we've worked and we're improving it.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.760]   We still have more to do.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:13.520]   I know we're hearing your compliments and complaints with Twit.TV.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:18.600]   I think we're getting very close to finally the site that Twit deserved, and you can
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.200]   watch live there.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:27.200]   Twit.TV whenever we're on any show, but 3PM Sundays, 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern, 2200
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:28.200]   UTC.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.200]   That's the time if you want to watch live.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.240]   And of course, after the fact, you can get it from that site as well.
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:33.240]   Twit.TV.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:38.360]   Thank you all for being here, and we'll see you next time.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.360]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.360]   This is amazing.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:51.360]   [MUSIC]
