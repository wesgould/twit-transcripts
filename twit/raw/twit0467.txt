[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.520]   Ben Thompson from Stretechary joins Dan Gilmore and me as we talk about the week's tech news,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.560]   those big layoffs at Microsoft.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.920]   Revelation's about the security of the iPhone, even iOS 7 and why Netflix seems to have all
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.360]   wrong about me, honest.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.360]   It's wrong.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.360]   So I'm coming up next.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.360]   I'm Twit.

[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.760]   and obsessive detail.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.480]   And usually have a little bit of fun doing it, so glad you're here and glad to have our
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.200]   guests on Dan Gilmore, journalist, Rach Haunter, Dan Gilmore.com.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.640]   You'll see his columns in The Guardian as well as elsewhere.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.600]   He also teaches right now at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.480]   where he tries to beat digital media literacy into the heads of the students at the Arizona
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480]   State University.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.840]   How's that going for you?
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   Good.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   How's that going?
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   Good.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.840]   And promoting entrepreneurship.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.840]   It's a good start for our nation.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.480]   I think promoting entrepreneurship is probably an easier thing to do with young people today.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.080]   I think they realize that if they don't make a job, they're not going to have a job in
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   many cases.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.680]   Thanks for joining us, Dan.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   We appreciate it.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.720]   Also here from Stratecary, one of the most insightful analysts.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.080]   I'm quoting them all the time on the scene today.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.520]   Ben Thompson, good to have you.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   Ben, welcome.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.160]   Good to be here.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.680]   Monk bent on Twitter.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.600]   Is there a beat for Stratecary?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.880]   I know you do a paid newsletter.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.520]   That's kind of your bread and butter.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.240]   But you're not aiming at investors or anything like that particularly, are you?
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.840]   I do think it's a great, great service for investors because it gives a lot of context
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.960]   to what's happening, but I don't give specific buy, sell advice or anything like that.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.760]   Which does limit how much I can charge as well.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.520]   The way I think about it is I've been doing Stratecary for about a year and a half now
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.560]   and giving pretty contextual, hopefully very contextual analysis of what's happening in
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.920]   tech.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.160]   What the newsletter just does that is does that every day, three items, not as long as
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.760]   the articles on Stratecary, but much more direct and to the point, this is what's happening.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.600]   This is why I think it's happening.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.240]   Things to think about.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.160]   It's definitely the thing that can be the most value add.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.520]   There's so many voices with the tech news, the tech story, but there's so few, I think,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.240]   voices talking about what it means.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.160]   I think Dan and Ben are both really adept.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.960]   That's why we have Jan Twig, because that's what Twig is all about too, is trying to understand
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.360]   what's going on.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.440]   The biggest story, of course, Satya Nadella dropped the other shoe and is firing 14% of
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.600]   Microsoft's employees, the largest layoff in the history of Microsoft.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.520]   They announced this, of course, on Thursday, but Nadella had kind of telegraphed that it
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.560]   was coming in a couple of cryptic emails in which he implied that we are realigning the
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.600]   company.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.040]   Most of these employees, something like 12,500 were Nokia employees.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.840]   I think while it is a huge layoff, it does seem to me that of these 18,000 jobs, the
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.640]   vast majority really are redundant people that were acquired when they merged with Nokia.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.360]   Is this a sign that Microsoft's in trouble or is Microsoft doing the right thing?
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.520]   It's funny because I've actually done vacation for the last week, which is unfortunate that
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.960]   these came down at the time, because if there's...
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.240]   This is your natural beat, isn't it?
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.720]   One thing I've written about probably more than anything else is Microsoft specifically
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.240]   the challenges they're facing, how I think they need to align themselves going forward.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.520]   I thought the first memo in particular was very encouraging.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.280]   He got you too.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.960]   Well, I'm happy to go to the mad on this.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.360]   I think a lot of the criticism focusing on word length and all this sort of stuff.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.120]   3,000 words.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:57.160]   When you're dealing with a company of 130,000 people, it's easy enough to sit on the side
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.280]   and say, "It ought to be like this," without appreciating this is how it works in a very
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.800]   large corporation with tons of people who are going to be hanging every word.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.440]   You don't worry about keeping the company moving.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.840]   There's a lot that goes into these emails.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:24.120]   I agree in a vacuum, it would be great if they could be short succinct and punchy with
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.440]   a comedic twist towards the end.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.640]   That's not the way these communications work.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.880]   Actually, for communications or Microsoft communication in particular, I thought it was
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   pretty clear.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.160]   It was we're going from a company that just a year ago had their CEO saying everything's
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.960]   about Windows, Windows Matters, Windows, Windows, Windows to a yes, very long email
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.080]   that said the word Windows, at least in the context of the PC operating system, one time.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.160]   It said the word Nokia one time.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.880]   When people focusing on that, "Oh, there's no change," to my opinion, it could not be
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.240]   more wrong with that specifically.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.040]   It was a complete refocusing of the company.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.720]   It was very clear that there were further shoes to come down and obviously one of them
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.920]   came down this week.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.240]   That's what John Llegasse said.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.120]   This is the typical email from a CEO.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.600]   I know I used to be President of Apple where you don't want to be too specific, but you
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.880]   want to be able to point to the email and say, "See, I warned you we were going to be
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   laying people off.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   I told you."
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.800]   Well, I mean, the way I thought they were quite queer in the email when you talk about
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.640]   it was obvious they were going to have organizing.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.080]   You know what, when they acquired Nokia, it was obvious.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.080]   Nokia has what?
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.400]   25,000 employees.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.800]   There was a lot of overlap.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.520]   Yeah, and that's probably the most disappointing thing actually, honestly, is the fact that hosts
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.640]   Nokia, they're still larger than they were pre-Nokia.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.040]   I've actually been writing and suggesting that they're going to need more layoffs.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.920]   I've been writing to the new layoffs before the Nokia thing even happened, which I do
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.920]   still think is the case.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.800]   We talk about being a productivity company where you're not one of the major platforms.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.600]   You don't need 105,000 people.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:17.520]   And so, I would have been better, in my opinion, to have cut deeper and to try to have done
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.680]   it just one time because I'm not sure that this is going to be enough.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.760]   It's pretty clear the stock market likes...
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.720]   Well, John, stock market always likes cutting jobs because that means lower costs theoretically
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.920]   higher profits, but the stock market reacted pretty well.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.080]   Microsoft stock took a fairly big jump.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.560]   Well, Microsoft's been selling.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.160]   I mean, they were at...
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.680]   Stuck between 25 and 30 for a decade.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.600]   And they've been in the '40s for quite a while.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.520]   And again, I don't think that's...
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.320]   I think that's because for anyone that's being serious about it, there's been very clear
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.820]   shifts.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.120]   You don't turn an oil...
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.080]   I wanted to write something because I was trying to look for the bread analogy.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.400]   I was trying to find how long does it take to turn a super-tinker and take something like
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.520]   eight hours.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.880]   And once you start the turning process, it doesn't happen right away.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.080]   And this is the thing with Microsoft is if ever there were a super-tinker in tech, it's
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.240]   them for better or worse.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.200]   To me, that first memo was saying, "Okay, turn starboard."
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.320]   And the actual process of turning a starboard to then express disappointment that it hasn't
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:36.200]   yet turned around is to me to be kind of...
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   There's a word for it.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.920]   I can't remember where it is, but it's not a nice one.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.760]   You remember, you don't want to say it.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.200]   Dan, is it feel like...
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.080]   Sometimes I feel like we're only talking about Microsoft because historically they've
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.440]   been important.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.400]   But is Microsoft still relevant in a world where everybody's using smartphones and tablets
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.360]   and the cloud?
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.960]   Well, yeah, of course it's still important.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:06.360]   And everyone's using those things, but a few hundred people are also using...
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.520]   A few hundred million people are also using PCs and Windows.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.120]   So they're clearly important.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.160]   Their document formats are still largely standard.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.120]   They're doing a lot of stuff that is going to be with us for a long time to come.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   And I agree on that memo.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.880]   It was certainly wordy and it was certainly all over the place.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.840]   But you hadn't read it, I think, in the context of a state of the union address where every
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.080]   department in the government is fighting to get some language in, where it's almost
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.360]   always a giant mess and most presidents go on way too long when they give it.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.480]   I think it's in that category.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:11:00.000]   And I really agree with Ben that this is a significant shift.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.240]   I still don't quite understand why they bought Nokia in the first place.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.280]   In fact, they're retrenching a little bit because there's Nokia X devices which were
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.600]   Android phones.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.440]   Looks like at least some of them are now going to be Windows phones again.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.720]   Oh, yeah, I'm sorry just to jump in, but this is the thing that really irks me about
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.920]   this is people saying blame...
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.280]   I don't know Nadella, but to blame him for Microsoft's state as a lot of this Christmas
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.280]   is not...
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280]   Oh, no, he inherited it.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   No, no, no.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.760]   Yeah, I mean, he's doing the best he can to dig out from years of mismanagement, I think.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.720]   Well, it wasn't just the years of mismanagement, though.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.880]   I mean, what Ballmer did on his way out of the company with reorganizing and then buying
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:45.040]   Nokia, like compounded to a significant degree in all the problems that Microsoft had.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:52.400]   And Ballmer left him with Windows 8, a giant Nokia acquisition, and a whole new goal,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.840]   devices and services.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.760]   Well, it's not a goal.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.920]   It's a tactic that makes no sense.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.800]   Has Nadella abandoned devices and services as an idea?
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:08.480]   Yes, that was the best thing about the memo was he actually very explicitly moved on from
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.640]   devices and services.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.920]   He's like, "This was nice, but we need to move on and this is what we're going to do
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.920]   instead."
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.920]   And so that's...
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.520]   I don't like to be in that board meeting.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.200]   Steve Ballmer is still on the board.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.320]   Bill Gates is on the board.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.560]   I'd like to be on the fly on the wall satya and says, "Hey, by the way, we're going to
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   change that.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   You know that devices and services thing?
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   We're not going to do that."
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.400]   Yeah, no, I have it right here, actually.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.200]   I'm going to quote from the memo.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.440]   It says, "More recently, we have described ourselves as a quote, devices and services
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   company.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.920]   Well, the devices and services description was helpful in starting your transformation.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.320]   We now need to hone in on our unique strategy.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.080]   Like, that is corporate speak for the board, the previous guys messed up.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.040]   And all this stuff now is about unpacking Steve Ballmer's last six months.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   At the time I wrote it, lots of people wrote it.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.440]   It still boggles my mind that he could have done all that on the way out the door.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.200]   Patterson in our chatroom Dan says, "All CEOs have to remodel the kitchen.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.680]   Is this kitchen remodeling or is this something going a little deeper?"
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.600]   Oh, it's way deeper.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.480]   And it's pretty clear that, by the way, when the board hired this guy for the CEO job,
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.880]   they knew what was coming.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:25.160]   He put it this way, Microsoft is not an incompetent company.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.440]   Their board is a bunch of smart people.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.600]   Plainly, he said, "Here's what I'm going to do if you make my CEO."
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.000]   And they said, "Fine.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.760]   I'm certainly willing to believe that Steve Ballmer was not thrilled with that, but he's
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.640]   one guy on the board at this point and owns a lot of stock, but that's not enough.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.440]   I think this is an important shift.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:56.000]   I don't know where it's going to go, but Microsoft certainly was running along in place.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.880]   But keep in mind, when they run in place, they're still printing money.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.360]   Yeah, that's pretty spectacularly.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.800]   You have to plan for the future.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.000]   You know that that's not going to continue forever.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.440]   Or you're going to -- IBM's still around whether they're as relevant, I don't know.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.680]   But at some point, you have to make a shift.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.200]   Now, the good news is it strikes me, and I think the reason that Nadella got the job
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.160]   because he was running the enterprise side and the Azure side, the cloud side.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.080]   The good news is the future strikes me.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.600]   The future really is a cloudy, future, cloud-based future.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.560]   And that Microsoft is in his well positioned with Azure to do that.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.320]   The other thing too is Nadella opposed the Nokia acquisition.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:47.760]   So he is absolutely 100% cleaning up a mess that he did not create.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.720]   And actually, it's that acquisition that, yes, they are smart people on the board, but
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   I do think I'm going to be looking for changes there over the next year to see just how much
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.240]   change the company is really willing to think about and go forward with.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:15.560]   The devices thought -- I mean, I've never been believing that the devices were their
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.000]   future in particular.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.760]   But I have to say, when they really put their minds to making some good hardware, they do
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.520]   a hell of a job.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.160]   And the Xbox is terrific.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.200]   Well, the Surface -- Xbox 360 not so terrific.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.080]   The Xbox One is good.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.400]   I mean, they've stumbled a few times.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   They have.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.480]   But they've also gotten some stuff right.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.480]   They've created a real platform with the Xbox.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.480]   Yes.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.000]   The Surface, the new one, it looks really nice to me.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.320]   I'm not saying this is -- there's an element of, well, let's be Apple in some of the newer
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320]   stuff.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.720]   But that's obviously not going to happen.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:01.040]   I think they had to cut on that one quickly on the phones because they're just not going
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   anywhere with those.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   The other thing that people --
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.800]   Well, I don't know, but the phones -- oh, sorry.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.280]   No, no, please, Ben.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.880]   I would say, well, the phones, they're cutting, though.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.520]   They're cutting all the feature phones and all the low-end phones.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.120]   They're keeping the Lumias.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.320]   And the problem I have with the devices is the Lumias are very nice.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.240]   And the Surface is, especially the most recent version, as you said, is very nice.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:28.840]   The problem, though, is the way you sell a device for a premium is because it's differentiated.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.400]   And you differentiate it most effectively with your own services and your own software
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.600]   on top of it.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:40.880]   The problem is the motivation to do that is exactly opposite the motivation you need
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.400]   to be a great services company full stop.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.400]   A services company needs to work on all devices.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.000]   He needs to work on iOS devices.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.800]   He needs to work on Android devices.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.720]   He needs to work all over the place.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.800]   And what's encouraging is Microsoft is making great strides there.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.520]   Office for iPads is obviously the most visible part of this.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:04.240]   But it's problematic for the company to have these two diametrically-opposed incentives
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   going on, and especially given its history of being a platform company, of being the
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.600]   Windows company, it actually strikes me -- I think we're going to write about this for
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.880]   tomorrow as you're getting a preview.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:24.560]   Like maybe now, maybe especially with Nokia on board, like this would be the time finally
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.520]   for to think about, would it be better off being two companies?
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.600]   Didn't the Dell S8 pretty explicitly -- I'm not going to -- despite the fact we're moving
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.640]   away from devices and services, I'm not getting rid of Xbox.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.280]   I think he implied we're not getting rid of Nokia.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.640]   We're not going to spin off or stop Surface.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.360]   He did kind of put the kibosh on the mini Surface and Windows RT.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.880]   Yeah, it's hard to say though, because he put those weight on the memo and barely mentioned
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   them.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.040]   And if you want to get into the kind of corporate memo criminology that --
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.480]   They're not on top.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.000]   They're not drivers, but they're not gone.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   That's true.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.640]   But it doesn't suggest they hide.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.000]   You can go either way, this.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.880]   Regional people can completely disagree.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.960]   I suspect Nadella personally is not a fan of this strategy.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.520]   I think he's very attuned to the incentive argument that I just laid out, especially
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   with his background.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:31.040]   But it's one of those things like, that's a pretty -- he's done a lot.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.440]   That's going to take more than six months.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.040]   You know what might be most important to do is to change a toxic corporate culture.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.480]   It strikes me, and I'm not an insider, obviously.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.600]   But when I talk to insiders, they say that one of the issues for years with Microsoft
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.720]   was you had all these divisions that were really fighting against each other.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.800]   And the office division was going to make damn sure that there was no office in the
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:58.440]   iPad, because that would undermine office regardless of whether it was a good strategy.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.960]   Nadella made sure office on the iPad came out even before office, had a touch version
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   for Windows.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.960]   He needs to -- it strikes me that one of the things he needs to do is get rid of this
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   toxic culture.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.400]   That was the way that they were stack ranking employees, things like that.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.440]   That was Windows not letting office be on other platforms, because they wanted that
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.440]   to differentiate.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.440]   They wanted it.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   That's right.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.440]   Right.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.440]   That was a reason why Windows.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.440]   Right.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.600]   It's too bad they didn't break up the company about 15 years ago.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   That's what Devorac always called for.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.840]   He said there should be three Microsofts.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:40.360]   You'd triple the value, because each company has value, but they have disparate goals.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.400]   There's no sense in having it all be one.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.840]   I suppose Nadella could still do this, although it seems like that moment has passed.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.840]   Well, I don't know.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.200]   It's funny, because I'm sympathetic to both arguments on that.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:01.480]   Back when the Just Department thing was, they're having their legal troubles.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:08.400]   Even then though, it was still a very cohesive, positive feedback cycle for the company.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.240]   Windows supporting office, supporting servers, supporting office.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:17.480]   Today though, what is Windows really doing for Microsoft Cloud services?
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.360]   It feels like Windows' legacy.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.280]   Nadella recognizes this, that he's saying, "We're going to be cross-platform."
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.320]   The problem though is you can say that.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.240]   The CEO can say that, and this gets into the whole of the memo stuff and changing culture
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.200]   stuff, but to actually have that trickle down through the bureaucracy and to actually have
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   that.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   That's my question.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   Act differently.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.680]   Is he prepared to reinvent this toxic corporate culture that has held Microsoft back?
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:51.040]   Well, you know the saying that's pretty true, which is that culture eats strategy for breakfast.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.880]   So, this is the...
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880]   No, totally.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:59.720]   The thing about a toxic corporate culture is it's not usually toxic per se, it's more
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   like ransed.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   It's like food that was very good.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.960]   I think that's much more at...
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.920]   Microsoft.toxic gets ransed.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.480]   It's gone bad.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.880]   It's gone bad.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.480]   It's not appropriate for the current environment.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.280]   To me, that's the worry, is everything that support Windows, everything that support our
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.360]   platform and then support phone.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.960]   That's the Microsoft.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.880]   That's worked for them for 25 years, and now that's exactly what they need to not do.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.040]   And I'm not sure that that can be done by Fiat.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.480]   Well, talking about toxic corporate culture, we're going to talk about toxic customer service.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.520]   The customer service call heard round the world coming up in just a moment.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.200]   We got a call from Ryan Bloch's mother, apparently, yesterday saying, "Ryan does not want to
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.800]   be known for this."
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.200]   Sorry, Ryan.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.400]   Too late.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.160]   This is Kevin Rose, as known as a raccoon thrower.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.080]   Ryan Bloch now is known as he who slays Comcast customer service.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.920]   We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.560]   You're going to put a link to the raccoon thrower.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.080]   I forgot about that.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.960]   We got Kevin on the next day.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   We tried to get...
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.400]   Are you really sure you want to go to a commercial?
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.760]   What makes you believe that you need to go to a commercial right now?
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.760]   Why do you do that?
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.760]   Give us a reason.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.000]   No, no, I want to go to a commercial.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.600]   Please, I beg you.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.160]   Now, we need a better reason than that.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.720]   You're interrupting the number one technology nutcast online.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.440]   Why would you want to interrupt this?
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.720]   We can't allow it.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.280]   You have to give us a better explanation.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.520]   I'm suffering, still suffering, post-traumatic stress syndrome from listening to that call.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520]   You do this now.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.040]   Hi, I'm Adam Gilmer.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.600]   There's also here, great journalist and writer at The Guardian, but now professor of some
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.120]   lucky students at Arizona State who are getting him in the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.520]   But first a word from our friends because I'm going to go to a commercial.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.880]   I don't care what you say from Citrix who do go to meeting.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.640]   Citrix go to meeting is the way.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.280]   If you've got a team that's spread out, who doesn't now?
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.560]   We have people all over the world who work for us.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:07.400]   If you've got clients, people you're pitching spread out, of course, because you're a global
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.440]   entity, there's really no way to meet with these people in person.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   You still got to meet.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440]   You still got to pitch.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.440]   You still got to present.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.960]   You need Citrix go to meeting the number one way.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.720]   To do this, you share the same screens here all on the same page, literally.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   You turn on that HD video conferencing.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.080]   You're literally seeing each other face to face.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.240]   It's better than meeting in person.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.920]   It's a lot better than a teleconference.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.240]   Whenever we're going to do a voice conference, we start to go to meeting because that way
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.120]   you have all of those features available.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.480]   You can even present from an iPad.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.320]   You're mobile too.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.320]   You can be mobile.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   You can be joining a meeting.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.640]   You can be presenting.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:48.120]   You can read your 30-day free trial of Citrix go to meeting by visiting gotomeeting.com.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.240]   Take a look at the features.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.280]   I mean, we're talking very nice HD video.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.960]   You can have those faces at the top of the screen and the side of the screen.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.320]   You can see the screen that the presenter is showing, the PowerPoint presentation, the
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.960]   spreadsheet, the document you're collaborating on.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.280]   It really is the best way to meet from the convenience, not only of your computer, but
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.000]   also your mobile device, your smartphone, and your tablet.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.840]   The best part is you pay one low, flat, monthly rate.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:17.440]   You meet as many times as you want, as long as you want with anyone from anywhere in a
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.640]   single virtual space.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.800]   I know teams that keep go to meeting running all day.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.400]   Share screens present in real time.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   Turn on those webcams.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   You're going to love it.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   Go to meeting.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.560]   If you are in a distributed environment, a distributed workforce, if you've got clients
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.400]   and colleagues elsewhere, you've got to try this.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:40.080]   Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button, and always ask, use the promo code TWIT for
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.720]   30 days free.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.760]   T-W-I-T right there.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.840]   Right there in the offer code.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.880]   Go to meeting.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.320]   One of the things, and we've played this, it all started, I think it was Monday or Tuesday,
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:25:01.840]   I saw Veronica Belmont post on Google+, she said, "We're moving and we wanted to replace
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.840]   Comcast."
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.480]   Ooh.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.000]   With the Stound, they're lucky.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   They live in San Francisco.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.360]   There are other choices in most of the country.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.200]   About 80% really only has choice between their cable company and their phone company.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.720]   We called Comcast and tried to cancel.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.240]   Veronica's on the phone with him for 10 minutes.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   Ryan, her husband's listening.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.480]   Of course, Ryan, we all know both of them have been on the show many times.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.320]   Ryan's listening, and here's Veronica becoming increasingly frustrated.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:38.840]   Fortunately, he starts a recorder, and the whole world heard the customer service call
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   from hell.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.440]   I'm not going to repeat it because you've probably all heard it by now.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.720]   You have to fill out your form, that's fine.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.040]   Please proceed to the next question.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.040]   That's Ryan.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   And we'll attempt to answer that in thought.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.040]   It maintains his cool.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   So, I mean, being that we are the number one provider of internet and TV service in
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   the entire country.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   Number one.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.640]   Why is it that you're not wanting to have the number one rated internet service?
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.120]   Number one rated TV service.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.400]   You want to punch the guy now?
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.720]   That's only minute 12.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.640]   It goes on and on and on.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.360]   Ryan says in his post on the SoundCloud post of the audio that he'd already given the
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.360]   guy the reasons.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.560]   It wasn't that he was withholding anything.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.240]   The guy didn't want to hear the reasons.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.280]   And what we've learned since, and I've received, Jeff Jarvis received, others have received
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   messages, emails, posts from former Comcast representatives, current Comcast customer
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.080]   service folks, third party Comcast customer reps.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:41.360]   And all of them pretty much agree that the issue is the corporate culture, that Comcast
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   in effect pays these guys a certain amount.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.280]   And every time somebody cancels on their watch, they lose money.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.000]   And at some point, they can get down to minimum wage if enough people cancel on their watch.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.600]   In fact, you'll hear the rep very early on say, can't you just go to the Comcast store
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.920]   and cancel there?
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.640]   That's not because he's trying to keep Ryan from canceling.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:07.120]   He's trying to keep Ryan from canceling on this phone call.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.560]   But this is another issue that I didn't know about.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.160]   This was from a been a paste bin post that went to Jeff Jarvis.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.120]   The big issue Comcast is a guy who's a Comcast rep.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.440]   The big issue Comcast reps face.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.600]   The systems we use are broken as Comcast has essentially bought its way to the top.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.640]   The computer programs haven't been upgraded.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   You know what?
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.880]   I always thought this because you hear that you're on the line with it and there's long
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.560]   pauses.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.760]   He says frequently I have to restart my computer with a customer on the phone, but I'm not
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.400]   allowed to tell them that Comcast doesn't want the customer to know that their systems
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.800]   aren't perfect.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:49.000]   Time is money if Comcast can push the blame onto the customer as fast as possible.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.320]   That's the best that's the best result.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.400]   He says the whole system.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.280]   This is a toxic culture Comcast apologized to Ryan said, we're going to look into this
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.880]   is never going to happen again.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.840]   Ryan Block very I think rightly so said on Twitter.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.040]   I don't want you to fire the guy.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.880]   I want you to reinvent yourself so that you're not a company that promotes this kind of behavior.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.640]   Who hasn't had this happen to them?
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:16.080]   In fact, Ryan works at AOL where this was who was notorious for this kind of customer
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.120]   retention.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.040]   Have any of you either of you had calls, customer service calls like this?
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.240]   Oh God, who hasn't?
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.240]   Who hasn't?
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:33.320]   It's getting a new customer is a lot harder than keeping an old one or it should be.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.880]   These guys as it's quite clear and they're in set of financial and otherwise is to not
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.560]   let anyone go if at all possible.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:49.480]   We just speaking of San Francisco, we were getting the San Francisco Chronicle Sunday
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:55.400]   edition and finally decided after they killed a section we particularly liked reading that
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.800]   there wasn't enough to get it anymore.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:06.160]   I spent 15 minutes trying to be polite to a guy who kept lowering the amount that I'd
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:13.680]   have to pay if we would just keep it.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.560]   When you make a decision, you've made the decision.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:24.760]   It's really odd and companies need to know how to take, know for an answer to just move
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.760]   on.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.920]   They probably be better off not having people annoyed at them all the time.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.560]   I think there's ample evidence now that it's treating the customer better is in the long
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   run better business.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.560]   Look at Amazon.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.920]   Here's a company that's customer first.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.960]   You call to send something back.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   They're happily exchanged.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.280]   Zappos, another example.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.280]   Now an Amazon company.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:52.600]   I think the evidence is strongly in favor of having a better customer relationship and
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.440]   not worrying so much about customer attention.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   You agree, Ben?
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:02.560]   Well, I love that we're discussing this story right after Microsoft actually for two reasons.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:10.680]   One is it really emphasizes or really shows off how powerful incentives are.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.720]   I'm happy to give this customer service representative the benefit of the doubt and
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   that he's a nice guy.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.200]   He's a great guy and he goes out with his friends and he doesn't.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.360]   Like insists that he buy them a beer like for 30 minutes.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.080]   Why won't you buy me a beer?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   I'm the number one friend.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.720]   You'll ever know you're not going to get a better friend.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.600]   You should buy me a beer.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.040]   The whole point is that this isn't natural human behavior.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   It is.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.960]   But he is being heavily incentivized to act in a certain way and that is not his responsibility.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.000]   That's Comcast responsibility.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.480]   And incentives are incredibly powerful things that act mostly on kind of a subconscious
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.720]   level.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.440]   And that's why I worry for Microsoft if they have misaligned incentives.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.920]   It's not because there are bad people there that are dumb.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.040]   It's because people respond to incentives whether they realize they're doing it or not.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   And this is just an extreme example of that.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:05.200]   Point two is, I mean, if I think the Comcast service sucks, what am I going to do?
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.640]   This is where you that's why this exists.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.680]   It's a monopoly.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.680]   Exactly.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:16.120]   Well, you know, there's a cynic might look at this particular situation and say Comcast
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:22.600]   in the throes of trying to basically gobble up what's left of the broadband industry apart
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.080]   from them.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:31.240]   You know, one might think if one was really cynical that this is all a setup so that they
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.040]   can say to the world, see, we have competition.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.360]   People want to leave us.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   I'm not.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.520]   Ryan Block has a choice.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:49.840]   And you know, it's that's unlikely, but the it is odd that they're so panicked about
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.960]   one guy leaving the.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.720]   We invited Ryan to come on the show and talk about this.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:32:00.120]   He is declining to do all media interviews because he wants it all to go away.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.800]   And but you know what, Ryan, you did everybody a service.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   And I, this was the shot heard around the world.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.120]   David Letterman played it.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.560]   The networks played it.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.920]   It was on the news everywhere.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.080]   It got a lot of play because it resonated, I think, with everybody listening to it.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.200]   We've all been on that call.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.600]   And I have to think this is going to have some, maybe some serious impact on Comcast.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.280]   Perhaps even on the Comcast time Warner merger.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.600]   This is a company that, you know, maybe they're maybe they're not alone.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.120]   Maybe a lot of companies act like this, but it's pretty clearly a company that is mistreating
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.280]   its employees and its customers.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.800]   And really should they be allowed to grow any bigger?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.320]   Well, see, I presume with five million views, five million listens on SoundCloud.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   Wow.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.480]   I don't think it would have an impact though because I mean, like I said, like, what are
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.480]   you going to do?
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.040]   I can be, I was, I've already discussed it with Comcast.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.320]   Like how much more disgusted can I be?
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   And I'm still going to be a subscriber because I value high speed internet more than I value
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.240]   like my integrity and the.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   Oh, it's true.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.040]   I'm like, I'm like, we.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.840]   Stock home syndrome, we are held hostage.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.200]   I'm a Comcast internet customer.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   You know what?
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.600]   I have a tail very similar.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:19.480]   Friday, I was late for dinner because I was on the line with Comcast and I, I actually
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.000]   pay Comcast twice for an event.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.440]   I upgraded to Comcast business, but I cannot for the life of me get them to turn off the
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   consumer internet.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:31.120]   I'm afraid that if I do that, they'll turn off everything and I can't afford to be with
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   that internet.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.280]   They have me.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.880]   We, you know, at home, we have two services.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:43.000]   We use Comcast as well as sonic.net for DSL.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Sonic's awesome.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.160]   There's an example of a beautifully run company.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:54.120]   If, if we had actual competition for very high speed broadband, and by the way, Comcast
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:59.200]   fastest service is not really all that high speed compared to what people in other countries
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   are getting.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.280]   But compared to what we're getting in this country, it is.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.200]   But it's still, you know, laughable when I think about what's possible.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.880]   So that's, that's the real issue here.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   We don't have serious competition for actual broadband and the way Congress is going, it
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.400]   doesn't look like we ever will.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:23.640]   And that's going to be tragic for the future of this country in innovation and communications.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   You know, I have, I have kind of.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   Go ahead then.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.240]   No, no, I was just going to anecdotal.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.040]   We were, we've been having, Chad can tell you, we've been having a few connections.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.120]   She's with me here.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.840]   I'm actually in the United States this time.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   Last time I was in Taiwan.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.920]   Yeah, welcome home, by the way.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   Just for the summer.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.120]   But, no, it's, it's every time I come back to the States, it's jarring.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.520]   Like, it's better in time.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.040]   I'll pour, oh, infinitely better.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.800]   I've, I mean, I like a hundred down and 40 up and I pay like $30 a month.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.760]   Is it government run or is it, is it a private industry?
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.920]   Well, so they, they have, it's very, the whole net neutrality thing and the competition
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.760]   thing is very complicated in the US.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.560]   But in Taiwan, it is like it is in Europe and lots of other countries.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.280]   The, there's a separation between owning the wires and providing the service.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:20.040]   So there's lots of, there's lots of ISPs that offer service over, over the same wires.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.520]   You think too, because it's much more densely populated is that DSL is actually more of
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.320]   a viable solution, because if you're within like a mile or two miles of a switch, then
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.880]   it can be very high speed.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:35.960]   But yeah, but there's more competition on the cable wire and there's more types of connections,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.720]   which which both of which make a huge difference.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   Who owns the wire?
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.480]   Does the government own the wire?
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   That's a good question.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.000]   I bet it does.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.640]   I think it's the national.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   I shouldn't say anything.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   I'll probably be wrong.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:57.040]   So, so this is one thing that, so I've kind of, I'm really torn on the net neutrality issue.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.120]   And this comes down to that.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.040]   A lot of people, including Alexis O'Hane, many of the many of the EFF and others, think
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   that the solution is for the FCC to declare telecommunications broadband providers covered
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.800]   as titled by Title II of the Telecommunications Act, that they are common carriers or utilities,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.280]   hence should be regulated by the FCC.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.400]   On the other hand, I've heard from a lot of people, that's the last thing you want.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.640]   Of course, and even even at the EFF, I know I've talked to John Perry Barlow, who says
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.840]   there's dissent among the board at the EFF, because while yes, we want to free an open
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.800]   internet, many of us feel the worst possible thing you could do is have the government start
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.280]   to intervene on how the internet is run.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.680]   Title II could be, in fact, the worst thing that could happen to the internet.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.800]   And it's hard for us to know ahead of time.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.040]   I think something, though, that everyone agrees on is that the real key to this is having true
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.040]   competition.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:57.120]   And one way to do it is to have the government own the infrastructure and then open up the
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   internet providing on top of it to a total competition.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:05.680]   And one of the reasons we have monopolies or a duopoly is because it's so expensive
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.720]   to put the cable in the ground that the FCC said to the cable companies, you can have
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:18.040]   a regional monopoly to pay for the cost of trenching.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.280]   Maybe the time is to give that up.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.280]   I don't know.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.600]   But I do feel like competition is a solution.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.280]   Is that even viable in the United States?
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.800]   We've got such a mess going on right now.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:34.080]   It just seems like it's better than Title II, which has huge inherent risks.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.640]   I'm very mixed as well for many of those reasons.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.440]   I mean, there's lots of stuff going on here.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.400]   I mean, first off, the government did give-- and remember, they started with community
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.880]   access television, which was basically a shared antenna.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.160]   This helped most people got started.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.680]   And in this case, because government didn't want to pay for all the installation, they
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   made a deal.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:04.760]   And so the people, yes, government provided lots of value, particularly than eminent domain
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.960]   and things like that.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.480]   But the actual cost of putting that cable in the ground was borne by shareholders.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.800]   By the way, I noticed that as soon as we start talking about this stuff, the internet goes
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.300]   to hell.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.760]   We've lost both Dan and Ben.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:25.040]   You know who our provider is here in the Brickhouse Studios Comcast?
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.640]   I think they pulled a switch.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   I know.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   They're mad at what I was saying.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   I'm backing out.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:35.680]   Because I don't think it's you guys because it's happening here.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.720]   The worst company in the world.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.080]   I'll say it again.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.080]   I hear you've been.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.560]   Tell you we're going to take a break.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.400]   We'll continue this conversation while we attempt to get our internet back in order.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.400]   It's a good thing.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.720]   Nat neutrality is a very deep rabbit hole.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.120]   We may never come out.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.880]   I mean, almost every show for the last six months, it's ended up descending into this net neutrality
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   discussion.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.320]   I've just more and more come into the opinion that competition is a solution, whatever we
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.640]   can do to foster competition, that's going to be better than having heavy-handed government
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.720]   regulation on the internet.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.600]   Because all of a sudden, I don't want to have to adhere to FCC rules at TWIT.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.640]   I think that that would be the worst possible thing to happen.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.280]   I think it's a little overdone.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.720]   What you're right on is it's another incentive issue.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.240]   We need to have the right incentives in place.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.960]   The incentive is also to keep building infrastructure.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:30.520]   Mark Andriesen had one of the best statements in this whole thing, which is that the problem
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:35.040]   with comparing the internet to the sewage system is we don't crap 10 times more every
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   10 years.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.360]   I mean, Comcast has there is some legitimate concern from the internet service providers
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:48.240]   that we're using a lot more bandwidth all the time.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.640]   There's a back and forth over Netflix right now, Verizon released a very deceptive diagram
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:59.240]   that clearly shows using colors that the problem is all Netflix's.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.640]   It's Netflix's red.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.160]   Everything else is green, but Netflix is red.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.520]   I think a lot of people looked at that diagram and said, "Oh, yeah, it's obvious."
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.440]   Level three kind of chimed in and said, "Yeah, that's a little bit misleading."
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.520]   The real issue is not how much bandwidth is inside of Netflix network, how much bandwidth
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.520]   is inside of our network, how much bandwidth is inside of Comcast.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.120]   In all three cases, there's plenty.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.800]   It's the interconnects.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.040]   What level three, who is one of Comcast's backbone providers, has said again and again,
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.600]   we are willing even to give money to Comcast to upgrade their interconnect.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.000]   Their interconnect is not fast enough.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.640]   We're providing them with huge amount of bandwidth, a giant pipe.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:41.040]   They got a little bitty pipe and they consistently refuse Verizon, Comcast's five, the five big
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.200]   ISPs in the US refuse to upgrade that pipe.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.720]   We'll even pay for it and they won't do it.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.600]   The reason is they want to put the screws to Netflix and say, "Oh, you see, it's all
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.320]   Netflix fault, but it's really that little bitty pipe that Comcast in this case, Verizon
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   has attached."
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:01.400]   Anyway, it's one of those subjects that you have to have expertise in technology, in politics,
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.720]   you have to have inside information on how the backbone's working.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.800]   No one really, certainly no Senator, no Congress member could possibly fathom this, no member
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.920]   of the court system and no technology journalist.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.720]   It's something so heatously compact, complex.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.360]   It's not, though, actually, Leo.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.360]   It's good.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:27.720]   Through this, it's a lot of the technology in the back is complex, but you had it right
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   the first time.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:37.120]   You separate the provision of the access, which is a service, from the content inside
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   the service.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:43.800]   That's not easy to do at this point because we've let these people create these mega companies
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.920]   that combine it.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.800]   And we've given them permission to make decisions about what bids get delivered, but that doesn't
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   have to be.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:58.200]   They can make plenty of money by being the providers of the pipe and selling access to
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.040]   people who then provide it in turn to the rest of us.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:09.920]   It's really, Title II is a problematic thing to do, but it could be done with a very light
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.120]   touch that would just encourage competition.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.800]   I think we're sometimes trying to think about the horribles that might happen when we can
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.520]   see right in our face.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.120]   There's things that are going on and that are going to get much worse in the very near
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.040]   future if we don't do something fairly quick.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   I agree.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.040]   I agree.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.040]   Very well put.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:37.800]   Bob Frankston, one of the creators of VisiCalc, right, is a big promoter of community internet.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.200]   He says local communities should use eminent.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.960]   This is, boy, this is controversial.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.320]   She uses eminent domain to take over these infrastructures that the cable company, the
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.880]   phone companies have put in.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.240]   Hey, look, thank you very much.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   Nice job.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.600]   You've amortized your investment.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   Glad about that.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:57.440]   Now we're going to take it over and we will lease them back to providers, as many providers
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.880]   as we possibly can, to provide competition.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.360]   This is public infrastructure.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:08.280]   This is the gas, the sewer, the water, and we'll run it and we'll let many companies
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.080]   float over it.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.880]   For sure, if you do that, there'll be one company that says, "We're not going to any
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.320]   way restrict what you do.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.400]   We're not going to pack its sniff.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.120]   That's all you need is competition.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   One company."
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:26.120]   Sonic, that's a good example of a company, Dame Jasper, the CEO, an independent internet
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.480]   service provider who was for a long time said, "Look, we're not metering.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.920]   We're not shaping.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   We're not doing anything.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.240]   You get all the bits you want."
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:40.320]   The cost of providing the bits is dropping like a stone.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.040]   The arguments from the telecoms that, "Oh my God, all this stuff that's being used, well,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.600]   their cost of providing it is dropping and their ability to get more and more things
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:56.880]   in the same lines is expanding at a pretty rapid rate, too.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.920]   I hope we get this right, but I'm pretty much afraid.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   I'm completely despair.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.000]   At least now we're getting into the lobbying and money in government.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.400]   Oh, it's not going to stop.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   It's crazy.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.960]   None of this is ever going to happen.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.720]   We get the internet we deserve.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.040]   We are going into the next ad spawn.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.040]   I'm very depressing tone.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   I'm not sure how to do this.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   Okay, let me lift you up.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   Upbeat.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.200]   Surely there's a tap dancing kid who can do great yo-yo tricks that we can just show
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.880]   that video for a few seconds and everybody forget their troubles.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.320]   Chad, you must have something like that.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   That'll work.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.680]   Let me quickly look into my bag of tricks.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.840]   No, we have Rose throwing the raccoon.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.840]   That will work perfectly.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:47.040]   It's Kevin Rose throwing a raccoon.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.080]   We need, no, that's depressing, too.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.360]   We need really to have a little bumper, something that we could drop in.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.600]   That's what YouTube's for, isn't it?
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:01.440]   YouTube is to distract us from the grim reality of our lives.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.600]   I believe that's in their charter.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.560]   Until Comcast throttles.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560]   Until Comcast throttles.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560]   Here you go.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   I have the next best thing.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:14.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, we pause for this word from a child with spoon on his eyes.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.720]   Thank you very much, child.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.720]   Hi, I'm sorry.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.720]   I didn't see you there.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.360]   I was too busy blocking out the hangers.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.360]   Thank you, YouTube.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.560]   Our show today brought to you by...
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.560]   That was awful.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.360]   Doesn't matter.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:34.560]   It cheered you up.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:40.720]   If you are managing a giant project, a giant software project, and you are daunted by the
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:46.400]   challenges posed, surely you have heard of Atlassian and their great product, Jira.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.720]   If you haven't, try it right now.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.800]   Jira is one of the world's most powerful, customizable, issue and project management systems.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.240]   We were talking about how important the software systems are in a company like Comcast, where
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240]   they just...
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.240]   The systems don't work.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.560]   That means the reps can't do their job.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.840]   That means customer service suffers.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.880]   Having great systems can transform what you're doing.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.560]   Jira is an example of that.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.400]   It will capture and organize your workflow.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.240]   You can prioritize what you're doing, take action on what's important, stay up to date
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.560]   with the activity going on around you.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:24.640]   You can capture, organize, prioritize all the issues, all the tasks, the features, the
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.720]   bugs, and your giant project to give your team a very easy to use interface.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.880]   Let's them collaborate in real time.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:38.920]   Actually, you play the video on the Atlassian Jira site, because it really is...
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.280]   If you're in this situation, you know you need this.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:46.880]   You can integrate all the documents from all the different places, your backlogs, your issues,
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.040]   your cold repository.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.560]   It works with Git, of course.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.640]   In fact, that allows teams to follow the code all the way from development to delivery.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.400]   It's funny, I didn't realize this, but I've actually been using Jira for years.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.400]   What?
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.800]   Here, let me see if I can find it.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.560]   I've been using it because Minecraft...
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.320]   You're not a programmer.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:15.120]   No, but Minecraft's bug tracker has been a Jira product.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.400]   They're using that.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.640]   It's just wonderful, and I have intimate knowledge of everything, because I've issued a few
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   bugs.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.640]   This is...
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   Awesome.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   They do these amazing things with it.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.640]   There's the activity stream on the right.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.960]   There's the activity stream on the right.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.640]   You can see this is kind of amazing.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.080]   These are the bugs that are created versus the bugs resolved.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.080]   Isn't that good?
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.080]   That's good.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.080]   That's good.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.720]   And then it shows off the known issues.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.040]   Is this something Mojang uses?
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.440]   Yeah, this is something Mojang uses.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.520]   The creators of Minecraft.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.840]   There's lots of really nice features like you can merge.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.920]   If one topic is posted, and then it's posted a second time by another user who didn't realize
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.120]   it was already posted, you can merge topics.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.880]   You can easily add screenshots and crash reports, and there's comment history and
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.560]   you can close and open tickets.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.560]   It's just amazing.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.560]   I have no idea.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.200]   Is that funny that you've been using it?
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   I've been using it for years, and I had no idea that this was...
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.760]   And I kept thinking, "Gosh, this is such a good system.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.520]   Whoever built this system is so good."
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.960]   It was Jira this whole time, Atlassian.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.640]   And what's nice is I'm sure Mojang has added to it.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.440]   They have REST APIs that make it very easy to add some specifics to your situation.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.840]   It's flexible, simple, easy enough for a five person startup.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.080]   But reliable enough for 100,000 people.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.240]   That's why NASA uses it.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.520]   70% of the Fortune 100 use it.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.000]   25,000 companies, apparently including Mojang.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.440]   If you haven't tried, Jira, you can now go to Atlassian, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com/Twit
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.960]   for more information.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.360]   Monthly plans very affordable as little as $10 a month for up to 10 users, but we've
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.080]   got it free for 30 days.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.760]   I think you'll be pleased.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.280]   Systems make such a difference in large projects.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.800]   If it's just you, you don't need it.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:06.720]   But if you've got a team at Atlassian.com/Twit, try it for free 30 days.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.160]   We thank them for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:15.320]   They obviously feel that many big thinkers are watching this show.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   That's good news.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.520]   Okay, we're not going to talk about net neutrality.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   It's screwed.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   We're screwed.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   It's over.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.320]   No, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.960]   We'll find out.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:36.320]   You expected to see the Microsoft board change to a little bit to reflect such and Adela's
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   goals for the company.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.600]   Google's doing a little bit of that.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:43.360]   I see that Alan Malali, who just left as CEO of Ford, one of the most respected CEOs in
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:50.240]   the US, truly a genius who not only, I think, turned Ford around, made sure it was protected.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.440]   They never took government loans when all the other big threes did.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.320]   They don't have the problems that GM's going through right now.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.440]   Malali retired as CEO.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:04.440]   He was for a briefly considered or at least mentioned as considered to be CEO of Microsoft.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.440]   I don't think that was ever in the cards.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:10.560]   He really wanted, I think, to have some time and wanted to be with his family.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:14.200]   But he has taken a job as a Google director.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.600]   He's going to be on the board of Google.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.200]   In fact, I was looking at the Google board of directors.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   There's an example of a company that has created a board of directors that very much
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:26.680]   signify the direction the company's interested.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.840]   Of course, Larry and Sergey, the founders, are on it.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.040]   As is Eric Schmidt, he's the chairman.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.440]   John Doar, investor, and I think probably as part of the investment, they got the seat.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:44.120]   Diane Green, who founded VMware, so there's your cloud and your software folks.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:49.000]   John Hennessey, who's his president at Stanford, there's actually two academics on the board,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.160]   president of Princeton as well as on the board.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.720]   And then Paul Odellini, formerly CEO of Intel, is on the board.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.240]   This is all Google.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.160]   Ann Mather is on the board.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.600]   She worked at Shutterfly.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.880]   She worked at Netflix.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.160]   You've got a board that really reflects kind of all.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:17.200]   She's in Malawi going on the board is of course automotive, all of the interests that Google
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.320]   has.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:24.560]   Former Amazon guy, Ram Shuram.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.800]   Right now, Microsoft's board is really kind of a hodgepodge.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:32.760]   You've got Ken Thompson's very active, former IBM guy, and you've got Bill Gates.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.880]   You've got Steve Ballmer.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.320]   You've got Sachin Adela.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:40.040]   And the rest almost seem like just kind of placeholders.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:45.360]   I can imagine a reinvigorated Microsoft board that would not only help the stock market
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:51.040]   understand what Microsoft's up to, but help Sachin Adela forge his vision.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.040]   I don't know where I'm going with that.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.600]   It's not the most attractive job in the world though.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:55.600]   You know what?
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.120]   You get a lot of money, don't you?
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.120]   So you do.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.120]   It's the money.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.760]   Most people who are considered these positions don't need the money.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   It's prestigious.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   That is the key.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.000]   Hey, I'll volunteer.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   I could help.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.240]   Well, the interesting piece on the Microsoft board is they have the value act.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.320]   Yes, the activist investors got a seat.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:18.320]   Right.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.920]   That'll be interesting to see how that plays out.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:27.640]   But I think the Bill Gates question I think is still out there.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:32.960]   I mean, obviously he was going to be more involved under the Della.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.520]   I haven't heard much about the stuff.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.960]   The evidence that Bill is advising Sachin Adela at all.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.960]   At all.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:50.320]   Well, I mean, I've heard he's been on campus more frequently than I did hear that more,
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.880]   you know, a few months ago.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.360]   I don't know if that's continued to be the case or not.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.040]   But in general, Microsoft's board will probably always be weak as long as he is on it.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.040]   Sure.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.360]   Because if Bill stands up and says, no, we're going to do this.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.360]   We're going to listen.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:09.520]   And the thing to do with Google is they're bored.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.680]   They're bored.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:15.880]   Their board is way weaker because they can't actually do anything because the way Google's
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:23.600]   shares corporate governance is set up, you know, a surjay and Larry Page and Eric Schmidt
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.080]   have complete control.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.080]   Oh, really?
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:33.160]   So the board is really just a, they're there, but they can't actually do anything.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:38.120]   But Facebook is the same way, which is it's very, it's interesting for lots of reasons.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.640]   A lot of people, obviously a lot of people on Wall Street and finance are very concerned
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.120]   about it.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.880]   But there's obviously pluses and minuses.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:52.000]   Yeah, I would think, I mean, if at least you use the board, even if they have no literal
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.520]   power for in an advisory capability, you've got very smart people.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.680]   So I think you're, I think you're, I think you're at else the Google board is spot on.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.520]   Pressing is all leaning man.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:06.120]   I mean, these are good people and they could be very helpful in guiding you, even if you,
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:10.160]   even if you Larry Page are making all the decisions.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.640]   And that's also a much more attractive job.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.880]   You're on, you're on a, you're on a company that's going in the right direction.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.880]   Right.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.320]   So there's, there's a lot, there's not much pressure.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.320]   Right.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.560]   Apple has teamed up with IBM.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:30.240]   I, you know, I got to find the picture of Steve Jobs flipping off the IBM sign back in
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   the early days.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.400]   Here's the, here's the image.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.240]   He, he very famously, when he was, they were just starting out.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.440]   They were young.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.320]   They were, they were full of vim and vigor.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:47.640]   He went to the IBM building, I think in New York and very famously flipped it off.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:53.120]   In fact, for many years, IBM was the hated evil empire that they, in the 1984 commercial
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:55:01.000]   was pretty obvious who the woman holding the hammer was throwing it at, it was IBM.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.240]   Well things have changed a little bit in the modern era.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:09.320]   IBM and an apple are teaming up for a huge enterprise push.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:14.920]   Ben, I figured you'd understand, is this a big deal or is this just a PR material?
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.200]   No, this is a huge deal and it's a really brilliant deal.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:22.040]   It really came out of what field I think as far.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.200]   I mean, I haven't heard anyone talking about this previously.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:31.640]   The first, the reason it's a big deal is, I mean, my apple is kind of succeeding in
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:36.240]   the enterprise in a way that they never have, almost by accident right now.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:41.200]   They have done work on the product side for iOS to make it work well, you know, work well
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:45.240]   in the enterprise, especially in iOS 8 has quite a bit, for the first time, iOS 8 actually
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:50.120]   had a, or the WWC keynote had a section devoted to the enterprise.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.800]   So, seriously, they have a slide, you know, they actually like, they spend a little bit
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.320]   of time talking about it.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.160]   So, and obviously it's a very big market.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:06.360]   I mean, Blackberry has traditionally dominated it, but iOS is kind of like becoming the default
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   device there.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.600]   So, from that perspective, they're well shaped from a product perspective, but what Microsoft
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.760]   knows and it's good at, and what lots of enterprise companies know aren't good at,
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:19.360]   why it's hard to build enterprise company, is that enterprise is, the product is one
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.040]   very small piece of the whole puzzle.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:27.120]   It's the support, it's the, especially support, it's the working with IT, it's developing
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:31.040]   needs, it's developing all the applications that are specific to the enterprise, it's
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.520]   working with their systems, with their backend systems, with their cloud, whatever it might
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.520]   be.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.720]   And all that is messy and it's dirty and you go in, you listen to the customer and you
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.240]   tell them what they want to hear and you respond to their needs.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:48.200]   And it's very, very counter to Apple's philosophy and way of developing products.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.800]   And this is why Apple has always kind of disdain the enterprise, not because there's not money,
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:59.520]   there's a ton of money there, but because it would poison the sort of culture that they
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.680]   have around building the best possible products.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.720]   Well, in some ways, it was also the enterprise-destained Apple, right?
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.720]   Well, absolutely.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.040]   I mean, and for a good reason.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:14.720]   I mean, there was mutual hatred on both sides and both well deserved to be perfectly frank.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:20.600]   And now what Apple's basically getting is IBM is going to do all that.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   They don't need to develop that.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.080]   They don't need to develop all that messiness and worrying about it.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:30.120]   And I would imagine from IBM's perspective, actually, IBM is probably getting a very good
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   deal out of this.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:35.920]   Like, I would imagine Apple's going to go get the device money, which is all they ever
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.880]   kind of really want in the end anyway.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:42.400]   And they might get a little bit extra for support, but IBM, that IBM, you know, in an
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.600]   enterprise deal, the product is only a small part of the total cost.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.800]   Like, the whole service on top of that is where most of the money is made.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.320]   And so I would imagine for both companies, it's a massive win-win.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.280]   Apple can sell much more effectively, way more devices.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:06.480]   And IBM has a marquee product to kind of base their enterprise strategy around.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.960]   It's a brilliant deal.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:11.400]   It's very hard to see any sort of downside to it, to be perfectly honest.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:17.680]   It's not the first time IBM and Apple have worked together, though, that they go back
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.720]   to the PowerPC, the intelligent project, things like that.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:26.200]   But Apple was a lot smaller in those periods.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.200]   So that's a good point.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.200]   I mean, pink, the whole IBM.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.760]   By the way, which never emerged.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.960]   No, it was a classic vaporware.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:41.720]   There was a joke in the '90s when people were talking seriously about Apple and IBM, and
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:46.960]   at one point there was a rumor that IBM was going to buy Apple.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.400]   And I remember that.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.000]   So there was a riddle that came out of that, which was, "What do you get when you combine
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.680]   Apple and IBM?"
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.840]   And the answer was IBM.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:59.520]   Well, that would change today, wouldn't it?
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.360]   It sure would.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:09.640]   So the difference is those both PowerPC and Intelligent were products, and they were working
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.360]   jointly on a product.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.520]   In this case, the lines of division are very, very clear.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.040]   Apple provides the product, and IBM provides the service.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:26.040]   And because IBM doesn't really build products anymore, and so to me that gives the partnership
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.560]   a much greater chance of success.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:33.280]   I mean, going back to incentives, the incentives are very well aligned for this, and that's
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.080]   kind of the key to making a sort of partnership work well.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:42.160]   I'm pretty sure IBM will end up getting some small cut of the hardware price, too, but
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.960]   it's probably a smart deal for both companies.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.520]   Is it targeted against Microsoft or Google or both?
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.520]   Yes.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:57.800]   Microsoft has a very compelling mobile enterprise strategy.
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:04.480]   I mean, if you're in the enterprise already, you love Microsoft, and it seems like with
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:11.000]   Windows Phone, there's a pretty nice unified platform there.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   You don't actually.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   They don't.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.120]   The most recent version has kind of added some basics.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.400]   Some must have some comes to enterprise, but they've been way behind iOS.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400]   Interesting.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   When it comes to enterprise support.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.240]   I was just assuming that they would pay attention to enterprise.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.000]   It's such a big part of Microsoft's business.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.960]   Well, Windows Mobile was, for sure.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:37.640]   But Windows Phone, they reset, and it was a very explicit sort of consumer product.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:43.320]   And to my mind, that was really where they, that was kind of a nail in the coffin for
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320]   the whole thing.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:51.680]   Had they kind of granted Apple and Android the consumer space then and said, "Okay, well,
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:58.800]   the ship sells 2010, we are going to be the enterprise phone takeover of a Blackberry."
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.080]   That would be a smart move.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.960]   Yeah, I think they'd have a much more, they'd be in a much stronger position.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.640]   Clearly iOS has taken over for Blackberry, not because it's got such a great enterprise
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.040]   story, but just because that's what the users wanted.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.840]   BYOD, they brought their own device into enterprise and it was always an iPhone.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.480]   It has the best enterprise support of all the major platforms.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   It does.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.680]   Android has been pretty messy.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:30.120]   Samsung and others are actually doing some pretty heavy lifting to try and make Android
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.760]   more enterprise.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.120]   Samsung has Nox, which is a secure platform.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:39.400]   Although at Google I/O, Google did announce that they were going to allow you to have
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:44.760]   the mullet of phones, your Android phone will have a party in the front business in the
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.360]   back or was it the other way around?
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.040]   You'd have your business stuff and it would be separated from your personal stuff.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.840]   Which is easy to do now for all kinds of reasons, including the fact you can pack so
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.200]   much storage and do tiny device.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.640]   Interesting story coming out of hope, the Hackers on Planet Earth Conference in New
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.280]   York City this week.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.800]   A slide deck from Jonathan Zitszewski.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.920]   I hope I'm saying your name right, Jonathan.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.400]   Identifying backdoors, attack points and surveillance mechanism as an iOS.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.800]   We had talked quite a bit on our security show.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:27.160]   Steve Gibson had looked into the white papers Apple had put out about security first on
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.320]   iPhone, particularly on the newest iPhones and came away quite impressed.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.320]   I don't know.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.600]   I forwarded this document to Steve.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.360]   We'll talk about it on security now on Wednesday.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:43.440]   But holy cow, if you read these power points, I guess the big takeaway from this is that
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.520]   Apple has all sorts of services.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.000]   Well, this is it.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.600]   Apple's worked hard to make iOS devices secure against typical attackers, but they've put
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:01.360]   all sorts of stuff in to allow law enforcement access to this data.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:10.200]   In fact, all iOS devices are currently running a packet sniffer that allows these devices
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:18.720]   with the appropriate software to look at everything that's going on over the network entirely.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.520]   But in fact, the iPhone is terrifying.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:28.320]   There are undocumented services that bypass encryption.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.040]   You may assume if you've got an iPhone that when you shut it off and you've got the lock
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.320]   screen on that your data is encrypted, not in fact the case.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:43.120]   If the device hasn't been rebooted, all the data that it has been encrypted can be accessed
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:51.040]   easily with all of Apple's software gives up its information completely, immediately,
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.840]   easily.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.360]   It's really kind of a surprising now.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.560]   We haven't heard Apple's response to this, but I most particularly would like to hear
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:05.800]   about this lockdown D and this packet sniffer that is apparently running.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:12.480]   I mean, PCAPD Zadarski asks, "Why do we need a packet sniffer running on 600 million personal
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.840]   iOS devices?"
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.560]   Because it's there.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.560]   It's there.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.040]   Look, all of mobile is a horror story now.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.360]   When it comes to privacy and security, it's all a horror story.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.440]   Well, I guess that's the message that those of us who thought foolishly, "Oh, Apple's
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.480]   protecting us."
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.960]   We now know that's not the case.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.960]   Is that right?
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:41.360]   I don't know why anyone trusts any of the major technology companies when it comes to things
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.800]   like this because the laws are basically against us ever finding out.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.960]   They get served with these national security letters or other secret government orders.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.400]   They can't tell us about.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:01.080]   I think they need to do a better job of fighting for us, but this is going to take a while
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.560]   to fix for sure.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.760]   This is what Jonathan says.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:10.120]   He says, "com.apple.PCAPD immediately starts LibCap on the device dumps network traffic
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:14.880]   and HTTP request and response data traveling into and out of the device.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.800]   It does not require developer mode.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.720]   It is active on every iOS device.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:25.160]   It can be targeted via Wi-Fi for remote monitoring, so you can use Wi-Fi to get into somebody's
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.240]   phone and then monitor the network with it.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.640]   There is no visual indicator to the user that the packet sniffer is running, and it's
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.320]   on every single iOS device."
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.960]   Now, again, this is Jonathan's presentation.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.160]   He is a very credible security researcher.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:47.800]   He does offer an example from iOS 7.1.2, the current version of iOS, of a hex dump that
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.120]   he got from a phone.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.760]   It's pretty terrifying.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:00.760]   You tie that with Edward Snowden's conversations most recently with Daniel Ellsberg at Hope
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.760]   X.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.200]   Hope was a good conference to go to.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200]   I missed it.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.680]   I actually was there yesterday in Friday.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.680]   It just got back.
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.960]   It's really fabulous conference.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:16.040]   Think of it as DEF CON for people with social responsibility.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.920]   It's pretty wonderful.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.600]   It was started by a manual Goldstein of 2600.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600]   Was it not?
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.600]   I believe so.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.120]   Is it still run by them?
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.320]   They're still involved.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.320]   It's a wonderful gathering.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.360]   Did you go to the Snowden event?
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.760]   I actually missed that, but nobody could get.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.320]   It was so crowded that nobody could get into it.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.320]   It was pretty popular.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.760]   Well, actually, a lot of people got into the room, but most people didn't.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.240]   Or a number of people didn't, anyway.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.800]   Snowden's been saying some interesting things.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:52.560]   I have to say, for instance, he says, "If you want privacy, don't use Dropbox.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.320]   Dropbox is the most anti-privacy of all the services."
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:02.200]   He points to the fact that Condoleezza Rice, who the former Bush official security advisor
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:09.280]   who was, he says, "very instrumental in privacy reversals during the Bush administration,
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.800]   is on the board of directors."
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.720]   He recommended an alternative, which we've recommended as well before.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.720]   Spider-Oak.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.720]   Spider-Oak.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.720]   I'll use Spider-Oak for some time.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:28.000]   Your data is encrypted prior to its transfer up to the servers.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.960]   As we know, it encrypts your data, but everybody at Dropbox has access to it.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.120]   So, I missed this paper.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.880]   I've actually been on vacation.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.720]   So you've got some reading to do, Ben.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720]   I do.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.200]   Did all, were all these...
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:50.200]   I'm a little confused by the packet sniffer on a phone thing, because I mean, the phone's
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.720]   running its own OS isn't the kind of by definition of packets different.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.480]   Is all this about having local access to the phone?
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   No.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.400]   As he points out, you get Wi-Fi access to the phone and then sniff it.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.680]   And law enforcement can turn it on.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680]   You know what?
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.440]   I am not an expert in security.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:17.760]   You might want to go to Jonathan's website, Z-D-Z-I-A-R-S-K-I.com.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.680]   He says he published this in a paper months ago, but it wasn't until he put it in PowerPoint
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:27.440]   slides at Hope that anybody even talked about it, which doesn't really surprise me.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.640]   But we're talking about it now.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:34.720]   And I think it is worth probably paying some more attention to it.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:40.320]   You know, the mobile privacy in general is such a joke because of permissions that the
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.360]   applications all demand.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:50.360]   And I've just moved my two phones to Cyanogen Mod, which is a third party, Android variant
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.600]   that has a much better privacy built in.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.280]   But I don't take for granted that even that is going to be sufficient.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:05.280]   And this is a problem that I'm not sure the market itself is going to be able to solve
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:13.320]   because in part of the concentration among a few carriers that are practically married
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.520]   to the government when it comes to push to shove.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:23.360]   So we have a big, big, difficult problem to solve here.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.680]   At least Cyanogen Mod is open source.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.160]   So presumably it could be audited.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.000]   What we learned with TrueCrypt is that people can have access to your source code.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.640]   It doesn't mean it's secure.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.400]   It just means that they have access to your source code.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.200]   And we're all, those of us who are unable to look at the source code and really truly
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.560]   vetted are all kind of just hoping somebody's doing that.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.120]   Well, the Windows version actually was still binary.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.280]   So that was always one of the issues was that the Windows version of TrueCrypt, no one really
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.000]   knew what was going on.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.960]   But even, I mean, they basically said don't trust any of them.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.160]   That's the implication.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.840]   They've given up.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:11.040]   Well, there's a project that may come together if they can find a way to do it to get the
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:17.520]   TrueCrypt Linux code and work with that for a new project.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.200]   Well, and their ownership issues.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.760]   Of course, the Johns Hopkins researcher who raised money was it on Indiegogo to do a TrueCrypt
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   audit is continuing on with his audit.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.640]   And I guess he has access to the source.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.640]   Matthew Green.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   Matthew Green.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640]   That's why they brought pride.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   There is, I think, a silver lining here though, which is law enforcement now according
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:42.120]   to the Supreme Court does need a warrant to access your phone.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:50.320]   So at least from that perspective, in all likelihood, that's going to, like this will
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.320]   be a legal protection.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.040]   Well, it helps you on the ground.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:59.400]   It helps you if you get pulled over in a traffic stop and the cop takes your phone and plugs
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.320]   it into a device and takes a data dump.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.800]   You can't do that anymore without a warrant, but it doesn't help you against the NSA in
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.800]   the least.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.800]   No.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:12.000]   And then there are these systems that are going to be in the case of the data.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.520]   That police have working in lots of places around the country to basically scarf up everything
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.880]   and fake out the tower and pretend that they're one of the cell towers.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.040]   That was one of the traffic goes.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.600]   And they're making deals with the manufacturers to keep it secret and the government's ordering
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:37.240]   the federal government has ordered several cases that the locals not tell anybody what
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.240]   they're doing.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:44.640]   And again, if we had a Congress that actually did its job, I would hope some of this stuff
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   would change.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.160]   Can we get the kid with a spoon on his eyes again?
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.160]   I'm getting the...
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.440]   Yeah, I got to read it.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   Right.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   Yeah, we need something more.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.720]   This is the most impressive one ever.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.520]   So I want to know more about Hope X.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:03.040]   I love the name Hackers on Planet Earth equals Hope.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.360]   And it sounds like it was a great conference.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.240]   So maybe you can tell us a little bit more about it than we come back.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240]   How about that?
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.880]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.240]   We're going to talk a little later on about Amazon's new Kindle Unlimited.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.000]   That's nice, but I'll tell you what, I like to listen to books.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.440]   Hint Amazon.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.240]   Right now I'm a huge fan of Audible.com.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.240]   You know that.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.480]   I have been since the turn of the century.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:34.240]   I think I got my Audible account in 2001 and I've got over 500 books in my Audible library.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.920]   It's one of the neat things about Audible.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.240]   Is that once you buy a book on Audible.com, it's yours forever.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.240]   It's in your bookshelf.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.080]   You can go back and listen to it.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.600]   150,000 titles.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.040]   They've got fiction, nonfiction.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.080]   They've got wonderful thrillers.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.760]   Mark Grissinovich's Rogue Code.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.400]   In fact, the trilogy, the Jeff A.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.440]   Contillurgy is all unaudible.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.480]   Wonderfully read by Johnny Heller, if you like.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.760]   This is kind of cyber.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.280]   This is a new style of fiction, kind of a cyber thriller.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.160]   Zero Day I think was the first one.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.520]   Trojan Horse and now the latest just came out, Rogue Code.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.160]   I'm going to tell you how you can get two books free.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.520]   That's why I mentioned Audible and maybe mentioned a few titles.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.480]   There's so many great choices.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.720]   This is one.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.520]   I keep getting recommended.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.840]   I don't know why Audible thinks I want to read the art of fermentation.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.160]   An in-depth exploration.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.560]   Actually, I can't wait.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.320]   I do want to read this book because breadmaking, beer making, a lot of what we do.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.000]   Kim Chi making involves fermentation.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   Be careful it doesn't become rancid.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.440]   Yeah, well, that's right.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   We're stewing, but we don't want to rancid.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.400]   Kids, books you bet.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.760]   Now, one of the things is nice about--
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.960]   I've got to get you in trouble for your address.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:52.800]   You already are.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:53.720]   I tell you.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.440]   No, no, no.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.480]   No rancidity here.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.760]   Just pure fermentation.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.120]   One of the great things about Audible is they have books for young adults and children too.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.560]   You might say, well, I like to read my kids.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.560]   Of course you do.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:09.280]   One of the studies have shown that kids who listen to audiobooks read faster, read earlier.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:12.240]   They want to pick up the books and look at them.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.720]   How about the wind in the willows?
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.840]   Read by Shelley Frazier, the classic Kenneth Graham book.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.400]   Oh, what a great book that was.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.200]   Little Women.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.280]   Treasure Island.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.600]   Read by Alfred Molina, the great actor Alfred Molina.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.520]   Audible has the best books, but also the best readers.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.320]   They bring these books to life.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.840]   And I think more than any movie, more than any play, more than certainly reading a novel,
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:38.000]   listening to a novel, there's something that happens.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.840]   It just comes alive in your brain.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.280]   And sometimes I'll go see a movie that I've listened to on Audible and I'll say, I already
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.520]   saw this.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.080]   And actually, it was better in my brain.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.120]   Visit Audible.com.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.120]   Pick a couple of books.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.640]   There are many to choose from.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.680]   The latest Stephen King, Mr. Mercedes, is out.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.160]   I finished some months ago, Michael Lewis's Flash Boys.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.160]   That's fascinating.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.760]   I read a lot of nonfiction and technology fiction on Audible.com.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.600]   Go to Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:10.520]   You'll be signing up for the platinum account that'll give you two books or two credits.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.600]   Most books are one credit.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.920]   Plus the Daily Digest of the New York Times of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.960]   You can cancel any time in the first 30 days.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.880]   Pay nothing, but those books will be yours to keep.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:27.840]   Where you see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes listen to the official movie novelization.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.880]   Actually there are books, there are movies like "Mash" which started as books and became
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   movies.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.480]   I've got to tell you, if you haven't read the book "Mash" and I bet you most of you
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.680]   haven't, it's great.
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.440]   If you love the movie, you'd love the book.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.080]   Hot lips, hula hand, trapper jolly.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.840]   They're all in there.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.080]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.760]   Get your two books absolutely free.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.520]   You will thank me later, I promise.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.520]   You have the gym in the car if you've got to commute.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.720]   Walk in the dog doing the dishes.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.480]   I listen to Audible all the time.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.640]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.080]   Actually, Lisa and I was kind of fun.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.080]   Listen to a book together.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.720]   We'll listen to the Martian together.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.560]   Actually, Brian Brushwood inspired that.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:10.560]   It was so much fun.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.320]   We say, "Okay, we're going to listen now when we were driving in Hawaii."
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.320]   We would listen.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.320]   It was so much fun.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.000]   So something you can do with a friend too.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.080]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.520]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.320]   Dan Gilmour is here.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   Rights for the Guardian.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:32.720]   Professor at the Cronkite School at Arizona State University where he teaches kids entrepreneurship
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.360]   and how to think for themselves.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.600]   Damn it.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.600]   DanGilmour.com.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.800]   G-I-L-L-M-O-R.com.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.680]   And you're at Dan Gilmour on the Twitter, right?
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.920]   That's right.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.360]   Also from Stretecherie Ben Thompson, great analyst.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.120]   I didn't realize you worked at Automatic.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.040]   I guess you mentioned that last time you were on.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.640]   What did you do at Automatic?
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.800]   I was working on growth and marketing type stuff.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:03.880]   So I know enough programming to work there, which is a prerequisite, but mostly working
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:09.080]   on WordPress.com specifically, helping us get more users, retaining the users that
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   we had.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.080]   I love Matt Mullen-Wig, the creator of WordPress.
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:18.040]   It's what he's done with Automatic is smart because they've got the nonprofit open source
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.600]   WordPress, but they also have the commercial side, which supports development.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:26.200]   It's a great way to keep something like that alive and vital and fluid.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.000]   Yeah, I'm the thing with WordPress.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   There's a huge community which supports the .org a lot as well.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   So I just say that because I know that Matt always hates it when it comes across that .com
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   does everything.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.440]   No, it is a real honor to work there.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.120]   And obviously, my business built on WordPress and lots of people's are.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.160]   So it's really an amazing product.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.080]   I still use WordPress for my personal blog.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.240]   I use it for several.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.200]   I admire Matt and those people a great deal.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:03.280]   They've walked the talk in ways that almost no one else has done.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:08.680]   Well, especially being in journalism, I mean, the impact of blogging generally and the
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:14.920]   fact that there are no more gatekeepers when it comes to publishing content.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:20.640]   I mean, that more than anything, I mean, along with all the infrastructural issues with journalism
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.280]   and being digital and all that sort of stuff, but that along with that, it's had such a huge
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:30.280]   impact and it really changed what it means to be published to be out there.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.840]   It's now easy to be published.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.040]   That changes it for me, that's for sure.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.800]   Well, on that note, maybe I'll mention that the Blogger Conference is coming up in San
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.800]   Jose.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:46.440]   We've got some people here in the studio audience who are here for Blogger, B-O-L-G-H-E-R-14.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.800]   Blogger always was about women bloggers, right?
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.560]   But Bloggers in general and it really is a great organization.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.000]   So when is the conference this week?
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   How exciting.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.200]   It's their 10th anniversary.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.840]   They're amazing people.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.400]   Lisa and her team, they've really done a great job.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:17.080]   Really, Lisa, Camahort Page and their team have really helped foster not only bloggers,
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:23.400]   but we, as we always say, we pay a lot of lip service to getting women into technology.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:29.520]   They've really done it without being demeaning in any way, but it's not demeaning to say that.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.560]   We don't want it to be a boys club.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.280]   That's a bad thing.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:44.640]   Amazon has decided it's going to do a Netflix for books, $10 a month.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:47.720]   It's called Kindle Unlimited.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.720]   It is launching.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.040]   I've seen it on the front page of Amazon.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.040]   I briefly considered it and then I saw that none of the books I wanted to read were part
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.080]   of it.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.560]   I mean, I like the idea, but it's not the entire Amazon bookstore.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.640]   I'm sure as long as publishers have anything to do with it, it won't be.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.640]   What do you think?
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:13.720]   The Verge says Amazon's Netflix for books might be doomed before it started.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.200]   Is this a good idea, bad idea?
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.640]   It's not the first Netflix for books.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:24.400]   Oyster books has been doing this for six months or so, maybe a year.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.760]   First, I have to do a disclosure.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.400]   I own a small amount of Amazon stock, but I have to agree with you.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.440]   I'm not going to pay for this.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:40.840]   It's too expensive for not enough.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:47.520]   I suspect and I have absolutely no knowledge or further insight into what they're doing
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:53.920]   internally, but I've got to believe they're going to end up with tiers of service like
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:05.560]   other companies and that maybe that'll be $3 or something for us in the catalog.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:12.920]   And onward, so if you want to read all self-published books, it'll be a lot cheaper than stuff.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.560]   That's how Netflix is five-month.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.560]   But they don't want to be part of it yet.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:21.600]   It's very unclear, by the way, as an author, I have to tell you, it's very unclear to me
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.120]   whether this is a good deal for me as an author.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.120]   I'm not sure.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:27.800]   Yeah, I think there's a few.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.560]   There's several problems why.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.800]   One, this is interesting and two, I don't think this particular one is going to work.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:45.240]   First off, for Amazon specifically, it doesn't seem, it's probably not the best idea to be
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.480]   breaking over the publishers and trying to extract every last pay from their pocket,
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.120]   even while you need their support to launch a new kind of service.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:58.800]   Perhaps it's part of these notorious negotiations that Amazon is undergoing with the publishers
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:04.920]   to get the support, but regardless, you need publisher support to do this.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.600]   And right now, they don't have it and I don't think it's compiling for that reason.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:13.160]   Two, though, I think this is a very interesting way where they're actually, the publishers
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:19.360]   ought to figure out someone or among themselves a way to do this because I think it is very
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.320]   compelling to have a Kindle alternative.
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:28.160]   A big problem is because they insist on DRM, the publishers do, that walks everyone into
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:33.720]   Kindle and there's no real alternative and that's why they're behind the eight ball
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:38.240]   in these negotiations and it would be very interesting to see if there could be a real
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:44.040]   alternative to Amazon to kind of break the Kindle's kind of power over ebooks by using
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.640]   this model as alternative to the Kindle model.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.480]   The problem, though, from the publisher perspective is there's a few whales in the book.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.000]   When I was at Microsoft, I worked on the publishing category for the Windows 8 store
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   and one thing you learn about the book industry is it's very much a whale sort of industry.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.760]   There are a few people that buy a ton of books.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.760]   Oh, is that true?
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   I worked on it.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.640]   When you said whale, I thought, oh, you're talking about Daniel Steele, you're talking
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.440]   about either big publishers or big authors, but you're talking about big readers?
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.240]   Yeah, no, for sure.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:21.160]   So I worked on the Kindle app for Windows 8 and a big thing was you had to test consistently
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.400]   for people that have over 10,000 titles in their library.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.720]   It was insane.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:31.600]   And again, it wasn't very many people, but there are a few people that buy multiple
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.320]   books a week.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   And these people...
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   Really?
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.320]   Or what?
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:41.440]   Yeah, there's these voracious readers that just are reading constantly and they support
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.160]   a lot of the industry.
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:48.800]   And so in particularly in reading where it's a smaller market than it is for music, for
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:54.720]   example, where everyone listens to music, a lot fewer people read books and that makes
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:00.520]   this much more fraught because if those people move to the description model, you've just
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.680]   given up a whole lot of revenue and it's not clear you're going to make it up on the other
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.680]   side.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.320]   I have a really good Netflix for books.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.920]   It's called My Public Library.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.920]   Good point.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.280]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.560]   Fortunately, most of the whales don't go to the public library.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.400]   No, because they want what they want right away.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.800]   They want to own it.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.200]   I look at this in Oyster Books and it's actually very much the same list.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.960]   Amazon's claiming 600 titles, 600,000 titles, Oyster Books, 500,000.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.280]   But if you look at the titles on one, it's very similar to the titles on another.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:39.240]   Both of them have the old but still probably valuable seven habits of highly effective
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.640]   people.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.120]   The big best sellers.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:46.360]   I was looking, the thing that I use as the litmus test is a book I'm reading now by Donna
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.240]   Tarda Pulitzer Prize winning book called The Gold Finch Neither a Store Has That.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.160]   That would be frustrating if you wanted to read the current best sellers, you wouldn't
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.880]   find it on either store.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:01.320]   In that case, in that respect, it's very much like Netflix streaming or Amazon Prime
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.320]   movies.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.320]   It's got movies.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.320]   It's got books.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.440]   It's not the ones you want to watch or read.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:14.440]   I do think it could end all end in tears, as Scotland Calling said, in the sense that
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.920]   maybe if you pay five bucks more, you'd get more.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.080]   But I wonder, I do worry about public authors.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:26.800]   Do you think Amazon really wants to basically be the publisher?
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.880]   They've already offered, for instance, and I don't think any of the publishers took them
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.880]   up on it.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.280]   They said, "Look, if we can't get a book from you, can we get a book from you?"
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.400]   We just print it and send it to our customer.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.200]   A print on demand service for publishers.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.960]   I don't know how they're taking to that.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:46.240]   Isn't Amazon just want to get the publishers out of the business entirely?
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:51.800]   No, I think Amazon sees, and they've actually been very vocal about this, they see the
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:59.920]   publishers as being dinosaurs and what's the word, something of a past era that doesn't
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:04.040]   need to exist in the relic of a past era.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.760]   And there's reasons to be sympathetic to that.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:14.200]   I mentioned briefly the whole upheaval in publishing that blogs have done.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:19.840]   You could argue there's no reason e-books shouldn't have a similar effect.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.840]   I think that's where you're going to watch.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:29.520]   You can question questions on DRM around all the sort of issues that go into digital.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.760]   You can see Amazon's point in a way.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.080]   Then again, Dan might have a different view.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.080]   I'm not a producer.
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.240]   How do authors feel about that, Dan?
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.720]   It depends what author you talk to.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:49.160]   The ones who are the big selling ones, they're going to stick with what works for them very
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:53.120]   well, which is the traditional model.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:27:00.880]   But the economics of it have stopped making sense for all kinds of reasons.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:09.320]   The whole idea that we should all as authors be forced through this orifice of five big
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:18.800]   publishing companies that increasingly are indifferent to the finding of excellence as
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.200]   opposed to things that will sell.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.760]   I'm just ready for some big changes.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:35.120]   The fact that Amazon took such a giant market share has a lot more to do with the publishing
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:41.080]   industry letting it happen without having any counter response at all and certainly
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:48.200]   fighting it every step of the way at one hand and then working with it on another.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:54.600]   They have the same schizophrenic response the music industry had.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:02.680]   Yeah, and the production costs, there's different costs in publishing than in music, but there's
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.160]   some similarities.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:13.120]   Again, I'm not a typical author partly because I put my workout under Creative Commons licenses
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.920]   so that people can download them anyway.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:23.440]   By the way, that does not hurt sales, which people think is counterintuitive, but it's
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.440]   not.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:32.680]   There's a whole new ecosystem emerging that we're still just getting glimmerings of.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:40.800]   I think my hope is that Amazon will not dominate it as much as they've dominated so far because
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.600]   that's just not healthy.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:52.440]   Jerry Purnell loves Amazon and loves eBooks, but he's an author who has a vast back catalog.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.160]   And for him, he's a long tail author, I guess.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.080]   For him, something like Amazon is a boon because no bookstore is going to carry all
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.280]   of Jerry's books.
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.720]   Actually, they might.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.440]   Well, it's a gatekeeper thing, though, too.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.040]   If you're already a published author, you're already in the club.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.040]   Right.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.120]   So of course, you would love to see the club continue.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.560]   I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.920]   Once upon a time, I wanted to be like a columnist for the New York Times, right?
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.760]   That was the call.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:24.160]   I didn't want to be put in my, you know, no offense to the journalists in the room, but
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:30.160]   I wanted to put in my years of being, you know, covering City Hall and covering school
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.000]   meetings like that.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   Right.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.480]   And what's so marvelous about the web and about blogs and all this sort of stuff is
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.000]   I don't need to ask permission.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.160]   I can start something up and nothing is granted to me.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.560]   I need to earn an audience.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.520]   I need to earn people trusting me and then not just to read, but then to also like give
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.800]   me my, I don't have to ask anyone permission to do it.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.720]   And that's what's potentially exciting about eBooks as well is we can get to an area where
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:02.120]   an author can sell himself and yes, authors, some authors who are happy with the current
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:05.080]   system, of course, they don't want to do that because they don't want to do the work.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:08.000]   Just like a lot of journalists don't want to do all the social media stuff because they
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.680]   just want to do their work, but that's not the world anymore.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:19.360]   But you don't need permission to write something increasingly, though you need access to the
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:26.200]   new form of distribution, which is not manufacturing and putting in trucks, but rather having people
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.200]   know it's there.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:31.640]   That's harder and harder to do.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:40.920]   And that's one issue and I worry a lot about that in the net neutrality ballpark.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:46.680]   But the thing that really is poisonous right now, I think in publishing when it comes to
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:54.280]   eBooks is the incompatibility by design of all the formats and the fact that these guys
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:31:01.600]   all want to, or at least they give the appearance of all wanting to own the ecosystem for themselves.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:09.200]   And there's resonance there with some of this control stuff that we're seeing in other parts
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:14.920]   of the tech and communications ecosystems and we really need to fix this.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.840]   No, that's the way the publishers, right, is the publishers have given Amazon the Hamworth,
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.240]   which they're being hit by insisting on DRM.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:30.400]   If there were no DRM for eBooks, Amazon would have a whole lot.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:37.120]   They would still have the actual hardcover book power because they're such a huge distributor,
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:41.960]   but they would have one of their arms tied behind their back as it were, which is--
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.000]   But it's more than just DRM.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:52.120]   It's not just DRM, it's the part of it's the file format that sometimes are--
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:58.120]   Well, you know from Microsoft, they're difficult to translate, but there's a lot of books you
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:06.280]   can buy on Amazon Kindle now that are not DRM, but you can't read their mobile in anything else.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:13.920]   So if we had some standard formats, then we do have a few standards.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:18.560]   The problem is they're not great yet at working in a variety of devices.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:24.960]   And if the big publishers were smart, they would be doing--
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:30.280]   They'd get together to do their own things, but also continue to work with Amazon.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:35.680]   Some day when we have more time, Dan, I'll ask you about the mobile format because obviously
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:40.640]   you know the insides and outs pretty well, having written a computer.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.440]   I think Dan's point is well taken in the standard.
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.440]   There's no standard.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:50.760]   Right, and even if you could totally see Amazon following the Microsoft route, where office
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:55.720]   documents are now an open standard, they're certified as such, but no one can actually
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.120]   implement them the way that Microsoft is.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.640]   Is EPUB the way it should be?
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.920]   Is that the standard we should all be adhering to?
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.720]   Is that good enough?
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.200]   The new one's pretty good.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.440]   It's getting better.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.560]   And that's the open Ebook standard, right?
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:16.800]   There's some better and better tools for creating electronic documents.
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.200]   I'm optimistic about this.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.760]   I really think it's going to come together.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:24.640]   I have in my hands a box which could have contained a fire phone, but doesn't.
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:28.240]   At the end of the week, Amazon's first phone will come out.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.040]   Something Amazon has been working on for years was rumored to be working on for years.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.680]   In fact, that rumor is true.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.800]   The fire phone, I presume neither of you have seen one nor have I because while I did get
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.080]   a box, it was empty.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.600]   Adventures and packaging.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.920]   Weird, isn't it?
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.480]   I wonder is this just a me too?
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:57.000]   Is this like the fire TV, just something that Amazon's keeping?
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   It's a placeholder.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.120]   Keep Amazon in the game or is this a game changer?
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.320]   Well, I don't think anyone's going to say it's a game changer.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:08.000]   No, it's another phone.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:19.440]   I think the charitable description of it is it's a way to get more out of prime buyers.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:22.640]   It's for Amazon's fans and the other thing is that it's an experiment and they're figuring
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:28.040]   it out until they can innovate in more interesting ways, particularly when it comes to pricing
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.160]   and things like that.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.560]   The problem that I have is actually very similar to Microsoft One in that I think it's problematic
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.320]   for Amazon.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.120]   And instead of perspective, the last thing they needed to do was worry about supporting
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:45.920]   a device ecosystem that has a fraction of the market when they need, when their bread
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:49.520]   and butter needs to be killer on all the platforms.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.440]   Like fire is a firebug or a firefly?
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:53.440]   Firefly.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.440]   That's kind of cool.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.680]   You have a button on the side of the phone, you push it, it will scan, take a picture of
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.680]   whatever you're looking at and give you information about it, whether it's a Wikipedia article
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.840]   or how to buy a cheaper on Amazon.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.640]   It is cool and they're never going to get a button on an iPhone.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.640]   No.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:14.240]   They do have similar capability in the iOS app now, but that needs to be there on day
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.240]   one.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.080]   That's more important for the company, in my opinion.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:22.400]   We call it the show rooming button so you can go into Best Buy, get the iPhone low down
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.440]   on the product, take a picture of it and get it, go get it on Amazon.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:34.280]   I might add that if they provide that service for my current phone, I might add it, but
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.360]   would I buy the fire from?
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:38.840]   I could imagine buying that or at this point.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.320]   I think it's a shame in a way.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.960]   They're entering such a mature market.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.080]   I do think firefly school, I think Mayday's cool.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:47.080]   They're going to add the button where you get instant help, the one that they have on
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.320]   their fire tablets.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.040]   Within 15 seconds, some nice person comes on and you can ask her to marry you and it's
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.400]   great.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   That's innovative.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.200]   Except for the one time you get the Comcast wrap hoop on somebody.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.520]   That would be bad.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:07.560]   I can see you and you're not using the number one e-book service in America.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.560]   We're going to take a break.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:09.560]   A couple of final stories.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.200]   Ben Thompson's here from Stretecaree.com.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.520]   Dan Gilmore from DanGillmore.com.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.920]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.520]   It's an amazing platform.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.960]   It does all the hosting, but also the software.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.480]   If you're going to start your blog, I want you to look at this.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:29.760]   All the software is so tightly integrated in hosting that you get a very responsive site.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.960]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.560]   No matter how many millions of people visit, all at the same time.
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.240]   The software is state of the art.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:42.480]   So you're going to get, without knowing any code, without knowing CSS or JavaScript or
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:46.720]   HTML, you're going to get any one of these 25 templates, something that you completely
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.560]   customize, make your own.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.640]   It's a mobile responsive.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.120]   That means it's going to look great on any size screen.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.920]   You don't have a separate mobile site.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:58.880]   It's just your site looks great on any size screen from iPhone to a 30 inch display.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:03.240]   Every site, every template, it has commerce built in, even at $8 a month.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:08.680]   Now, the $8 a month plan, which is their basic plan, allows you to take a donation, which
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.920]   would be very handy for your new blog.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:16.600]   If you're a nonprofit, take charity donations, you could do a fundraiser for a school or a
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.520]   nonprofit on a Squarespace site.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.040]   In fact, you get these sites for free for two weeks.
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:27.920]   You know what a lot of people do as a wedding gift or as a baby gift, is they create a
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.760]   Squarespace site.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.120]   When you register for a year, you get the domain name and $8 a month, it's very affordable.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:39.880]   Design a beautiful site for the new baby and then you give that to the new parents.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:45.600]   Say, I've registered your child's name on the internet, so we'll have that forever.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.560]   Here's that beautiful baby site for you.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.240]   There's so much you could do with Squarespace.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.240]   Try it today.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.520]   Just go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button.

[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.840]   You've got two weeks to use it.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:02.920]   If you decide to buy all I ask is you use our offer code TWIT, you'll get 10% off.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.520]   Just as a way to let them know, you heard about it on Twitter and a way for you to save
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.000]   a little bit of money.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:15.680]   For nonprofits, for blogs, for photo, this is really state of the art gorgeous.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.080]   By the way, the best support in the world, 24/7 from their offices in New York City,
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:25.480]   they've got a Squarespace, newly redesigned Squarespace Help site.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:29.200]   For articles, video, workshops, webinars, everything you could want.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.800]   So you're never at a loss.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.160]   If you are a developer, if you know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, they have a very nice developer
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.680]   platform too, which means you could actually have a business, a consulting business, setting
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.760]   up squarespace sites for people.
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.440]   squarespace.com, they take care of the hosting, they take care of the software, they give
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.920]   you a beautiful site.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.920]   Use the offer code TWIT and you'll get 10% off.
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.160]   But you don't have to worry about that.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.200]   Just try it free, no credit card needed at squarespace.com, just press the get started
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:57.200]   button.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.640]   Speaking of Netflix, hey, good news, Netflix now has a private surfing button.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:07.920]   So I can watch my little pony videos and not get busted.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:14.920]   You know, it's been a problem because you watch one my little pony movie and that's
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.800]   all they recommend now.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.760]   It's kind of embarrassing.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:19.760]   It was only a matter of time.
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:23.160]   I think it's kind of a good idea.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:26.040]   They won't necessarily be on your Netflix account right now.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:33.400]   They're rolling it out, testing it, but a private viewing mode on Netflix.
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.760]   Everybody wants a little privacy.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.400]   Yes, I'm a brony.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:48.240]   I think I think there's lots of ways you could take this piece of news.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.800]   But I think it is for anything that depends on a recommendation algorithm, I think this
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:40:00.680]   is particularly particularly welcome, although perhaps there's there's some funny thing about
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.680]   recommendation, recommendation algorithms, how they, you know, they tend to know you what
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.680]   you say you're interested in.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:06.680]   It tends to be very different.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.680]   You're actually interested in it.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:09.680]   It goes way back to.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:10.680]   I wonder.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.440]   Remember the thumbs up thumbs down in the article.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:19.720]   The thing that my Tivo thinks I'm gay and it kept because I have the modern, you know,
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:23.080]   Tivo Romeo Pro or whatever it is, and it records.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:24.080]   It's such a big hard drive.
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:31.480]   It records like like daily, every day, 20 new shows based on what it thinks you want.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:35.040]   I actually had to take the Spanish language channels off the channel guide because it
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.720]   kept recording shows in Spanish for me for some reason.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.120]   I don't know.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:42.320]   I don't understand.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.320]   So you're right.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.320]   Recommendation and thinking.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.320]   They've got, it's the dancing.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.640]   I shouldn't dance in front of my Xbox one.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.240]   It's sending that information back.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.080]   I got to ask who is this private from?
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.040]   Ah.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:01.160]   Clearly Netflix knows what you're watching anyway, right?
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:08.520]   And is this like private from your spouse and kids or what?
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:12.920]   I wasn't clear on what that gets you.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.920]   That's a very good point.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:17.200]   I guess it's private from the recommendation engine and that's that.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.960]   Well, that has value.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.560]   It doesn't go in your log.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:22.560]   So you're right.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.560]   It's mostly, you know what?
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.560]   You're right.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560]   It's not private from Netflix.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:26.560]   It's not private from the NSA.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.160]   It's only private from your wife.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.160]   That's who it's private.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:34.040]   It's actually a point to think about like the cheapening of the word private.
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.040]   Like what does, what does private.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.040]   Right.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.080]   Because there's lots of things.
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:44.160]   I think Chrome has a private browsing mode and we certainly know that nothing Google related
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.360]   whatever would be private.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.360]   Right.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.360]   So that's the real point.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:53.200]   You really think if I go into incognito mode that it's sending data back to Google anyway?
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.200]   Courses is.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.200]   Oh.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.200]   They say it is.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:01.080]   They don't promise anything except that it won't show up in the history.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:04.640]   So really private means private from your spouse.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.640]   In every case.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.480]   I think it won't record any history.
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:10.480]   It won't.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.320]   I don't know if it'll save cookies.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:21.920]   I mean, you know, sort of basic privacy in the instance in the browser from someone with
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.360]   access to your computer.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.320]   But I don't think anything more than that.
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.320]   Right.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.800]   Rupert Murdoch put time Warner in play.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.880]   I think he just does it for fun.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:39.520]   He did $80 billion on Wednesday to buy Time Warner the content side of Time Warner.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:43.280]   He wasn't bidding for the cable company.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.960]   Time Warner seems to have rebuffed that.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:57.040]   But now that has put them in play with a lot of other companies including ESPN Warner Brothers.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.360]   I think the why was it.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:06.280]   I wanted to spend off time which is all the print publications which Murdoch just also
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.280]   did.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.840]   Well, nobody wants to be in front of me.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:09.840]   But off from.
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:13.600]   If you're smart, you're not buying magazines these days.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.600]   Right.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.880]   But I think you mentioned ESPN.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:24.080]   I think the what's interesting about this is Time Warner has a decent sports portfolio.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.880]   And that's something that.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:31.000]   It's very interesting in developing started Fox Sports one.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.600]   It's not doing very well.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.800]   And I think that has a lot to do.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.280]   If you look at the fans, I mean, it's been dry like 50% of Disney's profits.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:46.000]   I mean, it's incredibly lucrative and very resistant to a lot of the quote unquote disrupts
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.400]   the things when it comes to television because it's why it commands a big premium.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:57.520]   But no, it's that whole arena is certainly interesting for that for that reason.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:00.360]   I should say to Warner Brothers did not put in a bid to buy Time Warner.
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:04.040]   That would be weird since they are owned by Time Warner.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:07.440]   That was a miss I miss stated.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.120]   Dell is accepting Bitcoin for online purchases.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:12.840]   Is this just this is just publicity, right?
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.560]   Because they immediately cash it in for for American dollars.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.640]   Or is there something here?
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:19.880]   Is there something going on?
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:24.880]   You can buy your Alienware gaming machine with your Bitcoin.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:29.800]   Yeah, I mean, I'm actually I'm aiming to support Bitcoin.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:32.520]   As soon as I can, why not?
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:33.760]   We take Bitcoin donations.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.600]   I have 7.6 Bitcoins right now.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.640]   Thanks to our listening audience who gives.
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:43.320]   Well, I mean, I would I would do the same thing where it converts instantly to cash.
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:48.600]   I mean, if people if people want to pay in it, by all means, I think probably the more
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:55.040]   interesting Bitcoin news is is getting into things like 51% attacks and stuff or potential
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.120]   and things like those those natures.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.880]   But as far as I think companies supporting it, you got to write things mostly.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:03.040]   It's good PR.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.120]   They get it on our current bottom.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.120]   Right.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:09.680]   And and just immediately turn the dollars.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.840]   But I don't think it's just PR.
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:13.080]   I think they're there.
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:14.880]   I think that's probably a large part of it.
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:21.920]   But the it's really worth it for these companies to be learning what they can about the new
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:24.040]   forms of currency that are coming along.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:31.320]   And more than that, the Bitcoin story I'm increasingly convinced is not about currency
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:40.160]   but about the protocols and what they're doing is pretty stunning when you look deeper
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.640]   into what Bitcoin means.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:47.520]   And I'm just I'm saying this without sufficient depth on it.
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:55.880]   I'm studying this hard now and I've become convinced that Bitcoin is a huge thing not
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:01.680]   in so much because of the currency but because of the architecture that I think this is profound
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:04.160]   and important.
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.160]   I agree.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:06.160]   I completely agree.
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:11.360]   And it is worth noting, by the way, that from Dell's perspective, I mean the the well
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:17.000]   the the lowward fees are make a huge difference.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.160]   I mean, I have to take the nothing credit card fees to appreciate that.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.040]   What is Coinbase an answer benefit to this as well?
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.040]   What does Coinbase take?
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.560]   Because basically what happens is I think the transaction goes through Coinbase.
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.960]   They turn it into US dollars immediately.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.880]   But you're saying they take less than a credit card company would.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.440]   Oh, yes, significantly.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.800]   I mean, obviously Bitcoin theoretically could be free usually to get a process in a timely
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.800]   way.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:48.400]   You pay you could pay a very small fee but relative to credit card, which is a few percent.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:53.160]   It's practically zero.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:58.240]   Who's your carrier been because you're slowly fading into the sunset?
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.040]   I'm in Madison, so it's charter cable.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.640]   Charter.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:06.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.120]   I think this would be a good time to wrap it up.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.560]   I'm just looking to see if there's any other, you know, really huge story.
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.600]   I guess there was one question I had for you, Dan Gilmore.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.320]   Did Newsweek ever recant?
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:23.880]   It's a cover story about discovering the creator of Bitcoin hiding in plain sight in
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.960]   Los Angeles.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:28.480]   I think everybody pretty much agrees that was not Satoshi Nakamoto.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:31.240]   They found a great question.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:32.760]   I have no idea.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:35.160]   I just hope nobody brings it up again.
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.960]   You should ask every week.
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.880]   Hey, Newsweek, is it still Satoshi?
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.880]   Is that still Satoshi?
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:43.880]   Is it?
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.720]   Well, I think Satoshi Nakamoto is not the...
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:48.720]   It's A-S-A-S-A.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:51.360]   We never said it was these Satoshi Nakamoto.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:54.760]   Just some guy named Satoshi Nakamoto.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:01.000]   I mean, this was when Newsweek in March went back to the newsstands where they had stopped
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.960]   publishing paper issues.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.480]   The first paper edition in a long time, they had a cover story.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:12.520]   The face behind Bitcoin, Liam McGrath Goodman wrote the story, said she has sources news.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:16.480]   The newsweek said, "We stand by this story."
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:18.240]   And at this point, it's pretty obvious.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.920]   Yeah, they got it wrong, completely wrong.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:24.200]   But nobody's just going to mention it.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.280]   That's it.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:26.280]   We don't...
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.280]   I think the...
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.360]   March is so off the news cycle now, we don't care anymore.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.800]   Plus, that newsweek is in particular important.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:40.760]   I think it means you could say anything you won if you could survive a few months.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.600]   You go unscathed.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   Let's see where it is in Google.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.440]   Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.440]   yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440]   yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440]   yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:49:05.480]   Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:10.480]   yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:13.400]   yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:17.400]   yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.640]   go down there physically one week a month.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:25.400]   Awesome, like I said, it's nice to have professors who actually come from the real world,
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:30.920]   so they're very fortunate to have you, it's also great to have you. Ben Thompson, one of the best
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:37.240]   analysts out there, his blog is free to read, Stratecary, but he also has a paid newsletter,
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:42.920]   and you can find out more at the website Stratecary, and how's the podcast going? Last time we had
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:48.680]   you on, you just launched it, is it going well? It's going very well, with James Alworth,
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:54.440]   a fellow from, from, from, from, he was at Harvard, he's worked with the Christians in
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:00.920]   now, now works for a startup in the Valley. Oh, I love like, we've had him on triangulation,
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:07.240]   Clay's really fascinating fella. Yeah, yeah, we spent a lot on talking about more,
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:12.360]   the impact of tech on society, most of them theoretical stuff, we spent quite a bit
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:15.960]   time, the last few ups, those actually, you know, there's all that debate about disruption and,
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:23.080]   like, I'm, I'm, I agree in parts, I'm more of a skeptic, James is probably more of a defender,
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:26.440]   so I think if you're interested in any sort of that business theory sort of stuff or
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:31.720]   tech and society, definitely check it out. It's exponent, exponent.fm.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:38.040]   Exponent.fm, or you can get to it from Mr. Techery site. Thank you so much, Ben. Thank you,

[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.840]   big studio audience today. It's great to have you all just email. You don't have to, but it's
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:02.760]   nice if you email tickets at twit.tv. We'll make sure to have a chair out for you and, you know,
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:11.000]   free food, no alcohol, nothing like that. Maybe a balloon on your way. I think we have new,
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.760]   the new twit pens are here. You'll each and one of you get a pen.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:21.080]   Hey, don't forget, we're having a little bit of a party. This is our third year in the brick house.
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:28.840]   We moved in on July 24th, 2011. We're going to have a little open house coming this coming
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:34.680]   Wednesday, the 23rd, if you'd like to come by, there will be cake. If you stick around, we can
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:39.640]   put out a little cotton basement for you. You can stay. It's, and you'll get cake.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:45.480]   So please come by anytime on Wednesday. Thanks to Chad Johnson who does such a, oh,
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:51.320]   I got more to talk about. Thanks to Chad Johnson. I was going to give you a plug, Chad.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:55.800]   Thanks. Sorry. I'm thanks to Chad. Who produces the show, puts together the rundown, books,
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:52:01.320]   the guests. He is running the board right now. He does everything to make this show happen. I
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:05.160]   really appreciate it. I thought last, just the other day, I was thinking, thank goodness I've
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:09.880]   got Chad on this show. Oh, thanks, man. I can barely carry my hair and the other. He also pays attention.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:15.320]   The fact that we are doing a vote right now on our next Twitch shirt. We like to, we, I think we're
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:19.400]   going to open it. Lisa says we're going to open a regular store, but we like to do a one-off thing
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:23.800]   every month where you can get the shirt, but only for 30 days. We've got four designs we've
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:30.680]   purchased from 99 designs. And what you like you to do is to visit those designs, pick the one you
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:36.200]   like the best, and then vote for it. And we're going to have the vote go on for about a week.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:43.640]   What is the address for the straw poll? Currently. I just go to inside.tape.tv. That's our blog.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.680]   That's where you'll see the designs. And then there's a link there. We want you to see the
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:51.720]   designs before you vote, obviously. Don't show, don't, don't show the results.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:58.520]   Wait, Lisa, I'm getting, I'm getting conflicted in the results. Lisa's the boss. Show the results.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:04.840]   Okay, so far. So far. You can change. Oh, she's very close. Right now it's the brick wall that's
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:11.800]   winning. But boy, the spotlight's really close. Steam punk kind of taken up the end there.
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:17.240]   Over 1,400 votes are in. But that's not the end of the game. Yes. Vote all week long. So
[01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:22.200]   keep your votes coming in inside.tape.tv. That's a square space site. So go ahead. Everybody
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.600]   go there all at the same time. Don't all vote at the same time. That is not a square space site.
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:30.680]   Stroppole is pretty good. Because we used to be able to bring it down.
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:35.400]   As Dan, as Dan got it on the hot. Oh, yeah. I mean, they're up to let's look at how many
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.200]   stropoles. There's quite a few. Yeah, it's over two million now. That's awesome.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:43.480]   And Dierks who designed that originally for.
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:48.760]   Fairness of W. Yeah. Yeah. Now over two million stropoles created.
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.760]   Over two million stropoles served. Right.
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:55.320]   Is there any? Oh, let's see. You know, this is going to be a big week for
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:00.600]   Twit because there's a lot of results coming in the Microsoft quarterly results. Let's see. I think
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:06.920]   Mike Elgin has a rundown coming up this week and other big week for earnings. Netflix reports
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:12.440]   financial results on Monday, July 21st, Apple, Microsoft and Verizon on Tuesday, Facebook and
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:17.880]   Qualcomm get their turn Wednesday. And on Friday, July 25th, Amazon's fire phone ships
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:21.480]   last from AT&T. I hope your boss is coming up this week. Back to you, Leo.
