[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.640]   Episode 251, recorded June 6, 2010.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.480]   Flop sweat.

[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.200]   It's time for Twit, this week in tech.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   The show that covers all the latest tech news
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.000]   and kind of a young panel today making me look hip with it.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.360]   It actually could go either way.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.520]   It could make me look really old and out of it.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.560]   Starting with Mark Millian from the Los Angeles Times.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.960]   Always glad to have Mark on the show.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.960]   And you're in town today.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.720]   That's nice.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.840]   Always great to be here, especially in studio.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.000]   I asked if you were here for a WWDC,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.560]   but you haven't decided whether to go or not?
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.920]   Well, I ran into Gabe from TechMeeam and Alexia
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.280]   from SF Weekly earlier.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.840]   And our plan is to just sneak in.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.360]   Because I didn't plan in advance.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.720]   Because Apple has so little security,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.760]   shouldn't be any trouble.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   I think we'll do mission and possible style from the rafters.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.360]   Are you going to have rubber masks?
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.720]   Maybe.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.360]   I love that.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.840]   That's a good idea.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.480]   I love that when they peel off the masks.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.680]   And look, it's Martin Landau.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.840]   We thought it was Mark Millian, but it's Martin Landau.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.360]   Also here with us, glad to have you back
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.040]   at the last time I saw you.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.840]   Julio Hoeira Zapata was in January at the iPad announcement.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.320]   Correct.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.880]   You came back out to the--
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.440]   It was the first time you and I shook hands.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   That's very nice to me.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.160]   IRL.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.040]   In real life, as they say.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.600]   First time on the show, in real life, as a matter of fact.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.000]   And on the other fart on the show, so you don't know.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.280]   You get a little gray hair there.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.800]   From the St. Paul Pioneer Press and the web blog,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.720]   yourtechwebblog.com.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.960]   Good to have you, Julio.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.560]   You are out here for WWDC.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.680]   You would admit that.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.480]   All right.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.880]   Good to know.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.640]   Also with us for the first time, very glad to get him on.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.400]   I've been dying to get him on for a long time from Engagit.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.200]   He's the editor-in-chief.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.120]   He's also the host of Engagit's great gadget podcast.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.560]   Joshua Tobolsky, it's good to have you, Joshua.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.880]   Thanks for having me, good to be here.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.520]   You like Joshua, Joshua?
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.160]   You know, whatever you prefer is fine with me.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.960]   They both work.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.600]   I respond to both.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.680]   Good to have you.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   Ladies' choice.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.360]   You're in a hotel.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.640]   Where are you?
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   I am in San Francisco.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.560]   I'm a few blocks from Moscone.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.240]   Do you want my exact location?
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.840]   Well, no, I already have that on four square.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   It's OK.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.640]   No, I'm just-- so you're based in New York?
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.600]   Yeah, I'm in Brooklyn.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.640]   Well, I live in Brooklyn.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.960]   I usually work from office at home.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.280]   But we have AOL's offices in the city.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.040]   And you have the beautiful offices on the Lincoln Circle.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.920]   That's a really nice spot.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.960]   We've moved now, though.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.560]   They're all downtown.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   Oh, really?
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.840]   What about that beautiful building they built there
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.000]   with the ding and the hung and a ding?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That's not--
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.720]   I think they lost it in the divorce.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.440]   You're kidding.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.720]   So that's now Time Warner's?
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.400]   Yeah, I don't think they use that anymore.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.640]   Columbus Circle, not Lincoln's.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.400]   Columbus Circle.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.840]   But it's a beautiful building.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.120]   They just built that.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   I think I haven't been there since my initial interview
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.360]   about working at Engadget.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.080]   Oh, never mind.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.520]   Downtown's better anyway, it's Ipper.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.280]   It's cooler.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.040]   Yeah, it's much more with it.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.960]   So you're in town.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.880]   I take it for WWDC as well.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.120]   Yeah, we're going to be covering it live.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.880]   So--
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.400]   Live blocking.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.440]   Live as live as possible.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.360]   Yeah, well, you won't make the mistake I made.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.760]   And I've never been invited back.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.600]   I just picked up my laptop at the iPad announcement
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.840]   and pointed it at Steve.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.640]   I heard about this.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.000]   Yeah, he gave me the stink eye, too.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.440]   I could tell he could see me.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.840]   He probably has a button, right?
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   Like a--
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.560]   I was surprised that there wasn't an injector seat, actually.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.840]   I was surprised I didn't go flying through the ceiling.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.000]   But I do notice that I haven't been invited to an Apple
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.560]   event since.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.840]   But of course, it's only been a few months.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.440]   Time heals all wounds.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.160]   There you go.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.640]   Oh, shut up.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.200]   I was trying to be on the optimistic side.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.560]   Well, wait--
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.160]   Are you going tomorrow?
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.000]   Well, like I said, I haven't actually
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.280]   been invited to any Apple event in a while.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.480]   That might not bode well for your--
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.520]   And I don't care.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.200]   Send him for the flowers.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.680]   And no.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.280]   Steve and I, we've had this off and on love-hate relationship
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.080]   for many decades.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.360]   It's OK.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.680]   He knows I love him deeply and in spirit.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.480]   Do you think, gentlemen, gentlemen of the press--
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.880]   I've got some theories about what will happen at WWDC,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.280]   but I'm curious what you think.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.400]   I guess we all agree a new iPhone will be announced.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.280]   Oh, yes.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.480]   Hey, babe.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.960]   May, did you say maybe?
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.880]   Ever now.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.160]   You don't know, do you?
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.560]   No, I beat Sir Cass.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.480]   If I do iPhone tomorrow, something has gone horribly wrong.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.680]   Well, you know, it's true that there's such expectation
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.640]   when Steve takes the stage that if he just says,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.720]   I'm going to talk about iPhone 4, the SDK, your developers.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.320]   Let's talk a little about some of the features, the API.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.040]   Some of the hooks were building in for you developers,
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.920]   and then leaves that he would be eaten alive by the press,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   right?
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.520]   What do you--
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.640]   What do you can't do that?
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.400]   Very odd.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.840]   I mean, at this point, I think we expect it.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.560]   This is what happens at WWDC.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.440]   They're going to talk about a lot of other stuff.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.640]   Well, here's a real question.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.440]   Julio, do you think that the iPhone will be available tomorrow?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.520]   They'll announce it.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.640]   Will it be available?
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.680]   Well, I suspect they'll announce it, and then release it
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.440]   in a week or two.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.520]   A week or two?
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.020]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.080]   Joshua, what's the line on that?
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.000]   I think we've heard-- that sounds very possible.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.480]   We've heard June 20th or 27th, some dates around there.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.080]   They have booked, apparently, on the 27th.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.520]   They've booked Moscone again.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.000]   Maybe because that's odd.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.520]   It might be.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.120]   It's simply that they weren't sure when
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.600]   WWDC would be, and they were covering their bets,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.800]   because they didn't announce WWDC till kind of late.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.200]   Late.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.760]   But I agree with Julio.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.200]   I think that it's going to be not the day of.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.440]   I just don't see them doing that.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.880]   Why not?
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.760]   Well, I mean, I think they like to build a little hype.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.920]   They want people to wait in line.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.640]   And if you do it the day of, people just run into stores.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.800]   But they had the hype built for them by tech blogs, by Moto.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.880]   G, people just run into stores and buy it.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.080]   How horrible is that?
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.520]   I mean, golly.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.120]   What's better?
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.920]   They run in the stores, or they wait,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.480]   and then they have to get in line,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.800]   and then the news covers these crazy lines for the new app.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.480]   They don't wait too long, because I
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.080]   think there's things like this Sprint Evo that
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.120]   could very well eat some of their sales
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.040]   if they wait too long, don't you think?
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.920]   I think it's already happening, right?
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.240]   A lot of people are-- I mean, I've gotten emails from people
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.280]   saying, should I get this?
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.040]   I got to get this.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.200]   I can't help myself.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.080]   So the Evo I mean.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   I love the Evo.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.200]   I am loving it.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.760]   Great.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.640]   Can I tell you about the Evo?
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.880]   It's please, Julia.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.920]   Tell me about the Evo.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.960]   OK, I brought the Evo on this trip.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.480]   I did a couple of wacky things.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.400]   I didn't bring a laptop.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.480]   I only brought iPads for my activity.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.080]   I noticed that.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.760]   You're going to do the whole-- wait a minute,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.000]   now, folks, he's got two.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.640]   What's the deal with two iPads?
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.440]   Well, I'm a deeply paranoid person,
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.720]   and I'm taking a leap here.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.840]   And it's OK, iPad.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.040]   I'm trusting you, but I'm bringing two.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.760]   But I'm only trusting you a little bit.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.400]   Two, just in case you lose one.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.520]   Well, this whole 10 to 11 hour battery life--
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.560]   You're using one?
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.200]   --battery life.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.760]   --quitter, aren't you?
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.280]   No, this whole 10 to 11 hour battery life.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   I'm not seeing that.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.520]   I'm running out of juice.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.080]   I'm switching between iPads because they keep running out
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.320]   of juice.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.120]   I don't know if there are defective or something.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.640]   But if you're running on 3G, I think you'll kill them.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.600]   Yeah, that might be it.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.800]   And you're multitasking.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.480]   Somebody said that's the best way to multitask
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.560]   is by multiple iPads.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.440]   But that's what Woz does.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.400]   He had two iPhones.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.000]   I interviewed him.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.960]   He said, multitasking.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.880]   Well, I had just two iPhones.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.520]   That's how Steve would like to multitask.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.040]   Just buy more.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.960]   But the EVO, I brought the iPad for productivity.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.600]   I brought the EVO as my mission critical smartphone.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.880]   Ooh, that might have been a mistake.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.520]   And I think it's driving me nuts.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.040]   Why?
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   What don't you like?
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.240]   I don't know if it's an EVO problem or an Android problem.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.040]   But it's just the performance is really flaky,
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.760]   getting all kinds of error messages.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.920]   No, I haven't had that.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.800]   A lot of force quits.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.360]   You know, a lot of pop-ups.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.440]   I think you've got a problem.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.400]   I think you had a battle.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.120]   That might be--
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.880]   Maybe it's the saw one.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.480]   What are you running?
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.640]   Maybe it's a particular app or a collection.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   That's one thing with Android that's really true,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.480]   is that you can hose your Android by running a third party
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.040]   app that's not very good.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.480]   I've been very cautious about what apps I install
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.680]   and uninstall apps frequently, just to make sure that they're
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.280]   not--
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.720]   if I see battery life issues or that kind of thing,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.440]   are you running just the stocks?
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.600]   I'm just doing the stock stuff and it's driving me nuts.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.960]   But you know, the other thing, we're
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.840]   talking Android versus Apple.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.240]   And I just want to make a point.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.560]   I've used a lot of Android phones.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.120]   I like Android very much.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.760]   I'm a big fan of Android.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.720]   But every time I put down an Android phone
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.800]   and pick up an old-- for instance, an old iPod touch
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.400]   that I have lying around, and I start using it,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.360]   there's a fluidity to the iPhone OS
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.280]   that I have yet to see on any Android phone.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.040]   There's somebody at Apple that knows something
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.720]   that nobody else knows because the fluidity,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.120]   the ease of use of the iPhone OS is amazing.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.640]   Every time I put down an Android phone
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.840]   that I've been using for many days, pick up that iPod touch,
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.520]   I still see that difference.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.400]   That little subtle thing about Apple hardware versus Android
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   is something that Google has not nailed yet.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.840]   I hear people say that and Andy Naco says that.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.280]   And I abandoned the iPhone in January for the Nexus 1
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.360]   and have not looked back.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.840]   I have been very happy, especially now with Android 2.2
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.440]   on this thing.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.080]   It's just great.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.440]   Joshua, you use a lot of phones.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   Do you have an opinion?
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.360]   Yeah, I think some people--
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.440]   I mean, I totally know what he was saying.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.280]   I mean, I think some people are really sensitive
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.520]   that I am the fit and finish the--
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.880]   Are you saying I'm insensitive?
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.240]   Well, I mean, maybe just to this one thing,
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.920]   I do find-- every time I get a new phone,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.960]   the first thing I do is I get the icon screen up.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.360]   And I start to sort of go back and forth with my finger,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.120]   like this as quickly as possible.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.520]   Because I want to see how it's tracking, right?
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.680]   What the finger tracking is like.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.960]   And if you do it, if you compare Android to an iPhone,
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.680]   I know this sounds completely insane.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.680]   But you do see there's something in the finger tracking
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.160]   in the smoothness of the experience.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   Yeah, that looks fine.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.360]   But if I showed you side by side,
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.760]   you'd see how much lag it actually had compared to an iPhone.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.760]   The iPhone tracks to a T.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.600]   The iPhone is on a processor that's 1/3 fast.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.280]   Doesn't matter.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:28.760]   I know.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.600]   It's about-- I mean, it's about the--
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.520]   People always said that.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.480]   I have to say, people always said that in the early Macintosh
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.920]   days, and it was true that the mouse in the Macintosh
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.200]   was direct-driving on Windows.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.480]   It felt like it was a little lag.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.120]   It felt like it was floating above the actual glass, right?
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.520]   Whereas Mac, it was in the OS.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.400]   That's the way the iPhone feels to me.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.640]   And I saw I agree.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.640]   But also, I don't know if it's--
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.280]   it's sense has gotten, has made that experience a lot better.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.120]   What HTC has done?
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.600]   I do like the sense UI.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.400]   I think--
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   while I miss 2.2, which I think is significantly faster,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.280]   I do like the stuff that HTC builds in.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   What about Moto Blur?
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.400]   I haven't played with a Moto Direct.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.360]   You don't like that, Mark?
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.440]   I tried the backflip.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.000]   It's just so superfluous and just totally unnecessary.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.560]   And sense, too, I think, is an unnecessary layer
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.480]   that's added on top.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.960]   I mean, that's a slippery slope where
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.520]   you have sense built on top.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.320]   Google wants to roll out an update.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.120]   And you have to wait for HTC to be built there.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.600]   Well, that's what happened, isn't it?
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.360]   Yeah, because you can't get 2.2 on the Evo yet.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.760]   Google's going to fix that problem.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.880]   And unfortunately for HTC, with, I think,
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.880]   because they just got, you know, Matias or Matias
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.680]   do art from--
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.320]   That's right.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.680]   They snag the guy.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.120]   --with the mastermind.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.200]   The mastermind of the web OS experience.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.640]   So he's a UI guide.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.920]   So you're saying he's going to fix the Apple/Android issue.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.640]   I think there's a real possibility
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.040]   that they're looking at Android.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.240]   And they're saying, we need to bring this together.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.520]   It's very-- I mean, it's actually really inconsistent UI
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.280]   experience.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.840]   There are things that work one way here.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.800]   Oh, it's worse than that.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.560]   I mean, really, Android's biggest problem
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.600]   is that there are so many different handsets,
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.280]   different screen resolutions.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.400]   And the real bad problem, in my opinion,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.680]   is-- and I speak as somebody who talks to normal consumers--
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.480]   is that you don't have the sense when you buy an Android
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.880]   phone that you're getting--
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.280]   you may buy the Evo today as the best Android phone today.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.200]   But you really have this scary feeling
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.960]   that next month there will be a better one.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.160]   And then the month after that, there will be a better one.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.720]   And that keeps people out of the market.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.200]   And Apple knows this.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.240]   They say one year.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.840]   And you know exactly when the new iPhone's coming out.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.560]   And you don't have that sense of, oh, God, tomorrow,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.640]   there's going to be a better phone out.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.720]   Not sure I agree with that.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.400]   Like, for instance, the droid--
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.520]   I see the droid popping up in most of driving places.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.760]   A lot of people don't drool.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.360]   All my kids, school teachers, who know a lot about technology,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.400]   they're all packing droids.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.280]   It's very interesting.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.200]   But they have to look at the reviews and say, well,
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.920]   wait a minute, the incredible is better than the droid.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.160]   Oh, wait a minute, the Evo is better than the incredible.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.960]   And I think that in the long run hurts a company.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.560]   I don't think it doesn't hurt anyone--
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.120]   carrier or anyone-- cell phone company
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.760]   hurts Google as the common--
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.240]   They have a fragmentation problem.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.480]   That's definitely true.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.160]   But I think, too, on the point about the droids,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.080]   I think for a long time Verizon was a man in the desert
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.800]   who needed water.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.600]   There were no good smartphones on Verizon.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.360]   Really, your options were like, get a blackberry.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.960]   And the droid was the first real.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.360]   It was totally competitive with the iPhone,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.440]   had apps, had support of a major company behind it.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.360]   And it was a pretty attractive device.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.880]   So I think they've been selling a lot of droids.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.120]   I think the question is, do people
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.520]   know the difference between the droid
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.120]   and the droid incredible and the droid heiress?
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.040]   Or droid II, which is going to come out sometime soon, right?
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.720]   They do with these hundreds of commercials
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.040]   that have been pushing.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.480]   And the commercials are all this--
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.960]   They're all about droid.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.000]   The same product, right?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.680]   Aren't they all about the droid?
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.240]   Right, but now they're saying by the droid incredible,
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.040]   whereas the original droid is sort of passe.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.880]   They're droid incredible commercials really good.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.600]   It emphasizes the speed, the performance.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.280]   I like the commercial.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.080]   I think the incredible is a better phone.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.000]   It is a better phone.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.880]   And I think that if all those teachers who bought the droid--
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.320]   --are going to--
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.520]   --the Motorola droid are going to say, oh, wait a minute.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.360]   The incredible.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.560]   And then you start to get this backlash where people say,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.480]   well, I'm not going to buy because the better phone's
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.680]   going to be here any minute now.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.080]   Don't you think?
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.160]   Well, I'm talking a little bit on my butt here.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.880]   But--
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.320]   That's all right.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.960]   That's what we do on this show.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.160]   You're feeding right in there.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.840]   A long, long time ago, back in the Mac, two CI days or whatever,
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   if I recall correctly, my memory is sometimes a little faulty.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.160]   Macintosh refreshes did not occur as frequently
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.960]   as computer refreshes occur now.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.120]   I'm speculating here.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.440]   But my hunch is this Android juggernaut with all these
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.200]   hands that's coming out all the time
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.760]   is going to put pressure on Apple.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.640]   And who knows?
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.640]   Apple might start releasing phones every six months.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.600]   No, I don't think so.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   I think Apple is--
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.080]   see, Apple, first of all, I don't think Apple pays much
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.040]   attention to what the other guys are doing.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.240]   I think Apple has this vision.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.280]   Jobs has this vision.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.520]   And he says, I am going to do it my way.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.000]   Screw the other guys.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.840]   That's one.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.360]   Two, I think he realizes that putting out too many updates
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.240]   too fast is bad.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.840]   In fact, notice Google has already said, we're going to back
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.040]   off.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.240]   We're not going to put out Android software updates.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.080]   We're going to do yearly from now on.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.600]   I think it's vice versa, isn't it?
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.960]   Are it possibly not the frequency
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.920]   of how much improvements they make each cycle?
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.400]   Right.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.360]   Well, yeah, I think that's what you have to think about here.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.440]   And what is this phone that we're going to see tomorrow?
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.160]   I mean, here's what we know about the phone.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.040]   We've seen it.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.960]   We know what it looks like, presumably.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.040]   But we don't actually know anything about it in terms of--
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.560]   OK, let's hold that thought, Joshua.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.160]   That's great.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.280]   I want to talk about what is Apple going to announce tomorrow?
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.320]   And in particular, what does iPhone 4 or whatever we call it?
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.160]   What does that look like?
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.960]   And by the way, the unofficial Apple web
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.680]   blog has just disclaimed that picture saying, nope,
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.520]   wasn't real.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.360]   Was it funny?
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.680]   Definitely not real.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.280]   Definitely not real.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.600]   Definitely not.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.920]   So we're going to take a break, come back.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.600]   We've got a great cast of characters here.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.800]   This is a perfect bunch to talk about these issues.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.520]   Lots to talk about this week.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.800]   Mark Billion from the Los Angeles Times, Julio Ojeda Zapata,
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   from the Pi Press, as they call it, the St. Paul Pioneer
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.280]   Press, and from Engagit, the editor-in-chief, Joshua
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.360]   Tupolsky, boy, you couldn't get a more elite crew in here
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.320]   to talk about phones and more.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.440]   Before we go on, though, I do want
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.320]   to tell you about our friends at Citrix.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.520]   They do such great stuff.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.760]   And of course, their Go to Meeting program
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.640]   builds on that foundation of high quality, reliable, speedy,
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.560]   remote access to give you a way to eliminate face-to-face
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.040]   means.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.200]   I mean, you've got to have face-to-face meetings
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.720]   in business.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.760]   You've got to press the flesh.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.000]   But frankly, it's time consuming.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.560]   It's travel is expensive.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.520]   More and more, people are trying to meet via conference call.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.240]   And that's just not going to make it,
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.880]   because people are spaced out.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.520]   They're zoned out.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.800]   It's not engaging.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   Online meetings.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.480]   That's the future.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.880]   And Citrix has this great Go to Meeting product
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.320]   that's the best in the business.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.200]   I have several accounts, because believe it or not,
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.560]   we'll actually have several Go to Meetings going on at once.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.200]   And if you've got an iPad, the free Go to Meeting client
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.400]   on the iPad is killer.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.560]   It's killer.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.120]   Use Go to Meeting for product reviews, for sales presentations,
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.560]   for training sessions, for collaboration, all from your desk.

[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.720]   Now, the next time you're on a conference call,
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.680]   you say, wait a minute.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.600]   I want to show you something.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.400]   They say, what?
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.760]   You say, go to gotomeeting.com.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.160]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.840]   You can email a link, of course, ahead of time, too.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.320]   They're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.360]   They're seeing the keynote or the PowerPoint presentation.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.280]   They're seeing the spreadsheets, the drawings.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.160]   You're working together.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.960]   You're collaborating.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.720]   You're sharing desktops.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.480]   It's powerful.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.240]   It's easy.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.880]   It's fast.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.360]   And your clients or colleagues don't
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.800]   have to have it installed for them to get to a meeting.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.520]   They just go to gotomeeting.com.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.560]   You want to try this right now.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.920]   Go to meeting.com/twit.

[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.400]   I'm telling you, it'll change the way you do business.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.960]   Mark Millian, Joshua Topolsky, Julio Ojeda Zapata.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.360]   We're talking about what is going to be in the next iPhone.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.400]   I'll let you start, Joshua, because I cut you off.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.040]   Well, OK, so like I was saying, before you
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.880]   could rudely cut me off.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.320]   I'd rudely interrupted you for an actual conversion.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.840]   Or just to talk about a product.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.000]   So like I said, we've seen the iPhone,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.720]   but we don't really know what's in it.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.760]   So we know we've heard the rumors before.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.680]   But first off, it's got a front-facing camera.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.800]   OK, let's talk about the front-facing camera.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.040]   We all know that because of, by the way, Joshua,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.480]   kudos to you for not giving that clown $5,000.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.680]   Well, I mean, hey, we're not choir boys.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.000]   We were very tempted.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.400]   I mean, we talked to these guys.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.920]   We thought about buying that phone.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.440]   We definitely had conversation.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.520]   And why did you not?
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.040]   By the time-- well, they were liars.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.960]   They were obviously pretty bad liars.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.360]   And by the time we got to any point where we were even
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.080]   considering it, it was out of our reach.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.240]   It was-- we didn't know if they were telling the truth about it
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.600]   at all.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.840]   I mean, by the time we got to that point where maybe we would
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.480]   buy it, maybe we wouldn't, it was like--
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.360]   it just seemed like it maybe was a fake.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.840]   These guys didn't have it.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.520]   So you didn't go to the AOL lawyers,
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.880]   and they said, no, no, whatever you did.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.280]   No, we did.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:36.800]   We did.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.600]   We had a conversation with them in the midst of all this.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.800]   And they said you'd be crazy to buy it.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.240]   Do they say you'd be at risk of criminal prosecution?
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.720]   I mean, almost verbatim said you would be insane to pay money
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.080]   that phone.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.520]   And this was after we had already had huge debates.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:55.880]   Because we had--
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.880]   You took a picture of it, though, right?
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.920]   We had some pictures that we were given.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.160]   And we didn't know if they were real.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.480]   When we posted this picture--
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.600]   You didn't take them.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.480]   They gave you pictures.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:04.920]   No, no, no.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.400]   We didn't take them.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.440]   We never saw it in person.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.840]   We never met these guys in person.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.120]   But when we published this, part of the reason we published
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.440]   them was we said, we don't know what this thing is.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.120]   It could be fake.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.120]   It could be a knockoff.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.560]   It could be anything.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.960]   It didn't seem--
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.080]   we were kind of like, you know what?
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.320]   It's probably a knockoff.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.800]   And when I woke up the next morning, people were saying, hey,
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.480]   this is a knockoff.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.720]   I thought, well, that makes sense.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.280]   It wasn't a--
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:26.880]   Is there pressure--
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.840]   how much pressure is there on you as a gadget blog to publish?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.560]   What do you mean to--
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.480]   Well, if there's pictures, even if you think, well, these
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.640]   might be not--
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.720]   we don't know what the provenances of these.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.320]   Is there nevertheless pretty strong incentive
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.560]   to publish anyway?
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.680]   Well, with whatever disclaimers you decide to put on there.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.680]   If you want to--
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.480]   the thing about it is credibility, right?
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.680]   You can't keep publishing that Photoshop or fake
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.240]   and have people come back to you and say, well, I expect--
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.320]   it has to be some shred of possibility.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.000]   That's a very good point.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.600]   And when we look at those pictures,
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.160]   we have the whole team will go over them with a fine tooth
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.240]   comb saying, what is going on here?
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.560]   Is this a Photoshop?
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.240]   Are there any artifacts?
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240]   So we really look into it.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.760]   We try not to publish garbage.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.080]   I mean, the goal is I don't want to waste people's time
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.480]   and get people thinking and worried and excited about something
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.840]   that's just a fake.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.960]   You want to-- if it's real, you want to be first.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.960]   You want to have it.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.080]   But you also--
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.680]   now, this is true because there are blogs and no names--
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.040]   I'll say no names-- where a lot of rumors get published.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.640]   And after a while, there's rumor fatigue
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.200]   where you start to say, I can't believe anything these guys say.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.600]   Because half the time, it doesn't happen.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.120]   Right.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.280]   And that's the danger.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.680]   You really don't want to be--
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.480]   you also-- I mean, for us, the idea is news, right?
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.680]   We want this news to be useful to people.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.120]   So I don't want to become a site where
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.400]   you can't count on news where you're just getting rumors.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.720]   We certainly have published stuff that didn't turn out
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.200]   to be real.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.120]   But it's always after--
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.760]   we don't do it.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.000]   If we just get a tip, somebody says, hey,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.760]   I have some information, we don't just go straight to publish.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.840]   We have to follow up on it.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.080]   We have a process for that.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.360]   In fact, the unofficial Apple web blog
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.200]   may have been bit by this picture because now they published it
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:14.560]   at first.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.920]   I think they-- go ahead.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.680]   Yeah, I actually spoke to them about--
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.720]   I mean, we've been getting the same picture sent to us all day.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.640]   You all get the same stuff, don't you?
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.000]   Yeah, and it's fit.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.720]   You can clearly-- there's trouble with the render.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.440]   It does not look like what the actual phone looks like.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.600]   If you look at the side of it there, the back,
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.760]   if it doesn't look right.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:39.640]   No, in fact, it's not square.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.960]   It's actually not square.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.680]   It's also an incredibly boring advertisement.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.520]   Yeah, the Apple app--
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.280]   they're never going to do that.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.280]   They're already used faster.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.320]   They can't use colors in the background.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.720]   These loopy things.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.320]   But Apple would never do that.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.280]   That doesn't look like Apple.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.600]   It's not the right typeface.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.560]   You have to use myriad--
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.080]   Well, it's--
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.560]   It's the--
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.080]   --rominion.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.280]   --bold or something.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.800]   And it just-- they're not doing it in colors, either.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.080]   They're not going to do it in colors.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.480]   If they were going to do it in colors,
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.120]   we probably would have seen-- because we've seen white
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.400]   and we've seen black leaks from Vietnam and from China.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.920]   So I think if we were going to--
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.800]   if there were going to be colors,
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.720]   we would have gotten something by now.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.160]   But maybe not.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.000]   But I don't think.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.880]   I think it's happening.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.320]   So let's-- so I'm sorry.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.480]   I got a little bit on the side track,
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.280]   because I just wanted to thank you, Joshua, for not falling
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.800]   into this.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.160]   I don't want to be like--
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.040]   I appreciate that.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.160]   But we were very tempted.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.800]   I don't necessarily know if--
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.920]   I think there are things that happened with the phone.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   Had we gotten the phone--
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.880]   I mean, it's possible.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.760]   Had the guy said we're down the street, come meet us.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.520]   When you say-- you're saying guy or guys?
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.000]   I mean, people who--
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.680]   Was it two?
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.400]   Was it more than one guy?
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.720]   We spoke to-- I mean--
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.600]   Have you been subpoenaed on this?
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.160]   No, no.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.720]   It's hard to say.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.960]   Honestly, it's hard to say.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:03.720]   When we had these conversations, it was not clear to be honest
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.880]   who had the phone.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.360]   That's one of the reasons we decided to not go.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.560]   And that's one of the reasons we decided
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.400]   to publish the photos.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.640]   Our thought was we don't know what's going on.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.400]   We don't know if these guys are being straight with us.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.480]   It was hinky from the start.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.560]   And we thought the easiest way to deal with this
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.200]   is just forget.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.480]   Just put this picture up.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.000]   And if it's real, we'll find out.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.120]   And if it's fake, people will say that thing is fake.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.800]   But yeah, what I wanted to say was,
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.040]   I think there are things that happen in this story that
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.600]   were I can't fault Giz for doing.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.360]   They went for it.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.640]   And if you're going to pay for a scoop, this is huge.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.080]   Somebody says, I have the new iPhone.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.600]   It's a scoop.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.040]   It's a huge scoop.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.840]   And if you get it and you do a hands-on of it,
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.800]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.960]   I'm sure that they didn't think this thing was stolen,
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.520]   which is I think how Apple considers it.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:54.880]   Right?
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.600]   Pretty clear after the de-conference
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.440]   that Steve feels like it was stolen.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.080]   I think if somebody had said we stole this phone,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.240]   I don't think Giz would have bought it.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.600]   But I think there are things that they could have done
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.400]   differently after getting that hands-on up,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.920]   that I might have done differently.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.520]   But this scoop-- and we were very torn.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.640]   We were very torn about this.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.440]   I appreciate your candor because you could have said,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.360]   yeah, we never would have done that.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.440]   Those guys--
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.640]   So I appreciate your candor, Josh.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.800]   I mean, it was just the thing is,
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.640]   it's just when you're presented with something that's so alien.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.080]   This is a completely alien thing to us.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.120]   We don't normally get people coming to us saying,
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.760]   will you pay us for this scoop and this level of scoop,
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.080]   this magnitude?
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.120]   So we were very torn.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.240]   And I think that a lot of people would be torn.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.080]   Now, I have to say, policy will not be--
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.160]   we're not unclear on it at all.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.920]   The policy is we're not even going to think about it.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.040]   Nothing is worth.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.920]   Nothing is worth the hell that he is.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   I'm sure he's going through it.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.840]   Yeah, poor Jason Chen is just dying at this point.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.160]   Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.680]   It's really pretty crazy.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.840]   So you haven't been contacted by police about this?
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.040]   Oh, I mean, they confiscated my computer.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   No.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.440]   No.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   No.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.400]   Yeah, you missed that one.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:00.760]   No.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.520]   I got a scoop for you.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.320]   I haven't been contacted yet.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.440]   But you never know.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.280]   I mean, our name is certainly there.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.560]   You know, Jobs said it.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.400]   So--
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.200]   When I heard about Jason, then Ray and his house
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.280]   take his computers, I was really scared.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:16.760]   Horrible.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.440]   I mean, I thought if they could do this to him,
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.440]   they could do it to me.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.680]   You know, I think there's a real issue.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.360]   I think the way they went about that was--
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   Well, you're all three journalists
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.960]   who are protected by shield laws.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.000]   Did it feel to you like maybe the violation of shield
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.840]   laws was going on?
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.800]   Julio, did you-- did this strike you
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.920]   as a little bit of a bad precedent?
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.760]   The police kind of raided this guy's house,
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.120]   took all his computers.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.360]   Ignored shield laws?
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.320]   Not being a lawyer nor playing one on TV.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.600]   I'm not really sure.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:50.440]   It bothered me.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.600]   I thought, you know, there are exceptions.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   If they break the law, there's exceptions.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.800]   You know, journalists just because you're
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.920]   journalists isn't protected against prosecution.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.560]   But there are reasons for the shield laws.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.960]   And I just hate the idea that--
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.680]   I mean, look, it's at worst a stolen phone.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.160]   They took everything.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.000]   They took his business cards.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.720]   They raided his house.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.120]   And it seems to me that's overreaction.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.920]   Mark, do you think?
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.440]   You also have to be careful to not specifically place
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.000]   the blame on Apple there.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.320]   Because as far as we know, this is Apple saying,
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.240]   going to a task force that--
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.080]   We don't know that.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.960]   They admit that they called the cops.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.240]   Right.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.800]   They called this--
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.240]   React.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.320]   --tasks for called React.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.800]   And they said some of our private corporate property
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   has been stolen.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.920]   And this is all the information we have.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.320]   We don't know if they said, now go kick down some doors
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.000]   and take his business cards and his iPad.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.040]   I doubt it.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.200]   I mean, I feel like people want to paint Apple.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.120]   It's not mastermind in this raid.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.400]   But that's not how it works.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.760]   I mean, in the real world, Apple doesn't call it the police
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.920]   and say, go raid this guy's house.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.760]   No, of course they.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.640]   Of course, you know, right.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.160]   They report a crime and then they
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.800]   react test to decide what to do.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.680]   I think that's the question.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.040]   The shield laws is what--
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.160]   you know, the thing is, I can't kill somebody and say,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.040]   well, I was in the middle of investigating a story
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.480]   and this guy had gotten in my way,
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.400]   so I had to take him out.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.760]   But you know, I'm protected under the shield law, right?
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.120]   I mean, you can't commit a crime--
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:20.680]   Of course not.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.840]   --and be protected by--
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.440]   I think the problem here was the way they went about me.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.800]   Do they need to break in his door?
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   Could they have come to the door and said,
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.080]   we need to talk to you about this stuff?
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.400]   Well, the shield law is to protect sources.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.080]   We don't know whether other sources are on that.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.280]   The point of the shield law is that they have to--
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.200]   that this can be circumscribed, this search,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.760]   to protect other sources.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.560]   I'm not saying you're protecting Jason Chen,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.560]   but you're protecting sources.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.240]   And they took everything, Willie Nilly,
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.760]   and gave nobody an opportunity to say, OK,
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.200]   you could take this, but not this.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.960]   So it concerned me.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.000]   I mean, this is old news.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.720]   I guess we could drop it.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.760]   But I--
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.040]   when this whole thing was going down,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.600]   I think every journalist sort of paused and asked
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.920]   themselves, how would this have played out?
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.960]   How would you turn this?
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.240]   Our news organization.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.280]   And I can see the conversations with Tom
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.160]   planning our editor, our attorney.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.400]   And I know-- I'm certain--
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.640]   I haven't discussed this with him,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.920]   but I'm certain that they would have said,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.400]   stay the frack away from that thing.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.120]   Don't go anywhere near that.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.160]   And I think--
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.480]   --as a result-- again, not a lawyer here,
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.960]   but I think Gizmo does a really shaky, flimsy ground
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.600]   in every way conceivable.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.880]   It's problematic.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.080]   I mean, it is-- obviously, that's what we were told.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.680]   And-- but--
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.840]   it's-- the question is, how far will they go against--
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.800]   how far will the police go against Gizmodo?
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.840]   I mean, who's the criminal-- if they're being looked at,
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.280]   are they the criminal here?
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.000]   I mean, is the-- are the people who sold the phone?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.560]   I mean, I've read some of those documents.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.400]   I mean, those guys don't come off looking good.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.880]   They're like hiding evidence or destroying evidence.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.080]   And I think the fear-- I'm guessing, right,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.680]   the idea that they get behind on getting Jason's computers
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.400]   was we're scared he's going to destroy evidence.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:17.880]   Right.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.800]   And we want to prevent that from happening, right?
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   So they didn't take the computers to--
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.280]   and I mean, I don't think that he would have done that.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.520]   But they didn't take the computers to look at everything
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.000]   on them.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.040]   And that's what they're saying, right?
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.120]   We're not going to look at these.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.600]   We just need to make sure-- at least I would imagine--
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.880]   we just need to make sure that still-- it's still--
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.800]   I mean, I agree with Julio.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.640]   It's shaky ground because Apple considers this thing stolen.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.080]   They reported it as stolen.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.200]   There's trade secrets that have been--
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.000]   I mean, the thing was taken apart.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.120]   It was broken while it was taken apart.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.360]   So I mean, if it's stolen property
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.680]   and there are trade secrets, not just the device itself,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.240]   but the things inside of it, it's not a good--
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.080]   It's bad all over it.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.440]   It's not a good place to be.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.440]   So however, it did give us--
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.880]   you do believe that there is the next iPhone, yes?
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.640]   So it gave us a pretty good look at what the next iPhone--
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.760]   we know front-facing camera.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.080]   Do you want a front-facing camera?
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.200]   Julio, you said you wouldn't use it.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:17.700]   OK.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.760]   I don't know if you're going to call with it.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:18.960]   OK.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.280]   My parents live in rural New Hampshire.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.000]   They just got broadband.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.400]   And I'm doing backflips for joy because my ability
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.840]   to communicate with them digitally
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   has been seriously compromised.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.680]   So our family connectivity has just taken a quantum leap.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.760]   And we're doing the whole video chat thing.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.520]   Using Skype.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.320]   Like crazy.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.800]   No, no, we're using--
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.320]   Hi chat.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   Hi chat.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:47.160]   And so at this point, I'm really looking forward
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.680]   to handing my son an iPhone--
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.880]   an iPhone--
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.280]   and having a chat with grandma.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.560]   And he's going to be all over that.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.680]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.600]   I want that front-facing camera.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   I'm going to use it like crazy.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.360]   OK.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.680]   Mark, you agree?
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.920]   I just can't think of a time when I'm out and about
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.000]   and needed on my phone.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.360]   I mean, I have it on my computer and I never use it.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.240]   I only use it to do--
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.440]   And I wonder if you'll be able to use it with anything
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.920]   but eye chat.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.360]   Is it going to be an Apple-only experience?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.880]   What is Apple going to do?
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.680]   I feel like if they don't from the start,
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.880]   they will eventually open up the front-facing camera.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   Just like they did the back-facing camera.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.160]   I think that they're going to have to--
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.480]   at some point, let people have access to it.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:28.840]   I don't know.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.400]   I think that the thing about doing an eye chat with video--
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.160]   I mean, Mark, you're saying--
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.320]   and I agree, where are you going to be
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.440]   that you need to do this thing?
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.600]   But think about the possibility of being
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.880]   able to call your wife or your brother or whatever,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.320]   when something crazy is going on.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.120]   And show them.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.680]   And show them that you're standing somewhere.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   Or talk to them while you're in Paris
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.600]   and you're on the--
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.440]   It's a typical Apple thing where there's not a strong use
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.040]   case for it.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.640]   They're kind of saying, we think you're
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.720]   going to want to do this.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.840]   And so we're going to put it in here and you will do it.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.400]   Because we put it in.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.720]   And people probably will.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.120]   I mean, you'll probably find ways to do--
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.000]   I mean, here's the thing, it's not a new feature.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.440]   People--
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.120]   No, no kids had it for ages.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.560]   I mean, we were just-- we had some people in Taipei
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.480]   at Computex.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.080]   And we have a post where they were being driven around
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.320]   by a cabbie who was talking, having a video conversation
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.480]   with somebody wild--
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.000]   Wild Drive.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.680]   Wild Drive.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.000]   There you go.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.160]   It was just like a normal thing.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.760]   And it's just-- he's talking to his wife or somebody.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   And I think it may become much more commonplace once Apple--
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.440]   this always happens.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.320]   Apple says, it's something you say, well, what do I need it for?
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.360]   And then, yeah.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.760]   Suddenly, like, I move.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.480]   You never thought you'd be editing your own movies
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.240]   if you are.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.080]   I've said that again.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   I said, nobody ever wants to edit movies.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080]   Nobody.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:46.580]   I'm standing--
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.080]   I was wrong.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:47.580]   I was wrong.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.080]   You know, I'm standing in the grocery store.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   I'm really tired of conversations with my wife.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.160]   I'm standing in the grocery store.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.680]   And I'm having her spend five minutes describing
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.280]   what it is that I need to buy for her.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.840]   I can just point the phone at it.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.640]   I'm looking forward to that.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.680]   One other hardware-- I mean, it doesn't-- it seems like--
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.560]   and this has been the case.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.680]   3GS was merely evolutionary.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.520]   This seems like the next generation
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.000]   will be merely evolutionary.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.200]   Anything revolution-- I mean, it's front-facing
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.440]   because the closest thing to revolutionary.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.920]   I think this would be a big change.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   Really?
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.240]   I mean, it could be a higher resolution screen.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   We were hearing double resolution.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   It could be a higher resolution.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   It could be a higher resolution.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   Really?
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.240]   It could be a 4 processor.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.920]   That's the processor in the iPad, which really
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.600]   is a snappy little devil.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.520]   And imagine it with more RAM, which supposedly this is going
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   to have.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   So it'll have double the RAM of the iPad.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.360]   It's going to have a higher resolution screen.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.760]   Almost the resolution of the iPad, from what I understand.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.760]   Really?
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.760]   Wow.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.400]   People are saying-- or no, yeah, people are saying 960 by--
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   what's the number?
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   800?
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.640]   It's double.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.040]   It's double the current--
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   720, probably.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   960.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   480.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   480-- no, I'm confused.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   It's--
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.680]   No, the 480 is 960.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.920]   It's 320 by 480, so it's 960 by 480.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.920]   By 480.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   640.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   640.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.920]   960 by 640.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.400]   My math is awful, apparently.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.400]   But that's amazing.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.440]   That's quite a high resolution screen.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.600]   Yeah, so it'll double.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.960]   And I've heard some rumors.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.840]   It's not stuff that we published,
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.360]   but they're going to have all kinds of new ways
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.520]   to scale up apps.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.560]   And I think the thing about that--
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.760]   I mean, I think this is going to be a big change.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.600]   I think this is going to make the EVO and other phones not
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.280]   look as quite as amazing as they do today.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.040]   I think tomorrow, unfortunately--
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.280]   and I think the EVO is a great phone.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.680]   The incredible is a great phone.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.920]   There are a lot of very strong competitors
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.440]   that have bested the 3GS in terms of tech.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:42.200]   But tomorrow, they may have to go back to the drawing board,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.640]   which I think is what Apple does.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   Could I ask you a question, though?
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.840]   The one feature in Android that's killer for me
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.640]   was whenever I am in an unfamiliar place,
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.680]   I fire up the driving directions.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.920]   I've engaged it hurt anything about--
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.680]   Turn by turn.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.360]   Apple implementing turn by turn.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.600]   That would be awesome.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.880]   I mean, there's a rich marketplace for that.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.000]   They could just-- I mean, doesn't Google
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.400]   want to spread its turn by turn navigation everywhere it can?
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.440]   It seemed to me like they would say, hey, can we tap into this?
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.440]   It's already there.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.760]   It's using your maps.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.560]   Steve, at the De-conference, Steve said,
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.640]   we don't mind using Google stuff on our phone, right?
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.640]   Yeah, and I don't think they do.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.400]   Google does some stuff really, really well.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.440]   Why not?
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.360]   He's painting Google as non-competitors,
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.600]   where another quote from that was,
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.480]   they decided to come in and compete with us.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.800]   We didn't compete with them.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.200]   We didn't go after their search.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.320]   I went after our phone.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.800]   I think it was the last WWDC that I was at last year.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.080]   They had said turn by turn directions
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.240]   would be coming from Google.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:42.720]   OK.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.480]   We never saw it.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.440]   I think that may have more to do with a business move
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.480]   in that they make the most money from TomTom Apps
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.880]   and the $90--
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.520]   Like a ton of money from $90 apps.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.200]   That's $30 bucks in their pocket.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.360]   And there's some of those top grossing apps.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.320]   They may argue.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.960]   They may also argue because, in fact, it may not happen
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.280]   but because when they talked about multitasking,
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.080]   they talked about turn by turn.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.480]   They said, what do you really need to for?
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.560]   Well, turn by turn directions.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.200]   That's something you need to keep running,
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.840]   even if you're doing other things.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.480]   But I think Apple would say, well, we're giving you a choice.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.520]   You can get TomTom.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.040]   You can get Telenav.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.600]   You can get all these different services
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.640]   instead of just being locked into one thing.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.200]   Now, to be honest with you, I see the value in that.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.880]   I love Google's navigation, but it has taken me
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.760]   some crazy roots before.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.320]   I question whether or not it's the best navigation
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.720]   I could possibly.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.840]   Not just Google, everybody.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.720]   You said, Julio, brought you through downtown San Francisco.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.400]   I knew you.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.120]   Yeah, the Google navigation, I just kind of went blind
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.720]   and trusted it to get me to the cottage.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   But I've had that happen.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.720]   And I've had that happen.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.720]   I've had that happen on every GPS I've ever used.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.960]   Sometimes you just get crappy direction.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.240]   Like, what were you thinking?
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.040]   It's a computer.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:55.480]   That's why.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.640]   And it kept contradicting itself.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.640]   First, I said, go here.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.440]   And then five minutes later, I said, go in the other direction.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.360]   I missed a can.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.320]   John Gruber has a nice post from April about this higher
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.520]   res screen.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.200]   According to his calculations, it's 162 pixels an inch.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.400]   That's a higher resolution than a Mac display.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:17.240]   That's an incredible resolution.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.160]   And Gruber has some secret sources.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.320]   I mean, he gets some money.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:22.880]   He gets some good stuff.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.720]   He never wants it a while.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.080]   He nails something.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.040]   So he may be right on.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.080]   I've heard the resolution is really high.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.640]   I haven't heard a number, but from very reliable sources,
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.720]   I've heard that it's really high.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.120]   And this number makes sense to me.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.040]   LCD screen, though.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.240]   Not on AMOLED, right?
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.520]   I don't think they'll go to AMOLED.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.040]   I think that they recognize the biggest problem with AMOLED,
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:45.640]   which is--
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.000]   Daylight.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.480]   Can't see it in the daytime.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.520]   Daylight's best.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.960]   It's really, really problematic.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.520]   I mean, I love the Nexus 1.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.000]   But every time I have to try to make a call during the day
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.400]   outside, it's like--
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.200]   It's hard to use.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:57.680]   Just guessing.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.920]   Just guessing what I'm--
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.240]   Well, the iPad has that problem, too.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.320]   Although I imagine they'll use these IPS displays,
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.560]   I would think, in a high-res iPhone.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.720]   Yeah, it's likely.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.240]   I think they have a technology they like,
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.800]   and they're going to keep using.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   They're definitely going to have to opt the battery life here,
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:12.960]   though.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.080]   You're talking about a lot of new stuff going on, right?
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.360]   You've got this front-facing camera.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.160]   You've got a higher resolution display.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.600]   Five megapixel camera, I think, is the rumor for the one
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.440]   on the back, and then faster processor, more RAM.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.040]   So my guess is they're going to do something pretty--
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.600]   I mean, the battery's pretty big in this thing
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.400]   from what we've seen in the Giz tear down.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.440]   I'm going to correct myself.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.240]   The existing iPhone is 162 pixels per inch.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.120]   A 960 by 48 display at 3.5 inches
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.920]   would be 330 pixels per inch.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.880]   Is that impossible?
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.640]   That's laser printing.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.840]   That's a laser printer.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.240]   It's going to be great for reading.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.360]   Maps will look good.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:56.880]   That's right.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.040]   Reading will be good if you've got the right fonts.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.360]   Well, you think they're probably going
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.680]   to put iBooks onto the iPhone.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.280]   Yeah, they said they were doing that with OS4.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.480]   Oh, that's right.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:06.840]   That's right.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.440]   They announced it.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.920]   So that'll happen.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.720]   It'll be great.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.640]   I'm sure they'll tout it.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.720]   They'll say, look how clean the text looks on this.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.320]   All right, I've got a conspiracy theory.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.000]   I want to run by you guys so that you can mock me, laugh at me,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.120]   and make fun of me.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.280]   And I know you're going to do that.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.920]   But I really think there's going to be a really important one
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.720]   more thing tomorrow.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.640]   And I'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.320]   But before I do that, I do want to mention
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.520]   my friends at Carbonite.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.640]   We'll take a little break here.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.920]   Mark Millian is with us from the LA Times,
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.920]   from the Pioneer Press, Julio Hoejdez of Zapata,
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.720]   and from Engadget, the Editor-in-Chief of Engadget.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.640]   Joshua Tapalski, we're glad to have all three of you on.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.440]   Carbonite, I've mentioned before.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.520]   Many times, I hope you know about Carbonite.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.440]   Carbonite is the leader in online backup for PCs or Mac.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.360]   And one of the things I like about Carbonite
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.880]   is it's automatic.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.200]   If you have to remember to backup, let's face it.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.120]   If I have to remember to backup, it ain't going to happen.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.360]   Carbonite does it for you automatically.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.760]   In fact, if you go right now to Carbonite.com
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.040]   and use the offer code TWIT, you could try this
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.720]   without even a credit card for 30--
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.160]   I'm sorry, 15 days, which will give you enough time
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.240]   to really get a sense of how this works.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.600]   As soon as you install the software,
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.120]   it starts backing up using your high speed internet
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.200]   connection right to the cloud, to the Carbonite servers.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.080]   You can use AES-256-bit encryption if you want.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   Passwords yours.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.040]   You don't have to tell anybody, so it's very private.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.680]   It backs up all your personal files, financial records,
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.760]   photos, music.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.520]   So they're safe and sound.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.440]   You can tell it what folders to backup.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.600]   I think on the free trial, you can't back up video,
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.000]   because that's so big, but everything,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.200]   but the video on the free trial.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.400]   And then when you buy, you can back up everything.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.640]   Unlimited backup from your internal hard drive
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.280]   for less than $5 a month.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.080]   But to me, it's not the price is secondary.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:51.680]   It's affordable.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.560]   Yes, it's a great deal.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.400]   You don't have to pay more when you upload more.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.360]   But the real deal is how easy it is to use,
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.680]   how well-written the software is.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.960]   It never slows your computer down.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.400]   It knows what you're doing.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.760]   It doesn't use your internet access
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.320]   until you're not using it.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.640]   So it stays out of the way, but it just happens.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.560]   So you are backed up.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.240]   And you can access those files from any computer
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.720]   you can get online with, including your iPhone.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.760]   There's great iPhone software.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   I mentioned this before.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.480]   I mentioned it one more time.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.320]   My daughter's going to college in the fall,
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.080]   and I am putting Carbonite on her laptop,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.000]   because I'll tell you what, you know that laptop might get
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.880]   stolen, the hard drive might die.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.080]   More likely than all of that, she might just accidentally erase
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.920]   the paper that's due tomorrow.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.560]   And when I get that call, dad, what do I do?
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.920]   The paper, I erased it.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.000]   I can say, good news.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.960]   I got Carbonite on there.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.200]   You just go and get it.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.880]   Carbonite.com.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.960]   It's backup done right.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.200]   You gotta back it up to get it back with Carbonite.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.880]   So big announcement from AT&T last week.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.160]   Actually, a couple of announcements.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.960]   First from AT&T, they said, we're going to double,
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.000]   effectively, our early termination fees on our phones.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.440]   To what is it?
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.640]   375 on smartphones.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.600]   Then, late last week, they say, oh, and by the way,
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.720]   you know, that unlimited pricing plan for data
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.520]   that you're getting the iPad, the 30 bucks for all you can eat,
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:05.800]   that's gone.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.200]   Starting, and here's an interesting date, June 7th.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.960]   They say you can order an iPad between now and June 7th,
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.360]   and even if you don't get it by June 7th,
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.520]   we'll guarantee that $30 unlimited.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:21.520]   But from now on, $15, 200 megabytes, $25, 2 gigabytes,
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.640]   $10 a gigabyte in advance after that, tiered pricing.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.200]   So do you think it's interesting?
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   I put this to you, that AT&T announces all of this
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.240]   on June 7th.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.080]   What is happening?
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.280]   What is happening on June 7th?
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.240]   What could be going on?
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.120]   What could be, oh, wait a minute.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.800]   Maybe that one more, this is my thought.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.240]   Now, I know you guys are going to think I'm nuts.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.440]   One more thing, oh, and the iPad and iPhone on Verizon.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.360]   - I got a better one.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.880]   - Okay.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.560]   - How about on Verizon and Sprint?
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.800]   - And Sprint, Antimo.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.920]   - Antimo, every network in America.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.320]   - Yes, tell me you didn't, you just get chills.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.160]   - I did.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.000]   - I said that.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.840]   - I got chills.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:05.640]   - Yeah, I do, right?
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.680]   If it happens, that would be it.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.800]   - It's over, it's all over.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.720]   We're gonna switch this end.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.840]   - It's all over for AT&T.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.840]   - I just shot down the site
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.360]   'cause there won't be any more gadgets to report on.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.520]   - Isn't that, you know what, that's brilliant, Joshua.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.360]   Why not?
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.760]   Why stop at Verizon?
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.040]   - I mean, T-Mobile's a very short step.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.360]   All you have to do is change the bands.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.200]   - Same radio.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.840]   - If you're building CDMA and you've got GSM,
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.880]   go all the way.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:29.640]   - So if you do CDMA, you're gonna lose data
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.040]   and voice at the same time.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.880]   And I think that if they do it,
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.760]   which would be the smartest thing that they've ever done.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.680]   And, you know, Steve Jobs is not a dummy.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.800]   If they were to do it, they would say,
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.880]   you lose data and voice at the same time.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.760]   That's how the CDMA networks work.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.560]   But we think the Pro's outweigh the cons there.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.360]   And it's a great experience regardless.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.320]   - And we believe in choice.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.160]   - Right.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.480]   - We're the open solution.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.120]   (laughing)
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.480]   - Just imagine a world where everybody who's on Verizon,
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.600]   everybody who's on Sprint and everybody who's on T-Mobile
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.240]   can also buy the iPhone in America.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.960]   - So you don't think I'm crazy?
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.160]   - I mean, you're crazy.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.520]   And it's probably not gonna happen.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.760]   But I think the timing is really unusual.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.800]   That the seventh, making these changes on the seventh,
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.400]   the termination fee thing.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.200]   - Is a little unusual.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.200]   And I think that it could very well happen.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.240]   - I think that the termination fee
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.840]   is only following suit with Verizon.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.880]   Verizon's already doing that.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.720]   Let's face that.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.360]   - I think they're just trying to stay in line there.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.120]   And the data, I think their AT&T is saying,
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   "Holy crap, everybody's gonna do video conferencing."
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.520]   We better put some limits on this
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.000]   or our tower's gonna get hands on.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.160]   - Oh, so you think it's in response
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.480]   to the front-facing camera?
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.680]   - I think it's in response to the front-facing camera,
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.440]   them opening up VoIP on the app store.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.600]   I think they're just getting ready for a flood
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.680]   of people going to data rather than voice-
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.640]   - Will there be tethering, finally?
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.760]   - Yeah, I believe, well, look, AT&T said-
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.840]   - The 3GS can do tethering.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:57.680]   - But AT&T has to be-
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.280]   - The AT&T said last year we'll have it by the fall.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.120]   - Not here.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.040]   - Yeah, they could do it in Canada.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.880]   They could do it in Europe.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.800]   They just can't do it on AT&T.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.680]   - I heard rumors that it's gonna be
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.120]   an extra $20 per month.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.160]   - That would be a good deal.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.720]   - I can tether right now on my Froyo 2.2 Nexus One for free
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.400]   'cause Timo hasn't figured that out yet.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.240]   I can tether-
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.640]   - Froyo. - Froyo.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.720]   - Froyo.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.720]   - Yeah, it's frozen yogurt.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.960]   - Froyo, did I say Froyo?
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   - I think I'll say Froyo.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.800]   - Froyo.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.640]   (laughs)
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.880]   It's like a made-up word.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.720]   - I'm not the Froyo.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.600]   - But I mean, look, I agree, I agree with Mark.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.360]   You know, it is in line with a lot of other stuff.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.040]   I don't think that your conspiracy theory is crazy,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.000]   but I kind of love a good conspiracy theory.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.920]   - Let's make it really good.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.640]   Let's juice it up is what you're saying.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.400]   - Yeah, I mean, why not?
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   - I like the option-
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.240]   - Pre-authorized it.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.960]   - In theory, but this rumor's been going off for two years.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.960]   - It has, but we got NASA evidence.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.640]   We got some, but you gave me an alternate excuse
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.200]   that really is pretty logical.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.040]   - Damn you.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:54.880]   - I saw what Mark said was really-
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.600]   - Damn your eyes, Mark Millian.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.680]   - It does ruin the fun of that.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.840]   - You ruined the fun.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.920]   I like Joshua, I like your idea.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.040]   - I know, all four, right?
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.680]   - Isn't it in Apple's interest though?
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.720]   I mean, why?
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.560]   - I mean-
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.400]   - Yes, it is.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.280]   - I'm not so sure about that.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.120]   - Why not?
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.040]   - AT&T is giving them a ton of money per new subscriber.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.040]   - Of course they are.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.960]   - Do you don't think the other carriers would do that?
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.800]   - I don't think so.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.080]   Once you open it up to everybody,
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.320]   what is the incentive?
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.760]   There's no exclusivity there.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.560]   Why is Verizon gonna say we'll give you four?
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.160]   - Well, if you're Verizon, if you're Verizon,
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.240]   you say I've got the best 3G network
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   and it's more reliable and blah, blah, blah, whatever they say.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.000]   And you know that there are people, lots of people
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.400]   who have Verizon or want to get Verizon
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.280]   because they know it's so reliable.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.720]   There's a huge incentive to give them this phone,
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.160]   to say you don't have to go,
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.360]   if you want the iPhone, we have it, you can get it.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.520]   It's happening on Verizon.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.800]   I mean, to me, the incentives are just, they pile up.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.240]   Same for all of these carriers.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.880]   I mean, I think it's, if you stand behind your product
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.240]   as it is, it could only get better with having the iPhone,
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.080]   right?
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.120]   That would be their stance, I would imagine.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.680]   - My suspicion is that AT&T is just offering Apple
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.200]   an insane amount of money for these subscribers.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.560]   They've got to be, but don't you think Apple's
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.280]   a little mad if AT&T says, oh, that $30 thing
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.560]   that you announced in January is now not,
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.400]   don't you think that would, that pissed me off?
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.360]   - That is a weird, it's a weird change for the iPad
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.440]   since nothing is changing about the iPad.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.800]   I mean, the iPad is still gonna be the iPad tomorrow, right?
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.200]   - Yeah, there's no more additional capabilities.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.120]   - Unless there's a front facing iPad camera?
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.520]   - They throw a conspiracy theory out.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.080]   They announce a new iPad that's joining its brother,
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.080]   the new iPhone and it's got a front facing camera.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.160]   - I don't see that.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.840]   As you're an iPad owner, you can join in on calls
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.680]   with your iPhone.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.520]   - You disagree Mark?
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.600]   Yeah, I don't see that either.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   Not so soon.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.160]   - It's conspiracy, I just do it.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.000]   (laughing)
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.760]   - Two months after the iPad comes down.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.600]   - Yeah, no, that's too soon.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.680]   - Yeah, 'cause Apple would never suddenly release
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.560]   a new product just after they released.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.480]   - Two months, I don't think that's ever happened.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.400]   - That's too soon.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   - That's pretty soon.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.480]   - Yeah.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.320]   - Damn it.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.160]   - Damn it.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.880]   - But they could, well, okay, conspiracy theory number two,
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.240]   maybe they don't do AI phone on these other carriers,
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.800]   maybe they do a Verizon iPad.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.640]   Maybe.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.460]   - Oh, I would.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.300]   - Which genius seems to think so.
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.320]   - Boy genius thinks that's what's coming?
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   - Yeah, they say that Verizon is testing a 3G iPad.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.280]   - Yeah, and we've heard rumors of CDMA iPad,
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.280]   but and then there you don't have the problem with calls
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.480]   because you're not making calls.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.320]   You don't.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.320]   - It makes huge sense actually.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.160]   - Yeah.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.560]   And so maybe that's what we're gonna hear.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.760]   Maybe maybe I'm half right.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.240]   - But I think if they do the iPad on Verizon,
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.800]   don't you think people will say why not the phone too?
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.760]   - They didn't get away with that.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.120]   - I think I would say that I still,
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.000]   but I've been saying why not the phone for three years?
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.160]   Why AT&T?
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.120]   Every, eight, you know, I have to say one thing.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.640]   Yeah, maybe AT&T is glad they have an exclusive.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.080]   It's costing a lot of money.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.460]   And it's generating huge amounts of hate.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.720]   AT&T, according to PC Magazine,
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.320]   which just did testing all over the country,
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.920]   still has the fastest network,
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.040]   but ask any iPhone or iPad user,
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.680]   they're gonna laugh at you if you assert that.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.440]   I mean, it might be technically true,
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   but people don't feel like it's true.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.520]   AT&T's got some bad rep from the iPhone and iPad.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.080]   Maybe AT&T's gonna say get out of here in good riddance.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.640]   - No, it's a good problem to have for AT&T, don't you think?
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.480]   - Yeah.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.760]   - They say we've got so many users.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.080]   - But maybe they're not making a lot of money.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.600]   Maybe they're giving so much money to Apple
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.000]   that it's not making the money on these new users.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Do you ever think of that?
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.840]   - What about that?
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:29.680]   - Ooh.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.240]   - I love these conspiracies.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.360]   But the eternal question, which maybe in gadget
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.440]   has an educated answer for,
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.280]   is are the AT&T problems a result of AT&T
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.480]   or a result of the iPhone's popularity?
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.360]   Well, the same thing happened to Verizon
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.200]   once they get out of it.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.280]   - Well, if you spread it around,
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.680]   many carriers is gonna be better
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.280]   than if it's just all an AT&T, right?
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.100]   - Let me ask you a question.
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:55.320]   Do you know people who have like a bold 9,700 on AT&T?
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.440]   Do you know anybody with a blackberry
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.280]   or any other phone on AT&T?
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.200]   - Yeah, lots of people.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.120]   They don't hate it.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.040]   - They have the same problem?
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:01.960]   - No.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.880]   - Do you ever think that maybe it's not AT&T?
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:04.840]   - It's the iPhone, man.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.440]   That's what some people assert.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.040]   - Do you ever think those notches on the new iPhone
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.720]   might be, you know, antennas?
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   - To help call dropping issues?
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.200]   - I'm thinking maybe it's not just AT&T
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.160]   and I'm not trying to defend them.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.280]   But I have gotten the impression
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.760]   that it's possible that there's a kind of a combination
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.240]   happening here, that the phone may not be so great
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.000]   when it comes to antennas.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.120]   And we know they've struggled with the antenna issue, right?
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.040]   The original iPhone had this plastic piece
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.240]   on its aluminum back then they canned aluminum
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.960]   'cause obviously they were having trouble.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.120]   I mean, I'm guessing, I don't know why
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.480]   they would want to go away from it.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:43.000]   And now the new one has an aluminum rim around it
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.120]   but the back is some kind of tempered glass or plastic.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.600]   So, I mean, I think that it,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.840]   I think that it, the question should be raised.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:57.480]   Is it AT&T's network or is it the iPhone itself
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.760]   or is it just a combination of the two?
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.720]   I think it's a combination.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.120]   I think that if you ask the BlackBerry user,
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.240]   they don't have the same problems.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.800]   - Somebody in the chat room pointed out
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   that somebody called BeatTV, B-E-E-T.TV
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.760]   and never, I don't know who they are,
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:15.760]   had a video interview with a Verizon spokesperson at D.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.560]   - John Johnson. - John Johnson, you know him?
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.400]   - John Johnson.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.240]   Now, I actually met him at D.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:26.480]   - He says, " Verizon has the C.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.080]   "There is no plan for Verizon's sport,
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.280]   "Apple mobile devices in quote, the immediate future."
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.800]   End quote, well that could be tomorrow.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.880]   Maybe, who knows what the immediate future is.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.760]   - He's pulling in jobs, he's, you know, it's like the books.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.680]   - Well, you gotta figure,
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.920]   if you're about to partner with Apple,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.480]   you're not gonna pull the mistake, who was it?
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.400]   McGraw Hill. - McGraw Hill.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.840]   - McGraw Hill. - McGraw Hill.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.680]   - You're not gonna do that.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.040]   You've learned the lesson that you don't say, yeah.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.600]   - That was great, see, I was like,
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.120]   "Oh yes, he's announcing his tablet thing tomorrow
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:56.960]   "and we'll be there."
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.160]   - I think you still can't buy McGraw Hill book something.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.920]   - No, no. - I believe the punishment
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.280]   is still on.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.600]   - I mean, you heard Steve at D, right?
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.640]   They go, when they're wrong, he doesn't take it lying down.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.920]   - Steve holds grudges.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.120]   - Yeah, he goes for the throat.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.960]   - Steve, I mean, frankly, let's face it,
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.320]   this whole adobe thing comes from way back,
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.600]   way back many years ago when adobe said,
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:23.080]   we're gonna stop making premier for McIntosh.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.400]   And Steve hit the roof and said,
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.400]   we are gonna screw adobe every which way we can.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.400]   Quick, find a video editing program,
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.680]   they bought Final Cut.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.080]   And I think it goes back to that.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.120]   Steve's still holding that grudge.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.480]   How many years ago was that?
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.680]   Don't screw with the job, myster.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.160]   - He was just waiting for the right moment, right?
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.040]   He invented the dish, best serve cold.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.160]   - Exactly.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.960]   - It's like I'm really gonna get you.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.600]   - You think you could pull premier off the Mac?
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.920]   Actually, there's a big, we should mention this,
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.840]   there's a huge security flaw in Flash.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.440]   Steve Jobs is going, yeah, what a surprise.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.080]   Zero day exploit that is in all copies of Flash
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:09.240]   pre-version 10, and adobe has no fix for it
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.480]   and probably won't have a fix for it
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.480]   for at least a couple of weeks.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.080]   So just a word of warning, if you're using Flash,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.480]   you might wanna go to the adobe labs and get version 10.1.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:21.240]   The beta, apparently it's in, now it's a release candidate seven,
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.680]   so it's fairly stable.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.400]   - I mean, all it does is allow people
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.960]   to control your computer remotely.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.920]   It's not a big deal.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.720]   - Yeah, what am I worried about it?
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.280]   I mean, zero day, schmuro day.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.880]   - It's a complete exploit of your entire system.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.840]   - A big deal?
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.160]   - By the way, everybody who's watching this live,
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.560]   I was watching on Flash, you have my deepest sympathy.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.600]   (laughs)
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.880]   No, you're safe if you're getting it
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.560]   from a reliable site like us.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.280]   It's these, you know, it's just,
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.760]   for well, a couple of ways it could be used,
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.320]   places like MySpace, where they'll,
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.280]   I don't know if they still allow this,
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.040]   but they used to allow anybody kind of anonymously to buy ads.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.720]   Those ads could have Flash embedded,
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.040]   they could have malicious Flash apps.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.440]   Or, you know, hacker.com, I'd stay away from there
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.960]   and don't watch any Flash on hacker.com.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.960]   - Well, uh-oh.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.040]   - Some of the best stuff there.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.400]   I know, there's some good stuff there.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.560]   - I'm done for.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:14.840]   - Well, I have a Mac though, so.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:15.680]   - Oh yeah, that's true.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.880]   That's another point, by the way,
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:19.760]   that it does affect Mac, Linux, and Windows.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.520]   It's the same bug in all of all Flash platforms,
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.440]   but it's, the hacker would all,
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.200]   not merely get control of your machine,
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.280]   but then after an application to take advantage of it,
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.440]   seems, in most cases, these guys would say,
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.560]   "Well, I'm just ready for Windows,
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.760]   "I'm gonna be ready for Mac for it."
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.120]   Nobody has a Mac.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.440]   - 95% of the market.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:38.280]   - Right, why should I waste time writing that?
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.160]   - Except the Mac users are all spending more money,
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.920]   so they may have more in their bank account last.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.480]   - Or credit cards there.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.440]   - By the way, it does affect Adobe Reader and Acrobat as well,
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.840]   but if you're using that, you're just a schmuck.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.200]   (laughing)
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.640]   - Who uses Reader?
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.920]   - How do you really feel?
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.760]   (laughing)
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.880]   - Now come on, who uses Reader, really?
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.040]   - I do occasionally.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.520]   - You don't use Fox Center's or Qt PDF or some other PDF thing?
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.280]   - Well, typically I use preview from--
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.440]   - Yeah, if you're got a Mac, you don't need Reader.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.080]   - If I'm in Mac OS, but Reader,
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.960]   I mean, once in a while, I bust out Reader for something,
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.880]   you know, can't select something.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.640]   - I would not bust it out anymore.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:20.920]   - I advice to you, do not bust it out.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:26.240]   - Let's see, Gizmodo was banned from WWDC.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.160]   - That's surprising.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.720]   Why is this story saying Gizmodo and not Leo Laporte too?
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.760]   I mean, if I'm gonna get banned--
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.120]   - You gotta do a post about it.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.960]   - I should say.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.040]   - I should say I was banned.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.840]   No, I don't know if I was banned, I didn't ask.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.600]   We've got plenty of people there.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.440]   - It isn't, I mean, it isn't really a shocker, is it?
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.480]   - No.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.600]   - I mean, especially with the way Jobs was talking.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.040]   - You were at the D Conference, weren't you, Joshua?
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:54.880]   - No.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.280]   - So let's get, I tell you what,
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.520]   what's gonna take a break, come back in a bit
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.920]   and get Joshua's report from D8.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.080]   We also do a lightning round,
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.160]   I'm sure there's about 800 other stories we gotta get to.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.400]   It's too much fun having you guys on,
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.680]   we're gonna get you back soon.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.960]   But right now, we're gonna take a little break,
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:14.080]   Mark Millians here, Leo Hadezapada and Joshua Tupolski,
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.480]   one of the smartest groups we've ever had here
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   since last week.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.000]   I'm good that way, I don't wanna,
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.040]   I don't wanna make any implications.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.160]   - I do wanna remind you about Audible.com,
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.480]   I'll tell you what I am loving,
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.280]   I'm listening out of the girl with a dragon tattoo,
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.000]   that Millennium Trilogy and I am just loving it.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.840]   - Simon Vance is such a good reader.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.640]   Audible is the place to go for audio books,
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.720]   it's the place, I mean, there's just no question about it.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.840]   75,000 books, mysteries, thrillers, of course,
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.520]   you know, the page turners, but also history,
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.600]   non-fiction, science fiction,
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.320]   arts and entertainment, self-development and porno,
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.400]   I mean, erotica.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.720]   It's all there.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.000]   I am loving, they have now the girl who kicked
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.200]   the hornet's nest, as well as the girl with a dragon tattoo
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.120]   and the girl who played with fire,
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.040]   the full-steed-lison trilogy is now available
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.920]   on Audible.com and I've got all three of them
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.600]   on my Android phone.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.480]   I'm loving it.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.520]   Audible.com, Dan Ariely has a new one.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.640]   I loved his first book,
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:24.160]   Predictably Irrational, and his new one
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.120]   is kind of a follow-up to that.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.040]   Oops.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:29.480]   The reason I mention all these books
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.720]   is because I've got a way for you to get two books free,
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.640]   a secret, secret way to do it.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.800]   It's called the Upside of Irrationality.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.160]   If you go to audible.com/twit2,
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.920]   you'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.560]   That's the one I have, two books a month.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.800]   That's the minimum, if you ask me.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.600]   See, here's the thing, I don't have a commute anymore,
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.200]   but I just, I love to read.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.880]   For a long time, I thought I don't have time to read.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.720]   I'm too tired when I get home.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.000]   Then I discovered audible.com and I was listening
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.920]   when I went to work.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.400]   I was listening at the gym.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.680]   So listening when I did the dishes,
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.560]   listening when I walked the dog,
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.680]   and listening when I go to bed.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.440]   And now I get a couple of hours of reading
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.520]   every single day without a commute.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.960]   That means two books a month, easy.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.280]   Think of all of the great stuff you're missing.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.400]   Dan Ariely's newest is the Upside of Irrationality,
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.960]   the unexpected benefits of defying logic at work and at home.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.640]   I loved Predictability Irrational.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.480]   Get both of those.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.040]   You could get two of those free.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:26.880]   Here's what you do.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.680]   You sign up for the Platinum account,
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.960]   audible.com/twit2.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.440]   Your first two books are free.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.440]   You can cancel it anytime.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.640]   You can keep the books forever.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.880]   I don't think you're gonna do that though,
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.280]   but if you're worried, maybe I don't know.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.280]   Are audiobooks for me?
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.480]   This is the way to find out.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.320]   Listen to a great audiobook from audible.com.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.040]   Try it free, audible.com/twit2.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.960]   - Leo, I sometimes find it amazing
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   that you recommend Audible because
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.200]   after I'm done listening to all your podcasts,
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.640]   I don't have any time.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.800]   - I know, there does seem to be a conflict of interest,
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.640]   isn't it?
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.520]   - But let me tell you my favorite Audible experience
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.760]   last summer, my wife and I moved into work.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.080]   We lived in a conno for the longest time.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.000]   We finally bought a house.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.560]   Last summer, we were doing things
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.040]   like building retaining walls and things.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:14.880]   - Oh boy.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.320]   - And I was out in the sun for hours.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.120]   - You were actually doing manual labor.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.120]   - We were doing it all ourselves.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.920]   - I'm so amazed, I'm impressed.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.240]   - And I whipped through all your podcasts
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.360]   and no time at all and had nothing to listen to.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.800]   So I listened to the road.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.360]   - Oh, isn't that a great Carmack McCarthy?
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.200]   Isn't that a great book?
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.040]   - Oh, wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.160]   - Do you have kids?
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.000]   I have a 12 year old.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.920]   - Yeah, a boy.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.760]   - Yes.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.600]   - Oh, then it's a must read.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.440]   It's about a father and son
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.600]   in a post apocalyptic world.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.840]   - Well, I read it and print before
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.960]   and it just, as a father, just kills you.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.800]   - It kills me.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.640]   - It kills me.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.000]   - But I was listening to it again
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.640]   and it was a wonderful execution of the book.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.400]   And the irony of listening to a society
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.440]   having been destroyed while I was building
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.080]   essentially a society with my bare hands.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:56.920]   - That's really cool.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:57.760]   - It was a great experience.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.680]   I just, yeah.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.720]   - They often I'll reread a book
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:02.560]   while they're listening to it
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.880]   and it really does, it's another experience I think.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.160]   And I swore when I read the road in print
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.080]   I'd never read it again.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.760]   But I'm really glad I listened to it in Audible.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.720]   - You know, it's another good book
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.320]   that I read in the paper form
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.800]   and then listened to and it came alive
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.360]   as Martin Yann's The Life of Pie.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.200]   Have you read that?
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.360]   What a great, oh, and the reading of it.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.920]   It might be one of my favorite audio books of all time.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.520]   So I mentioned that it is on Android now.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.360]   There's a beta.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.840]   You have to join the Google groups.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.360]   So go to Google Groups and search for Android Audible.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   And it's a couple of bugs I noticed, but boy,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.400]   this is better.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.680]   This beats the iPhone client
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.480]   'cause the iPhone client's just iTunes basically.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.080]   You sync them up and you can listen to them.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.160]   This has-- - How much they paying you, Leo.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.000]   How much is--
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.680]   - Well, they are an advertiser.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.880]   - That's Google paying you to say that.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.640]   - I love Google.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.400]   I am becoming a Google fan boy, I admit it.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.160]   No, this is great because they've got,
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.560]   you should look at the app,
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.160]   put it on your Evo, I've got it on my Nexus 1A, my Evo.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.800]   You've got details about the book,
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.600]   you've got chapters, you can bookmark any part of the book
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.240]   so that if there's a good moment, you could go back to it.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.120]   But it also has four square style badges.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.960]   It keeps track, it's got a visualizer,
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.440]   so it has, it keeps track of how much you can see
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.360]   all the stats of how much you've listened,
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.400]   total hours and minutes listened,
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.480]   and then there's like a ladder.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.960]   But it also, I think is really cool.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.640]   It has a four square style badges.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.840]   And then it has a sleep function, which I use a lot.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.840]   So now I can, I guess the iPhone does that, doesn't it?
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.880]   You can sleep.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.080]   So you're listening to the book and you can say,
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.880]   "Okay, I know I'm gonna falsely be after an hour,
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.920]   so make sure you turn it off after half an hour."
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.680]   - False sleep while reading?
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.080]   - Never.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:39.920]   - Or listening, I guess.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.160]   - Yes, of course I do.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.000]   Don't you?
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.640]   - I mean, I don't listen to books, I read.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.760]   - Well, but now I see maybe this is just me,
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.400]   but I find that I cannot go to sleep unless I read a book.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.240]   That's how I go to sleep.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.600]   - Well, no, that always puts me out.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.600]   - Yeah, puts you right out.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.120]   - Before I actually collapse into slumber,
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.760]   I put the book down usually.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.920]   - My wife does not.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.760]   Every night.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.580]   - I know people who like fall asleep
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.420]   with a book on their chest.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.520]   - Oh, every night my wife, she's got the glasses
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.080]   on the light on and the book.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.800]   Sometimes, I don't know how she does this.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.480]   It's kind of a magic trick.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.480]   The book is, she's still holding the book in the air
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.920]   and she's out like a light.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.600]   I don't know how she does it.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   It's a magic trick.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.440]   - Making that up.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.200]   - I know, it sounds unbelievable, but it's true.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.480]   - It's just completely unbelievable.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.160]   I think to the point that I think it may be,
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.000]   it's just a magic trick.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.640]   - Hey, horses sleep standing up.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.160]   Why can't my wife sleep reading?
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.000]   - Really?
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.400]   That is not a good road to death.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.240]   (laughing)
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.320]   - That's a great person.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.200]   - You've made the biggest mistake of your life.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.920]   - Okay, that's twice now because earlier,
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.200]   didn't I say something bad?
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.480]   Oh, forget it.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.960]   - I've been testing, I repeat it.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.880]   - Yeah, right.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.560]   What are you talking about, honey?
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.760]   No, you know what the beauty of this is?
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.640]   She does not listen to any of my podcasts.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.120]   None, zero zip.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.200]   - I think we know why.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.480]   - Yeah, 'cause I'm not a sucker.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.480]   - No, I love her.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.160]   She's wonderful, wonderful.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.960]   What did I say we were gonna talk about?
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.280]   - The job I'd D, I think.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.360]   - D, yeah, how was D?
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.200]   Was it good?
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.360]   - D was actually pretty great.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.480]   I mean, you know, you have a jobs interview,
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.480]   you never get to see jobs interview, right?
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.560]   So, I mean, really, the man doesn't give in.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.440]   - No, in fact, the last one was at D.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.160]   - And believe me, I've asked repeatedly.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.680]   - Yeah.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.480]   - So the thing about it that was great,
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.080]   Walt and Cara don't pull punches,
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:19.920]   'cause I'm sure you know.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.520]   They did a good job, I thought.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.640]   - They went in and they went in on everything you thought,
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.240]   well, they're not gonna ask about that.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.080]   - Right, right.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.320]   - And they just went for it.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.480]   They went right off the bat, right?
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.920]   Second question was about the phone.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.200]   The first question was what, Flash stuff?
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.640]   And they just got into it.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.800]   I meant this really good.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.960]   But then you had, so you had jobs,
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.880]   we could talk about that if you want,
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.560]   but then there was also Ballmer was there.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.120]   Peter Chow from HTC, James Cameron.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:44.960]   - And-- - I mean, it's kind of
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.880]   really great. - Mark, Zwetty Zuckerberg.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.160]   - Yeah, that sounded very entertaining.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.600]   - Wow. - Since you were at--
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.040]   - D, could I ask you a question?
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.880]   - Yes.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.120]   - Was Zwetty in your opinion, was Zuckerberg sweating
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.520]   because he was on the spot,
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.120]   or was he sweating because he was hot?
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:00.960]   Because of the hoodie.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.160]   - Was it hot in there?
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.240]   - It was not sweating because he was hot.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.080]   I could tell you that if you see it,
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.720]   have they released the full video of that?
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.440]   - I don't think the full video, I've seen clips.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.120]   - They have like a big space heater, right?
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.800]   Next to Zwetty. - I think he had,
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.200]   to be honest with you, I think he had
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.280]   like a panic attack.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.560]   You know, onstage, I think that he started talking
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.480]   about something that has been a real controversy.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.200]   And you know, you have these moments,
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.000]   and I've done it, I mean, everybody has--
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.240]   - They call it in performing arts,
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.640]   they call it flop sweats.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.440]   - You know, moments of panic where--
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.600]   - Yep, it's just not going well,
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.720]   and it's going worse and worse and worse.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.080]   - And it hits you, and you start to,
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.600]   for me, it's like I step outside myself for a second,
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.240]   I say, "Wait a second, this is awful.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.280]   "What am I doing, right?"
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.640]   And you kind of freak out a little bit.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.640]   - Flop sweats? - And I feel bad for me.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.240]   It was very, I mean, everybody was like,
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.080]   "What is going on?"
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.200]   - I think if you were, you know,
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.520]   I think you could almost make a case
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.320]   that he did himself more good than harm,
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.440]   because I think everybody felt, "Oh God."
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.880]   - Yeah, he seemed more human, but--
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.720]   - Humanized him.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.800]   - Julio and I were talking about this before,
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:03.440]   and it's like a 26-year-old CEO
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.640]   who's done a lot of great things and gotten lucky,
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.720]   but you're going up against veterans,
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.320]   you're going up against the hardest reporters out there.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.800]   It's a tough situation to be in.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.680]   - I'm surprised he even took them up on it, especially.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.280]   - He needed to. - He needed to.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.480]   - Yeah, but he blew it.
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.800]   I mean, the thing is, he needed to get on stage
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.360]   and make everybody feel like,
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.680]   "Hey, I know what's going on, I know what I'm doing,
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.720]   "I'm going to fix the stuff that people don't like,
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.080]   "we're going to make the stuff that people do like way better."
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.120]   And instead, it was weird.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:37.960]   It just got weird.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.600]   - He was the wrong guy to do it,
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.920]   but there's nobody else either,
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.640]   it seems like, not Elliot Shregg for sure, so.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.720]   - He never directly answered any questions.
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.560]   Not one.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.240]   - He just kind of rambled all over the place.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.160]   - What do you think's going on?
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:54.160]   Are they, is it just an inarticulateness?
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.400]   Is it that they're really trying to hide something?
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.300]   What's going on?
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.840]   Are they really evil?
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.360]   Are they the Illuminati?
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.200]   - That's major.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.280]   - Well, I've never met Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.200]   I don't know him, I probably never will,
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:14.040]   but I'm just, I'm going on my gut here.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:17.280]   The guy, just fundamentally, in my opinion,
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.280]   is not an honorable person in the sense of putting
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.560]   the customer first.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.440]   He's really thrilled with the little clubhouse
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.200]   he's built with his friends.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.560]   He's relishing the power.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.280]   He does have a vision for where the service is going,
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.240]   but, and he's pursuing that vision
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.840]   and at the expense often of the customer,
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.280]   and that bothers me,
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   and that fundamentally influences my use of his product.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.800]   - Well, as you know, I quit,
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.200]   because I just, I didn't know what was going on there.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.760]   - You're gonna go back though, right?
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.880]   - Oh yeah, I already went back.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.480]   - So, okay, so here's the thing about Zuckerberg.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.320]   - Yes.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.520]   - Don't, you know, I think the problem is that we all expect
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.600]   that because he had a really good idea with Facebook
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.720]   and he continues to have good ideas about the service.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.280]   And some are bad, obviously,
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.880]   but he knows one thing,
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.520]   you know, he did this thing and he does it.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.560]   He did it really well, obviously.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.800]   I just think that we make the assumption
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.680]   that he should also have a great mind
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.880]   for knowing how to treat users' privacy
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.120]   or knowing how to treat users.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.560]   - He's just a programmer maybe.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.560]   Maybe he's just a geeky programmer.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.200]   - Yeah, I just think that we shouldn't expect him
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.600]   to be able to have all those answers.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.560]   I mean, the problem is they need somebody who does,
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.760]   who has the answers, who can effectively say,
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.280]   "I get what is right and what's wrong for users."
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.480]   He doesn't seem to understand that aspect of the business.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.240]   And I think that it's dangerous for everybody to walk around
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.200]   and say, "Well, why doesn't he just have the answer?"
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   When, you know, there are a lot of people
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.400]   who wouldn't have the answer.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.880]   So, I mean, he may be very good at one thing,
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   but not good at another.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.920]   And I feel like he needs a committee
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.040]   and the committee needs to be really smart about this stuff.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.960]   And I'm not sure that that committee is there.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.520]   I mean, he says, you know, they have these meetings
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.160]   and they go over it and he's got some advisors.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.000]   You know, I assume he has people that are very close to him,
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.400]   but they probably also think like he does.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.880]   So, he needs somebody to step in and say,
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.200]   "Here's your vision and here's reality
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.000]   and the two have to find a way to meet
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.440]   and I'm gonna be the person to do that."
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.040]   - It's very simple.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:19.880]   Who said this?
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.560]   I can't remember who said it on one of our shows this week.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.760]   Facebook needs an o--
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   I don't know.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.880]   I mean, somebody said this.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.720]   Needs an ombudsman that represents the user,
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.640]   just like the New York Times and many,
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.380]   and I'm sure the LA Times have ombudsman
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:35.700]   that represent readers.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:39.220]   They need somebody who can clearly articulate
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:44.220]   what's going on and they need very simply to be opt-in.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:48.460]   If they're not opt-in, I don't buy it.
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:50.220]   If they don't flip the switch and say,
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:52.340]   "Everything's private until you say so,"
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:54.820]   they're breaking their commitment to users.
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.700]   And I think that they're never gonna do that
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.940]   because it's not as profitable as what they're doing.
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.780]   - Wow.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.460]   I mean, it may not be as profitable, but--
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.300]   - They have to do it.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.740]   That was the promise.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.100]   - Quick Facebook, Dave, is a failure, right?
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.500]   You know what everybody says?
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.980]   - Well, a failure 'cause only 35,000 quit
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.940]   and probably more people join in five minutes
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.420]   than quit the whole day.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:14.780]   - It has a reach critical mass.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:15.620]   I mean, will it?
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.460]   That's the question.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.300]   I don't think so.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.020]   I mean, it's like very inside baseball.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.660]   The privacy complaints in a lot of ways
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:23.100]   are very much in the tech world
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.940]   and in our space.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.580]   People really think about and talk about it.
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:29.900]   Up to the users at large,
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.740]   to the people of the high school students
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:32.820]   and the grandmas and everybody.
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:33.660]   - They don't know.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:34.500]   - They don't know.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.340]   - They're not thinking about it.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.620]   They're not worried about it either.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.460]   I mean, I think the issue is somebody's worried about it
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.180]   and somebody should be worried about it.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.900]   And Facebook doesn't need to be necessarily
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.780]   way out in front of it to the community at large.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.700]   They need to be out in front of it
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.100]   to the people who are thinking about it
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.300]   and watching them.
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:51.340]   - You know, it's possible for Facebook
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.860]   to suffer from this,
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.540]   or it would be if there were an alternative.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.300]   I think MySpace is a good example.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.900]   MySpace fell apart because there was Facebook,
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.620]   but there's nothing right now
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:02.940]   that people who quit Facebook can logically go to.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.180]   I mean, I looked at my art quit page.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.020]   It's not--
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.180]   - Isn't Facebook the culmination of Friendster and MySpace?
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.020]   And I mean, isn't it?
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.940]   All the things that those guys did wrong,
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:15.220]   they did right?
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.980]   - Yeah, but does that mean that that's the end of the line
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.060]   or is there a next one?
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.140]   I mean, there's Friendster, MySpace, Facebook.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.580]   - Is there an ex-Twitter?
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.420]   - Yeah. - Is there an ex-Twitter?
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:24.420]   - Yeah, there's an ex-Twitter, don't you think?
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.260]   - What is it?
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.260]   - I don't know.
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.620]   - Right, well, I mean, so we don't know,
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.100]   but at this point it's like, right,
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:32.460]   there's Google for Search, there's Twitter for--
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.300]   - Yeah.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:34.460]   - But I think it would be foolish,
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.180]   I mean, it would be foolish for anybody to say,
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.020]   oh, that's it, we're done.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.420]   It's like the patent inspector in 1920,
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.500]   said, well, everything's been invented,
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.340]   so we can pass the page.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.300]   - I agree, I think, what is the project called?
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.140]   - I asked for it. - I asked for it.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.820]   - I don't know if they asked for it either,
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.340]   although I noticed that they cashed my check.
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.700]   - Cool idea though.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.700]   - It's a great idea.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.820]   - They suffer from a very, very poisonous problem
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.980]   of having so much money to start,
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   and they want a product.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.860]   - They want a 10,000, they got several hundred thousand,
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:01.500]   right, now there's all of this pressure
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.500]   and everybody watching.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.700]   - It's four NYU students, you know what's gonna happen?
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.620]   I think this is actually gonna be fine,
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.620]   is that the open source community's gonna come to them,
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:09.700]   developers are gonna come to them,
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:10.740]   people are gonna say, look,
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.460]   you are now the de facto leaders of this movement,
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.260]   let us help you, let us help you.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:19.020]   - That would make sense, wouldn't it, if the whole idea?
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.500]   I agree though, it's tough when you,
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.420]   all of a sudden you say, hey,
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.940]   we're gonna build that solution to Facebook
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:27.500]   that everybody, we're gonna make everybody feel comfortable,
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.100]   we're gonna do the same kind of stuff,
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.620]   and then you've gotta build it,
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:33.060]   now you've got all this pressure, right?
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.500]   - Maybe it's not a Facebook, maybe it's something else.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:40.500]   You know, I think open granular, federated solution
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.620]   is probably a better solution than a single monolithic company,
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.380]   bits and pieces from a variety of places.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.020]   I think there are ways to solve this,
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.580]   and I feel the same way about Twitter,
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.660]   I don't think one company should be the arbiter of all of this.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.340]   - Well, Twitter should be the pipes, shouldn't it?
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:56.220]   I feel like that's the same thing,
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.420]   but Facebook, it's a platform, right?
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:59.620]   But I think it's a platform, you know,
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:01.020]   I don't use it the way most people use it,
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.740]   I don't know how you guys use it,
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.620]   but you know, the privacy stuff doesn't really,
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:07.820]   I'm not worried about it because I expect anything
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:11.300]   that I put on Facebook is gonna be sort of like public.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.620]   - You know, I'm smart enough to say,
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:14.780]   okay, I'm gonna use this as a public venue,
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:19.180]   but I just feel like by having a page on Facebook,
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.980]   I'm encouraging others to participate,
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.340]   maybe others who are not as sophisticated,
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.020]   like my family and friends, so I just,
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:25.940]   I say, I'm not gonna be there,
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:27.780]   I'm not gonna play in that space, I don't trust,
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:31.780]   you know what, fundamentally, I don't trust them, that's all?
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.300]   - Right, well, and Marcia, I mean,
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.260]   - Look at him, do we trust this guy?
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.380]   - No, look, he's probably, when he was speaking,
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.700]   it was just plotting something to do to us.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.660]   - It looks like Nathan Thurm, the Martin Shorts character,
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.700]   lawyer character on Saturday Night Live was,
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.460]   yeah, I knew that, anything.
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.500]   - Yeah, I'm not being defensive.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.340]   - I'm not being defensive.
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.340]   - Why are you being defensive?
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:52.180]   - And what's with the sweatshirt, okay?
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.380]   What's with the sweatshirt?
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.220]   - Poor kid.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.980]   - I know, I'm just piling up.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.220]   - Oh, the poor billionaire.
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.220]   - Yeah, he's got the money, he can afford it.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:00.420]   I mean, I have piling up.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.180]   - Going back to what Josh was saying before,
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:05.380]   I mean, Marc is just 26, he's inexperienced
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:08.340]   as a spokesperson and as a CEO,
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.700]   where he's being thrust into this on stage,
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.180]   he's awful on stage, if you see any of those F8 conferences,
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:15.900]   he's not the first time this has happened.
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:19.580]   - No, he's not charismatic, he's not a great on stage speaker,
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.740]   and to put him in front of Walt Mossberg
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:26.020]   and Cara Swisher is throwing meat into the shark's den.
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.740]   - Wow.
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.700]   - Do they feel like they piled on him?
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.220]   - They actually went that bad.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.740]   - They see, well, they're seasoned veterans.
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:35.940]   They're no Sarah Lacey.
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:40.260]   He was preceded on stage by Steve Ballmer and Jobs.
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:43.100]   These guys have been at it for a very long time
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.740]   and they know what to expect.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:47.380]   - Yeah, I think that I agree with Marc.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:48.900]   - We're not gonna pick on him anymore.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.860]   - No, I mean, okay, but you asked
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.140]   about the sweatshirt, the Illuminati thing.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:55.980]   - Yeah.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.900]   - It's a little weird, it's a little odd.
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.940]   - And that goes back to my point I made earlier.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:05.940]   This guy is just enamored with the little clubhouse
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.740]   that he's built.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:11.500]   I mean, he thinks more finally of that
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.740]   than of his customers.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.380]   I think that really bothers me.
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.660]   - Here's Marc.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.260]   - You know, there were real learning points
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:24.260]   and turning points along the way in terms of building things.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:30.140]   You know, it really went from this position very early on
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:32.380]   where we were just in this college dorm room
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.780]   to we moved out to California.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.540]   There was a few friends in me.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:40.100]   And you know, it just kind of had this project feel
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.260]   for a while and there was this real turning point
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:45.380]   when companies were trying to buy them.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.220]   - I've seen this before.
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:47.060]   - I've huge amount of money.
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.260]   - When you work in TV, you see this happen all the time.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.420]   Somebody comes on and you're interviewing them
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.500]   and their brain just isn't working.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.740]   They're so scared, they're so nervous
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:57.980]   that their brain's not working
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.820]   and what comes out is mincemeat.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.820]   And I've seen this before and I'm actually very sick.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.820]   He should have been drunk, he would have been much better.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.620]   - A little glass of vodka goes a long way
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.420]   before you go out.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:09.860]   - I mean, it's speaking advice.
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:10.700]   - All it is.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.380]   - So products can help people stay connected.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.420]   - Yeah, I mean, he's just pulling
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:16.980]   a cliche after cliche at his hat.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.620]   You went back to like the start up.
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:19.460]   - Oh, we were just there.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.380]   - Two kids in a dorm room and just myself in a dorm room.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.220]   - If I knew him.
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:25.420]   - He went to harp on them, how small of a company
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.460]   they actually are, you know.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.380]   And I think that he did try to sort of tell,
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.460]   paint this picture or the small company.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.980]   You know, we're just figuring stuff out.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.860]   You know, we're, but it's, you know,
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.060]   you have a lot of, how many Facebook users are there?
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.460]   400 million or something.
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.540]   - Almost half a billion now.
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:42.740]   - So that's, you know.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.740]   - There's a lot of women in the audience that wish you wouldn't.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.580]   - More people than.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:46.420]   - No.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.260]   - Here's an arrow.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.260]   - Whoa.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.420]   - Kara makes him take it off.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.260]   - All right.
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.060]   - Yeah, you sure wind that a little bit.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:52.900]   - That's okay.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.900]   - Well, you don't have to, not gonna tell you what to do.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.420]   - You explain what this instant person was doing.
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.100]   - He's kind of surprised by how much he's sweating.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.500]   - Let me rewind it if I can grasp the arrow here.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.300]   - He says, whoa, it's weird.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.620]   - I thought that was fascinating, Ian.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.060]   - Okay, you wanna take off the hoodie?
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.100]   - No, I never take off the hoodie.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:06.940]   - I know you, Joe.
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:07.780]   What's with that?
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.180]   There's a group of women in the audience
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.820]   that wish you would, and you know.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:12.820]   - Girls.
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:13.660]   - Whoa.
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:15.500]   - He's the whoa is,
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.740]   'cause he can't believe how sweaty he is.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.420]   - I mean, look how scared he gets.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.020]   I mean, it's like, I feel bad for him.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.900]   I mean, seriously having a panic attack.
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.220]   - Yeah, no, I've seen it before.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.220]   It's exactly what he's got.
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:26.580]   - I mean, you know, then maybe he shouldn't go
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.340]   and have interviews with Walt and Kara at the--
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:30.380]   - Well, he won't do it again.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.660]   - Or he might try again.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:33.380]   - Do you think there's anybody at Facebook
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.580]   and look Kara so motherly,
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:36.500]   she actually starts to help him take it off.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.620]   Do you think there's anybody at Facebook--
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.460]   - Not history.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:44.460]   - That can tell Mark Zuckerberg not to go D to D8 or D9.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:46.420]   - What are we gonna do with the mic?
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.580]   - Put it on your phone.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:48.740]   - Put it on the collar of your teeny.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:49.580]   - Yeah, I mean--
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:54.380]   - This is like two parents with a teenager
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:56.220]   helping him take off his hoodie.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.660]   I mean, there's this real weird--
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.740]   - We're not even yelling at you.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.580]   - Yeah.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.420]   - Yeah.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:01.260]   - Yeah.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.620]   - Maybe Randy should tell him this sister needs to--
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:04.620]   - Randy. - Sister Lee.
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.620]   - There you go.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:06.460]   - Yeah, I mean--
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:08.020]   - Now how do you feel today
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.620]   that's the thing I mean?
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.900]   So yeah, it's a bad experience.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.620]   This is what kind of sucks, right?
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:15.540]   Most of us have a bad conversation with somebody
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:16.900]   or we say something stupid.
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.500]   And this is kind of how I feel about the book
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.580]   and all the stuff you said.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.940]   - Wait a minute, that Illuminati thing is not in the outside,
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.580]   it's on the inside. - That's on the inside.
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.500]   - Oh, that is creepy.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.340]   Wait a minute, you can't even see it unless they take it off?
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.660]   - They recreated it on SF Weekly, have you seen that?
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:33.180]   - Yeah.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.020]   - You should look at it--
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.540]   - And it has to do with OpenSocial
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.020]   and what the OpenSocial--
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.020]   - It says 2010 in the middle,
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.300]   it's like the mission statement for 2010.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.460]   It's platform and--
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.820]   - Creepy.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.220]   - It does seem like maybe they had a designer
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:47.420]   and he was like, hey, check this out,
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.780]   it's kind of funny or it's cool.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.380]   And they were, maybe they said, oh,
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.260]   we should get it in our hoodies or something.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.260]   I don't know, like it was a very nonchalant,
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.380]   they didn't make a big deal of it.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.020]   And then all of a sudden now,
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:58.580]   it's a huge topic of discussion.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.620]   - Well, not everybody knows it's not that.
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:04.700]   - Or it is a conspiracy and they're very evil.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.740]   - And I think I read somewhere where one of the hoodies
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.220]   popped up on eBay.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.340]   - Yes, $300.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.820]   - Some have been saying they gave hoodies out
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.580]   to every employee that I didn't want to.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.940]   - I didn't realize it was on the inside though,
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.980]   I thought this is on the outside like a biker.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.980]   This is hidden.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.260]   - It does look, it does really look like a weird
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:24.140]   kind of religious symbol or, you know,
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.100]   like the eye of Horus or something.
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:28.900]   - No wonder they can't articulate their mission.
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:30.820]   That's their mission.
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:32.380]   Well, look at it.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:33.420]   - For those of you not on video,
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:36.300]   there's an SF Weekly blog post you can go looking.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.700]   - See, it's got three arrows with graph, stream,
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.700]   and platform open and connected,
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:43.500]   making the world open and connected Facebook,
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.700]   plus one, and then two arrows that don't have anything.
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:48.660]   And, oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:50.700]   - You hold a pale Facebook.
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.620]   (laughing)
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.940]   - There's something that's a joke there, I don't know.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:55.820]   - There's a joke, exactly.
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.220]   - Right, I mean, it definitely is unusual,
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.220]   say the least.
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.300]   But I am thinking about doing something
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.620]   like that for end gadget, little--
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:03.540]   - I think we all should.
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.260]   - I wanna twit to Hoodie with a secret logo inside,
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.660]   or only you can see it.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:12.900]   - A couple of quick lightning round moments.
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.140]   Mark Millian, you did a story in the blog
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.820]   about Twitter's fake BP spokesman.
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.300]   - Oh man, have you seen this?
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.140]   - Tell me about it.
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.940]   - Twitter.com/BPglobalPR.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:23.780]   It's awesome.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.500]   I caught it fairly early on and reached out to him
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.100]   and did everything I could to make contact.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.300]   He still won't tell me what his name is.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.140]   And he does--
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.020]   - He's just some guy, right?
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.140]   - Yeah, he's finally now talking to me
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.180]   like a normal person, but starting out,
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.100]   first interview I got, he did it in character
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.140]   and it was hilarious.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.740]   - 131,000 followers in just a few weeks.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.620]   - hilarious, yeah, it's still hilarious.
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:46.460]   - Yeah.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:47.300]   - It's really good.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:50.460]   - His latest tweet, "We take this situation very seriously,
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.300]   which is why tonight's oil wrestling event
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:55.140]   will be followed by a candlelight vigil."
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.220]   - Jeez, I love it.
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.660]   This is really funny.
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.340]   - Real zingers in there, unfortunately, you know,
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.900]   I mean, it sucks because they're not really--
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:05.740]   - It's real, it's real.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:06.780]   - It's real, that's true.
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.420]   Safety is our primary concern.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.020]   Well, profits, then safety.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:13.220]   Oh, no, profits, image, then safety.
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:15.100]   But still, it's right up there.
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.420]   - He sent me this sort of like manifesto
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:21.900]   where he's saying, "I'm like a dude in my underwear doing this."
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:25.060]   And sometimes it's easy just to get mad
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.060]   or keep it to yourself, but here is like a way
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:30.420]   to laugh at it instead of getting mad.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.460]   And it's reaching a lot of people.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:36.780]   - And also probably a lot of people think this is VP.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.620]   - Right.
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.260]   - There have to be people who see this and go,
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:40.420]   "This is VP."
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.900]   - And I guess Twitter says,
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.540]   "Well, they'll take it down if there's confusion,
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:45.740]   but I don't know, nobody's complaining."
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.900]   - That would be really annoying.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.020]   - I asked him to take down,
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.460]   there was a fake Leo Laporte who was saying things like,
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.700]   you know, I mean, he was saying like sexual stuff,
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.660]   like crazy stuff.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:54.500]   I asked him to take it down.
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.100]   They said, "No, it's parody."
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:56.940]   So--
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.580]   - So they left up your second account?
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.420]   - Yeah.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.140]   - Your secret account.
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.380]   - My secret account, all my sexual fake adillos.
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.220]   - Fake Leo Laporte.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.060]   - Fake.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:06.900]   - Fake.
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:07.740]   - Yeah.
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:08.580]   - That's nuts.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.380]   - You see weird, very sexy stuff.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:11.780]   - Sexy, sexy stuff.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.780]   It's a sexy guy.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.500]   - "Computex, anything big from there?
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.260]   2010, the big Taiwanese fare.
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:19.340]   I know a lot of slates."
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:22.940]   Steve Gibson counted 42 or 43 something like that.
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.740]   - Slates that are not good.
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:26.700]   - We'll never see the light of day.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.180]   - Well, they might, but they're all doing the same thing.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.500]   We've seen like bad Android.
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.100]   And then we've seen, you know,
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.420]   Ballmer talked about this at D8.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:37.060]   He talked about tablets and windows on a tablet
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.420]   and what they're gonna be like.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:39.900]   And so we saw a lot of,
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:43.740]   we saw some Windows 7 tablets and Windows,
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:46.620]   it's called like embedded compact 7,
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.300]   which is basically C87,
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.860]   which they're saying to people,
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.180]   okay, this isn't Windows.
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:56.140]   Make a different kind of skin for it.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.660]   Build your own tablet OS on top of it.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.420]   Won't be compatible with Windows 7.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.380]   But then you have Ballmer saying,
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:04.420]   well, Windows 7 is gonna be a platform.
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.420]   And then you have Windows Phone 7,
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.820]   - Oh dear. - Which is not the same thing.
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.420]   And then-- - Oh dear.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:13.620]   - Then you have somebody built on Windows compact
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.020]   embedded, whatever it's called.
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.980]   They built a UI, a couple of guys from Microsoft
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:20.620]   that looks like Windows Phone 7.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.700]   But it's not, it was just for demonstration purposes
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:26.300]   to show people what they could do with this platform.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:30.700]   So that really confused strategy on tablets from Microsoft.
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.220]   - Well, everybody else was like,
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.260]   here's Android on a tablet, but it sucks.
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:37.340]   - The guy at Microsoft J. Allard who shepherded Xbox
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:42.300]   and then Zoon left, he says, you know, to have a life.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.260]   Some say because courier didn't happen.
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:45.820]   You think that's credible?
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.540]   - Certainly possible.
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:48.980]   I mean, courier was real.
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:49.900]   It was-- - It was real?
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:51.020]   That wasn't, see, I always thought,
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.380]   oh, this is just a concept video they never were doing.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.020]   - Well, the concept video was a concept.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.740]   Obviously it wasn't real. - The idea for the product
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:59.380]   was real was being worked on in Microsoft.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:03.220]   I've talked to very good sources that say,
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:06.420]   it was real, it was in a lab somewhere being--
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.380]   - It was a two page tablet.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:11.980]   It was very cool and some neat ideas in terms of UI.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:13.620]   - Really great at UIGs.
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:17.860]   I think what happened is one of two things happened, I think.
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.780]   They couldn't get it there, right?
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.780]   They couldn't get it to where it needed to be
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:23.780]   after a lot of trying and they said,
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.100]   well, we gotta can this thing.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:28.300]   Or they just didn't wanna have yet another platform
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.740]   to support because inevitably,
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.780]   if you do this crazy new UI, you have a new platform
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:34.580]   to support and maybe they didn't feel the market
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.220]   was big enough. - Right.
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.460]   - I mean, the crazy thing about tablets is,
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:41.700]   Microsoft was there, they were in the market.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.660]   They were-- - They're big places.
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.340]   - They thought it was the next big thing.
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:47.980]   - Right, well, so, so, Balmer talked about how
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:49.940]   with the phone, with the iPhone and phones,
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.260]   they missed a cycle and now they're playing catch up.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:55.740]   So they've done exactly the same thing with tablets.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.420]   They missed a cycle.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:00.380]   If the courier isn't happening or something like the courier,
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.220]   soon, and as far as we can tell,
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:03.940]   based on what we saw at Computex,
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:05.620]   it's not because what they have at Computex
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.540]   was like Frankenstein stuff.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:11.340]   So if it's not happening soon, then they're missing the cycle.
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:12.500]   Apple's already sold 2 million,
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.540]   now they're not defining this new market of tablets.
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.180]   Most people didn't know what a tablet was
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:20.700]   before the iPad and now almost everybody knows
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.260]   and a lot of people are buying them.
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.820]   So they'll sell another five million, six million,
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:27.860]   10 million before Microsoft even gets in the game.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:28.700]   - Oh boy.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.420]   - So they did it again, they missed a cycle
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.140]   and it's a huge setback for them and it's weird
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.940]   because they wanted to do this for so long.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:34.780]   - They invented it.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:36.860]   Bill Gates been pushing it for 10 years.
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.900]   - I wonder if they hesitated about the pen input,
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:41.860]   which is a big part of the game.
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:43.620]   - They love the stylists.
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:46.020]   They love the-- - Bill Gates loves the stylists.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.460]   - He's so wrong and he's so wrong.
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.660]   - I don't know, 'cause the courier had the option, right?
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:53.220]   You could use your fingers or you could switch to a pen
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.940]   and it has to be a definition.
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:55.660]   - A Windows 7 has touch.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.900]   So Windows 7 can do, and it's multi-touch.
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:00.540]   - I mean, it's the pen input is,
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:02.220]   I think it's a good idea.
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:04.460]   Yes, include pen input, make it great.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:07.220]   Two touches well, make that great
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.140]   and you've done something that Apple hasn't done.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.100]   You have a-- - 'Cause opportunity--
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.100]   - As much as Bill likes the stylist Steve hates it,
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.900]   does not like the stylist.
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.260]   - Well, if you see a stylist, you blew it,
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.820]   you all know that. - Yep.
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:21.260]   - Oh boy, I use the stylist on the iPad quite a bit.
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:22.740]   - You use that Pogo? - Yep.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:26.620]   - I bought one and I have it, I found I don't use it that much.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:27.940]   - He's kinda not that good.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:28.780]   - No.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.340]   - 'Cause he's got a little puffy on the end of it.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.340]   - It's not-- - It's a press.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:32.460]   You have to press really hard.
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.700]   Do you find that Julio?
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:38.020]   - Well, I'm a horrible, neat Nick
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:43.020]   and I have my moments where the smudginess on my iPad screen,
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:44.140]   I just-- - It's disgusting.
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.180]   - I'm just about to lose it and I just,
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.100]   for sanity's sake, I just-- - It's truly--
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:50.500]   - Pugo, yeah. - Julio is actually Oleophobic.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.740]   He's the Oleofob. - That's right.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.660]   - Yeah, that is kinda gross, you have to carry.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.660]   By the way, oh look, the hoodie is now $1,025 on eBay.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:02.380]   And 15% goes to the EFF.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:06.020]   - Wow, I'm not gonna, yeah, it's pretty cool.
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:07.020]   - I did it.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:09.060]   - Pretty cool, that lining, it's kinda neat.
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:11.580]   - Well, my main talent question and I'm wondering
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:14.580]   what you guys think is, is everybody just,
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.380]   is the main thing happening here?
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:19.900]   Is everybody just scrambling and retrenching
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:23.220]   because of the iPad, Lenovo Slate?
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.700]   - Yeah, remember that UX1 that they showed at CES,
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.500]   Lenovo UX, which is cool, but gone.
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.140]   - And you know what the answer is?
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:33.340]   - What HP said about the Palm purchase,
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:38.140]   the CEO says it's not about getting into the smartphone market.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:39.260]   - They got back. - They do it beyond that,
[01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:40.940]   but-- - They keep going back and forth.
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.220]   They can't decide. - They're backtrack, yeah,
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:44.580]   they're killing the slate, we're not killing the slate.
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.540]   WebOS is for-- - But they said,
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:47.660]   you said really clearly, right?
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:50.180]   Mark, he was like, I don't know why people don't get it.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:53.820]   We bought, we bought Palm for WebOS to put on slates.
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:55.660]   You know, I think they're just trying to push it
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:57.700]   and say, yeah, we're gonna do smartphones,
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:59.300]   but look, we're getting in this game big time
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.100]   and we have a great OS for it.
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:03.740]   But yeah, I think, Julio, to what you were saying,
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:07.180]   people are scrambling now.
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:10.380]   Everybody said, no, it's the same thing with the iPhone.
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.820]   People said, well, Apple's not just gonna walk in here.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:14.020]   Remember Palm? - Right.
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.100]   - Apple's not gonna get it. - Whoops, whoops.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:17.620]   - Do you use this thing? - But that is my question.
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:20.300]   The question to you, how much of the Apple factor
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:23.500]   is to blame for the career being killed?
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.580]   Do you have any idea?
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:27.660]   - Why was the career killed?
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:29.140]   - I think that it must have been,
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:32.620]   if the career was a great product,
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:34.020]   I'm having trouble believing that they got it
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:35.900]   to be a great product, that's my theory, okay?
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:37.100]   - I just couldn't get it to work.
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:39.020]   - And I think that has a lot to do with the shakeup,
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.140]   sort of, and not just the career,
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.300]   but a lot of things, the kin is a good example.
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:45.900]   I think Microsoft has somehow gotten mired in a really,
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.820]   I mean, they always have a problem with direction,
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:50.500]   but now it seems sort of worse than ever,
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.020]   and they've got, they release,
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.980]   they talk about this great new phone platform,
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:56.620]   it's gonna integrate all of these services like Xbox,
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.660]   and then a few months later, they say,
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:01.620]   oh, we also have this other new phone platform,
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:02.820]   and it doesn't do all that stuff,
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:03.780]   it's built on the same thing,
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.140]   but it's not the same thing, and they're miserable,
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:08.020]   they're not good phones.
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:10.740]   And I think that the courier might have been part of that whole,
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.900]   can't get a foothold, can't find their bearings,
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.500]   just like directionless stuff,
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:20.060]   and they need to change, they need to execute,
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.660]   you heard what Ballmer said at D,
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.780]   he said, we learned a lesson about not executing
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:28.380]   with the iPhone, and with what Apple did,
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.220]   they really actually, - Really not.
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:32.540]   - Oh, maybe now they're getting it, I don't know,
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.740]   but again, they miss a cycle, so.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:37.060]   But I think Apple has a lot to do with,
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:39.180]   I don't think they react to Apple necessarily,
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:41.820]   or they do, they're just really, really slow to react,
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:44.540]   but everybody else reacts, and everybody is reacting.
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:45.780]   - There's so much more to talk about,
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.780]   but I don't wanna keep you guys any longer,
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:48.780]   what do you like my shirt?
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:50.260]   - I love this shirt. - Is that good?
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:51.380]   - Did Dig make that for you?
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:54.780]   - No, I made it, Dig 4 was my idea, you know why?
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.700]   'Cause it was my idea, but that's a story for another day.
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:00.060]   Kevin says he will come on when Dig 4 comes out,
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:02.420]   and he will demo it for us first on Twitch,
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.700]   which might be as soon as next week,
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.220]   I'm not sure exactly when.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:07.220]   So I got these, somebody sent me these T-shirts,
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:10.060]   because I told Kevin this, I said,
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:11.460]   two years ago I told Kevin,
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.060]   I don't care what other people dig,
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:16.700]   I wanna follow people like Mark and Julio and Josh,
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:18.900]   and those digs, those are the ones I care about,
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.940]   not the dweeb's who, you know,
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.380]   look, Super Mario Kart 15, he's out,
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:25.580]   I don't care about that, so.
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.220]   That's what I think Dig 4 is gonna do, is gonna follow.
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.140]   - I like the idea that it actually,
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.900]   you tell it your Facebook account,
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:34.540]   and your Twitter account, and it just goes in there.
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:35.380]   - Yeah, it goes in there.
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.940]   - It's your social graph,
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:37.780]   that's whatever it does.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:40.580]   - It sounds like Buzz, like, solve a sudden--
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.500]   - But Buzz doesn't organize any of it,
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:45.260]   they just spew it out there like Twitter does.
[01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:49.380]   It seemed like their concept was to take all of this data
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.220]   that you're putting out there,
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:53.660]   and kind of put it in a logical, readable stream,
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:55.980]   but they haven't gotten that far.
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.580]   - I love Buzz, and I'm gonna hang out Buzz forever,
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:00.940]   and-- - I don't get it, how why?
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.780]   - 'Cause it's better than Twitter.
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:05.860]   - Well, I've been getting into Buzz a lot lately
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:07.740]   for a couple reasons, it's in TweetDeck,
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:10.340]   so that makes it a little easier for me.
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:15.180]   I fired up the secondary Gmail account
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.540]   that I don't use for my primary,
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:18.860]   but that's where my Buzz is,
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:20.660]   I fired that up in Mail app,
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:23.540]   and then the other thing I'm looking forward to
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:25.540]   is on posters or postures,
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.580]   or some debate about the pronunciation.
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:32.060]   Within the, when you post on it,
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.700]   you can automatically push your content
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.660]   to different places,
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:35.940]   and Buzz is in one of those right now,
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.820]   but it's going to be really soon.
[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:42.820]   And so those three things are kind of making me revisit Buzz
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:44.220]   and use it quite a bit lately, something.
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.340]   - So here's the deal, I would like Buzz a lot.
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.500]   I like a lot of the technology.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:50.460]   I would like Buzz a lot more if it were,
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:53.220]   I don't want my Twitter stuff,
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:55.140]   or my conversations with people
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.580]   to be connected to my email account,
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.420]   or any of my personal information.
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:01.940]   I don't want it to look at my location unless I tell it,
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:02.860]   I don't want it to do,
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:04.540]   and I know you can opt out of all that stuff now,
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.700]   but the idea that it's in my inbox
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:09.140]   is so deeply unattractive to me
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:11.980]   that it makes me not want to use the service at all.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:14.100]   Now I would use it if I could go somewhere,
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.140]   it had its own portal,
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.820]   it was separate from all of my stuff,
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.620]   I logged in like I do with Twitter,
[01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:20.100]   and I could have conversations in there,
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.540]   separate from all of my personal information,
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:24.580]   separate from my email contacts,
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.420]   unless I wanted it.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.620]   It just feels way too connected
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:30.820]   to my other stuff, to my personal stuff, which is--
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:33.180]   - And I agree with you 100%.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:35.900]   That's why I have my Google Apps domain customized email,
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.140]   and that is my primary email,
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:40.380]   and then this other generic email,
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:43.540]   it's my Google Reader and my Buzz, and that's it.
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:44.540]   - I have the same thing,
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:46.900]   but it's then I have to go back and forth between.
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.740]   I have to be in that inbox at some point,
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:50.940]   which just seems crazy to me.
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.580]   Why not make Buzz a service like Twitter?
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:54.220]   I mean, you have the technology,
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.780]   say, you know, just make it separate.
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.620]   - Well, there is just a setting that says,
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.260]   don't put buzzes in my inbox,
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:01.660]   and then you set that in the--
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.860]   - And if you're using it in TweetDeck or Cismic, it is.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:04.700]   It is a service.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:07.100]   - Yeah, I don't have the same issue, but--
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:08.420]   - Yeah, maybe I'll revisit it.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:09.420]   - I have a little-- - Here's another tip,
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:12.620]   if you can't stand staring at that Buzz 100 plus
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.500]   below your inbox that I found last week.
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.300]   You can just drag Buzz down into your labels,
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.260]   and it hides it.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:19.660]   - Oh, it's just a label.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:22.020]   So you just take that and you drag it down here,
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:24.500]   and you put it there, and then you don't see it anymore.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.020]   So if I want it there, 'cause I click the Buzz more often,
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:28.660]   then I click the inbox.
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:29.940]   - I'm a little slow on the uptake, by the way.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:32.460]   I just started using colored labels and Gmail, so.
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:34.020]   - Oh my god, colored labels is--
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:35.020]   - Huge, huge.
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:38.140]   - Oh my god, it's like, I have so many crazy, customized.
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:40.140]   I mean, when I scan my email now,
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.180]   I don't even look at the label name.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:43.020]   - Just the color.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.260]   - I'm just a couple of colors, yeah, it's so helpful.
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.940]   - That's interesting, see, I think one of the reasons
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:48.180]   maybe you guys don't like Buzz so much
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:50.100]   is 'cause you love Gmail so much.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.260]   It's like, you don't wanna,
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:53.300]   you put peanut butter in my Gmail.
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:54.140]   - It's true.
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:56.740]   No, I like Buzz because it is in Gmail.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.820]   - See, I'm the opposite.
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:00.700]   I like Gmail as this sort of, it's pure experience.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.100]   - Keep it pure, keep it pure.
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.140]   - Email experience, yeah.
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.620]   - Yeah.
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:06.900]   All right, well, we're gonna run because,
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:08.940]   I don't know why, 'cause I could go on for hours,
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:12.180]   but people seem to tell me that that's maybe a little too long,
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:13.860]   but boy, I love having you guys on.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:17.380]   Please come back, Mark Millian is with the LA Times.
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:21.020]   You can read him online, and his website is markmillian.com.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:25.540]   Follow him on Twitter @markmilian.
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.380]   - Awesome.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:27.220]   - Thank you for coming up, Mark.
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:28.100]   - I'd like to see you again.
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.300]   - Oh, he's great to be here.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:34.140]   - Mr. Julio Ojeda Zapata is at the Pi Press,
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.020]   which I love that.
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:36.780]   That's a great name for it.
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:39.580]   The St. Paul Pioneer Press,
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:44.580]   you can follow him online at yourtechweblog.com,
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:46.860]   and he's Joe Heda.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.700]   - J-O-J-E-D-A is a Twitter.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.540]   - On Twitter.
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.180]   Is it Ho Heda or Joe Heda?
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:53.100]   - It's the first initial last name.
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:53.940]   - J-O-Heda.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:55.100]   - Ho Tau Heda.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.860]   - Ho Tau Heda.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.700]   - Nice to see you again.
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:00.500]   - You pronounce my name amazingly well, by the way.
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:03.020]   - You know, I should do it like they do it sometimes
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.220]   in San Francisco because they're trying to be very, you know,
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:06.420]   hip and Latino.
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:08.020]   They'll roll the odds.
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.820]   I could go, Julio Ojeda Zapata.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:11.740]   Would that be better for you?
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.580]   Would you be happier?
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:13.420]   - Very impressive.
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:14.260]   - Yeah.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:15.620]   - By the way, I've been lined with a secret tribe
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.300]   called the Twitter Ekins, which is the Twitter using.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:19.460]   - That's good.
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:22.780]   - And shout out to the mayor, Rafi Mediavilla.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:24.500]   - The Twitter Ekins.
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:26.540]   - I'm also a member of.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.100]   - Yeah, of course you are.
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.740]   Topolsky, that's a great Puerto Rican.
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:30.860]   - Very Puerto Rican, hey.
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:31.700]   - Yeah.
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.900]   - Josh Topolsky is the editor in chief of Engadget,
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:36.180]   the gadget blog as far as I'm concerned.
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:38.540]   And also host the Engadget podcast.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.540]   Where can we find that Engadget podcast?
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:41.380]   - Well, it's on iTunes.
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.460]   We put it up inside every week.
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.460]   We also do the Engadget show, which I don't know if you've seen,
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.780]   but it's a monthly live show with guests,
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.580]   luminaries from the tech world.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:51.260]   - You do that on Ustream, right?
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:52.780]   - We do the Engadget show.
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:54.900]   We stream, no, using bright codes.
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.100]   And then we also put it up on iTunes and show.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:57.940]   - Oh, okay.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.300]   - So we do the podcast and the show,
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.220]   and we have short segments where we go on location places.
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:03.060]   - Oh, very cool.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:03.900]   - It's time.
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.180]   See there's one right there, we interviewed--
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:06.580]   - John Rubenstein, the shift to five.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:07.420]   - The first one.
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:08.260]   - Yep.
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.100]   - We're just about to do our 10th show.
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.740]   So we do one a month, we have a live event
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:13.220]   at the time center in New York City.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.300]   We get an audience.
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.820]   - Oh, that's really neat.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.140]   I like that.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:19.340]   Find that in gagit.com as well.
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:20.180]   - Yep.
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:21.060]   And thanks for having me.
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.380]   - Josh, it's really nice to meet you.
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:24.260]   Thank you so much for coming in and being a part of the show.
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:25.740]   We really appreciate it.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:26.820]   - Glad to be here.
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:27.980]   - Thanks to all of you for watching.
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:31.460]   We do do Twitch and again, dig four.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:32.460]   It was my idea.
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:35.780]   We do do Twitch every Sunday around three o'clock,
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:37.420]   Pacific time, 6 p.m. Eastern.
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:40.580]   That's 2200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:43.980]   And then you could subscribe whenever you're in the mood.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:48.300]   On iTunes or the Zoom, best thing to do is go to twit.tv/twit.
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.980]   And that'll give you all the information you need
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:53.540]   about getting the show in video or audio
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:57.820]   or on YouTube, youtube.com/twit.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:59.260]   We will be back tomorrow.
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:00.500]   For those of you watching live,
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:03.080]   we're doing a special edition live show,
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:08.080]   Tom Merritt, Alex Lindsey, Andy Inaco, Don McAllister,
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.820]   and Becky Worley all will be covering WWDC.
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:16.820]   Becky John, I'm sorry, Becky, Andy and Don
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:20.580]   will be in the hall, blogging live.
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:22.160]   Andy and Tom will be here in our studio.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:27.160]   We begin that at 942 a.m.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:32.820]   Pacific time, that's 1242 eastern at live.twit.tv.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:35.260]   So if you're interested in what Steve has to say,
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:36.140]   there's no video.
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.860]   I wish they would stream video of it.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:38.760]   They don't stream video of it.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:39.900]   So you just have to watch,
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.060]   and gadget will be live, blogging, I'm sure GDGT,
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:43.420]   all the other sites, but we will,
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:46.500]   we kind of aggregate it all into one big mishmosh
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.460]   so you can find out what's going on.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.300]   Thank you for being here.
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.140]   We'll see you next week.
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:52.140]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:55.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:00.720]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.720]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:16.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.560]   (buzzing)
