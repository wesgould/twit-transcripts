[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   the latest tech news of the week and week.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We've got a big week, so that's why we have a great panel starting with the throbbing Joshua Topolsky.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Easy.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Easy, I like it.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Maybe if I don't say anything, we'll just go away.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Editor-in-chief of engadget.com, he seems to be siloning a little bit.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Just a little bit, just for you.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   He's a little throbbing.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Great to have you Joshua.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It was a big week for iPad 2.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   We'll get his take on that.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Matt Mullen-Wake is also going to join us a little bit later on.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   He's the CEO of WordPress.com and they were attacked by the Chinese.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We're going to get the details on that also in studio with me.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I'm very pleased to welcome John C. Dvorak and his hunting gear.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   John, I'm looking for ducks.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   He looks like Elmer Fudd in that flannel there.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I can't do that voice.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Hello.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Be very, very quiet.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I'm hunting rabbits.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   He looks handsome and red.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   That lady is Gina Smith, my old friend, who, you know, she was on Twitter a few weeks ago.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   She's a new editor-in-chief of Bite Magazine at Bite.com, B-Y-T-E.com, which is coming back, I'm happy to say.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yes.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   We're relaunching.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Gina and I wrote, my first book together, she and I worked on.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   She was my co-author, first TV show together, the personal computing show on 1994.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I first radio show.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Your first radio show on computers, which used to be John in my show and you replaced John.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   But here's the thing, John, this is an amazing thing.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I haven't seen Gina in 11 years.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yes.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Is that right?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yes.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   That's not true.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   No one is.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Not since 2000.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   What camera am I on anyway?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I can't figure this out.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   There's no cameras here.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Pay no attention to the cameras.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   We haven't seen each other.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   We've seen each other on video.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I've seen you on video.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yes.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   She looks great.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   She's a great businessman.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Anyway, it's kind of old home week because John and Gina and I worked together.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   We did the first pilot ever for CNET.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yes.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.560]   What a flop that was.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.000]   We also did the first pilot for ZDTV.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Did we?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yes.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I wasn't involved in the virtual.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   We did.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It was around.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It was a discussion.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   No, that was CNET.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   That was all up at Fred Davis.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   That was CNET.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You never did ZDTV?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It was horrible.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   My hair was cool.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   No, I didn't do it all up at Fred Davis.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That was CNET.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You never did ZDTV TV?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It was horrible.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We knew what John could do.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Poorly.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.880]   I will show at the end of the show, I'll show the promo of your trip to Madrid.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.080]   How did you have fun in Madrid?
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.840]   Yeah, I had fun, but I think a lot of the other people didn't.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.440]   I was very disappointed in parts of that event because I don't know that Ford really
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.000]   had that much to do with it.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Really?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.720]   I've got the distinctive.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.280]   I would like to talk to a Ford executive and clue him in on what actually happened.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   Huh.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   A PR guy.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.160]   Well, the idea was this was the Ford Focus Global Test Drive.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   It got to drive a Ford.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.040]   Yeah, and I borrowed one too and I drove it around and it took off.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.320]   They said you may not take it to Toledo, but you did.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   Of course.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.400]   You may not take it to Toledo.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   Why was the point?
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   I didn't get that.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   John's a scofflaw.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   Well, wasn't a law of flan.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   I'm glad you did.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   In fact, we got great video of Toledo.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   That video.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   Ohio.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   Toledo, Ohio.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   It's actually pronounced Toledo.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   Toledo.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   It's a big drive, Joshua.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   It's a law of Europe.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   That'd be huge.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   It's long haul.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.120]   This just in, the internet is down again in Libya according to Google tool.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.760]   8 AM GMT, which was late last night Pacific time.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.360]   The Google monitoring tool shows the internet shut off.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   I'll tell you.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.760]   Isn't it interesting?
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.560]   This is what dictators do now.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   It's disturbing.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.360]   They could say, well, it's trouble just by having everything run by AT&T.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.360]   They hate the internet.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.360]   All their connections.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.280]   That's what they should have done.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   Use AT&T.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.880]   Yeah, they just hire AT&T to run their internet and then they don't have to run around pulling
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   up holes.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   Wow.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.520]   This is the second time.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.520]   Dictators hate the internet.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   They do.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.760]   They really feel like that's going to stuss slow things down, right?
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.600]   If they cut off their internet.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.880]   Like the rest of the internet is working.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.720]   What was the first thing in the old days, the first thing that you would do if you were
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.200]   going to do a coup is you seize the television station.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   And the radio station.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   Central TV and the radio station.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.000]   And you start, you kill a bunch of people.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.080]   Now you shut down the internet.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.200]   They still kill people, but the shutting down of the internet seems to be the new kind
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   of ritual.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   I don't think it does anything.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.440]   I'm assuming that everybody's as connected as we are in California, it seems to me.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   I think it's going to Twitter or Twittering.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   Let's stop the internet.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.120]   I agree with John.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.780]   I mean, this is a question I was talking about with some of the editors at Engadget
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.760]   and my wife who is also an editor.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.240]   But we were talking about, you know, is it our perception of these revolutions that we're
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.400]   seeing it all happen on Twitter and Facebook and that's where it's happening or is it just
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.640]   that we're seeing it like that?
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.160]   I feel like in a way it is that like most of the people taking to the streets are
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.840]   probably not tweeting about it.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.480]   You know, they're probably probably don't even have a phone that it can tweet.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.240]   I mean, you know, maybe I'm making the generalization here, but I think that some part of this is
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.520]   just perception, right?
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.280]   The government wants you to perceive that they're like locking things down.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.840]   And then I think it's also from us, we're getting the idea that it's all happening online
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.920]   when this stuff is actually happening in the streets.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.720]   It's happening in their houses of parliament or what, you know, they don't have houses
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.960]   of parliament there though.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.600]   I guess they're houses of dictatorship.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.920]   The left bathroom and the right bathroom of more Mark Gaddafi's palace.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.760]   I mean, this is really happening.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.840]   Like, you know, there are people dying right now.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.400]   They're not people aren't like tweeting, Hey, I just got killed.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   You know, they're not.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.920]   It does diminish it a little bit to say it's a Twitter revolution.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   And the other thing that can.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.240]   On the other hand, obviously, Gaddafi feels like it's important to shut off the internet
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.120]   as did Hosni Mubarak in Egypt because it's being used what to organize.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.720]   I think they might be used to organize Congress, but I think it's in the other hand, they
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.200]   don't know what's going on and they just shut down everything.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   That's all they can.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.920]   But I'll tell you something else that bothers me just to interrupt for a second.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.080]   They show these videos that people are taking with these camera phones and I'm not seeing
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.720]   anything but a lot of blurring motion.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.800]   They got the video cameras waving all around and it's like you can't see anything and people
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.080]   are supposed to be being shot and run down and gunned down and shot by airplanes.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.480]   I think it's the fault of the cell phone makers.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   They need to get better.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.360]   It's more stable cameras on their phones.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.800]   I mean, maybe they could hold it still for one second.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.160]   Josh makes an excellent point.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.080]   And that's countries where people don't know what the internet is.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.360]   You get it in North Korea.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.040]   They've never permitted internet access to any other citizens and nobody even knows
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.200]   what it is.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.640]   They don't have a scale on the Google monitoring tool.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.440]   I don't know if these are megabytes, terabytes, gigabytes, petabytes.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440]   40.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.440]   It says 40.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   40, 30, 20.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.120]   I'm going to think that's gigabytes.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.720]   No, I doubt it.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.760]   It sounds like a just a number football field to me.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   I don't know.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.000]   But it does drop off quite completely.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.800]   I, you know, this kind of sounds kind of silly, but I have to assume that the dictators
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.600]   know their job.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.120]   And if they're shutting off the internet, it's because they, they, they, I mean, I'm
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.760]   sure they're also shutting down cell phones so people can't text one another.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.920]   But it's got to be because there is some threat to them from the internet, don't you
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   think?
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   You know what they, it is really also about it's not just, it's not just inbound or, or
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.760]   it's not just, I think it's, it's people keeping people off.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.960]   It's not just people not seeing Facebook and Twitter.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.040]   It's keeping people from posting videos from letting the world know.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.520]   I mean, a lot of the way in the news, I mean, don't you think that's something you're
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   trying to stop?
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520]   Exactly.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.000]   People reading the New York Times going, Hey, look at this.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Exactly.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.240]   You know, we're making waves.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.720]   There was some complaint early on in Libya from the protesters that there, the Western
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.000]   world wasn't watching in the same way that they were watching Tunisia or Egypt.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And without the pressure of the Western world on Gaddafi, he doesn't, you know, if he, if
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.040]   he were operating alone inside his own borders without anybody paying any attention, he could
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.200]   do whatever he wants, right?
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   I mean, that's what, that, isn't that what happened in Cambodia?
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.520]   That's exactly what happened in Cambodia, which you said, I mean, in the old days, they just
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.080]   shut down the newspapers.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.960]   And they can operate with free rain.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   That's it.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   That's what they've done.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960]   And it's it working?
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   Well, we don't know.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.720]   I mean, it's not, it's a nasty scene in Libya right now.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.720]   It's very sad.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720]   It doesn't seem to be working.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   Yes.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.280]   It's weird that we went from Gaddafi was a kind of funny a few months ago.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.280]   You know, funny.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.680]   He showed up at the UN.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.040]   And now he doesn't seem that funny.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.920]   He actually seems like a pretty terrible person, which has kind of has always been the thing
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.920]   with him, right?
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.800]   And terrible for a while.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.960]   Terrible and a little crazy.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.720]   You know, some of this comes from our own, our own US and for those of you listening outside
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:16.340]   the US, you know, well, it's our own federal government, which confuses us as US citizens
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.580]   because we have some interest in Egypt.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.800]   We have some interest in Libya.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.760]   You know, we let Gaddafi off the hook for the KAL bombing.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.400]   You mean the Scotland Wallachian.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   You mean Pan Am.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   Pan Am, I'm sorry, Lockerbie.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:39.160]   No, not KAL, Lockerbie because we wanted to treat with him, even though he's a nut bag.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.600]   And so some of this confusion, I think, comes from the fact that the US government doesn't
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.480]   seem to know who's good and who's bad.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.520]   It's your chat going crazy right now.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.480]   I'm not watching it, but this is we're getting really political.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.720]   And yeah, this sounds like no agenda.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.880]   All right, let's change.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.880]   Let's change.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   Let's talk about it.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.880]   I think it's interesting.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   It must be stopped.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.080]   We got to stop the US.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.400]   I'm being lazy about dictators.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.000]   Well, you know, geopolitics is tricky.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.560]   For instance, Egypt, you keep on their good side to protect Israel, right?
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.600]   We give them more than $2 billion a year.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.720]   They're the number two recipient of US foreign aid because it's a payoff, basically.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   That's insane.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   But that's insane, isn't it?
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.880]   It's a payoff.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.440]   That sounds crazy.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.360]   We're paying them off to protect Israel.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.520]   Yes.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.400]   That whole situation sounds crazy.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.840]   Like, if we don't keep giving them the money, they'll just go ballistic.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   Yes.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   Let them dig a hole now.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   I'll just watch.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.120]   Yeah, really, we should leave this in the house.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   Let's go.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   Let's talk about the New World.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.680]   John C. Devorak and Adam Curry.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.360]   From now on, listen to know you want politics, listen to no agenda.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.400]   We don't really do politics on no agenda.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.000]   We just do deconstruction of news stories to prove that public relations companies are
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   behind most of the news.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   That's true.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I love that.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   I got to listen.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I got to watch.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Yeah, it's a good show.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   No agenda, Doc.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   No agenda show, Doc.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I'm endorsing that based on the idea.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   That sounds great.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   That's all you need.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.080]   In fact, you don't have to listen to show it all, Josh.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   You pretty much, that's it.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.080]   Yeah, you got it.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.080]   I got it.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   I got it.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.080]   I got it.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.080]   I got it.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.080]   I got it.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   I got it.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   I got it.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.080]   I got it.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.080]   I got it.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   I got it.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   I got it.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   I got it.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   I got it.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   I got it.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.080]   I got it.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   I got it.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.080]   I got it.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   I got it.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080]   I got it.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.080]   I got it.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.920]   I got it.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920]   I guess you won't be going back.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   Is it only the one?
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.920]   Leo got thrown out.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.920]   Do you know?
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   No, I'm thrown out.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   I did not get thrown out.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   But you have not been invited back.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   I've never again been invited back.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   Apple and I have both been invited back.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   That's the same as being thrown out, Leo.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.640]   It's post facto being thrown out.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.640]   You've been disinvited.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.640]   Uninvited.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.960]   But in fact, no one has ever contacted me from Apple or asked me about it.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.840]   No one at the time told me to stop.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.480]   There was nowhere on the badge that said you may not stream.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.480]   Did you try?
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.640]   There were all these cameras in the room.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   I thought, well, everybody else is broadcasting.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.360]   Did you try to get into one of these events since?
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.920]   Did you ask them nicely?
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   Can I go, oh, what then?
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.640]   Did you make this up?
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.920]   They used to send me invitations and they stopped.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   Maybe they don't send you.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.680]   They're not sending you an invitation.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.840]   You're not invited.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.440]   You're not something happened.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   That's all.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.200]   Maybe they changed the database and you've been bumped from the list.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.480]   You know, the truth is, it's fun just to bitch about it.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.480]   I don't really care.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.480]   I think that's all you.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.600]   Andy Inaco went and covered it for us.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   I anchored from here.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   It was just fun.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   I anchored from my desk.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.120]   You of all of us here sitting here, you were there.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.120]   So lucky.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.120]   I'm envious.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.120]   You were like, I was at my desk.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.120]   I had no pants on.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.120]   I didn't say.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.720]   I was like, you know, dying.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.360]   The French is trying to elbow people away from the iPad.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.760]   But I went.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760]   I was there.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.160]   So, well, let's start with the back.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   Let's go backwards.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.840]   You actually handled the little thing.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   I did.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   It's nice and light.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   I really handled it.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.000]   It's a little bit lighter.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   It's really thin.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.800]   It's so thin.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.920]   It's thinner than an iPhone 4.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.840]   I expected we knew what it was going to look like.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.640]   We had a few leaks and we had some pretty good idea of what the thing was going to look
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640]   like.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.680]   And I expected it to look how it looked.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.800]   But when you hold it, it really feels nice.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.960]   It gets so, so thin.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.880]   I was more impressed by the way it felt than I thought I would be.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.360]   Is it thin enough so it has almost a knife edge-like quality so you could actually literally
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   cut butter?
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.640]   Can you chop someone's head off with it?
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.320]   I think you could get through just the very first layer of skin.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.920]   I don't know how deep you could get with it.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.920]   It's not sharp.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   You had a paper cut?
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   No.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   If you were to sharpen it, you might be able to do it.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920]   I think that would be cool.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920]   The head chopping.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.760]   Now, would the TSA allow you to have a sharpened iPad 2 on an airplane?
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.760]   That's interesting.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.760]   And Steve Wasey actually has to have a question.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.760]   That's a great question.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.400]   We have an attorney in here.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   What do you think?
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.120]   What do you need to layer now in this show?
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.960]   I don't do anything without my attorney.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.200]   Leo does have an attorney on the show at all times now, which is the weirdest thing.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   What is he?
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   He's such a nice guy.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   He's really going to...
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.040]   He comes over, he whispers in my ear before I make a response.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   I think that's appropriate.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.480]   I'd like the idea that you've now created a new weapon.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.320]   No, I'm just closing on that.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320]   The iPad 2 sharpens.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.400]   You're like sharp at the edges of your new iPad and use it to take over a plane.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.920]   That's what you're basically saying.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.080]   Now I have to say that they did the minimum.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:21.880]   I mean, there were things that they could have included Thunderbolt, USB, SD card, higher
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.880]   resolution screen.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.280]   That's not Thunderbolt wasn't on it.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   Thunderbolt was not on it.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   These are all things not on it.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   All right, I'm sorry.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.280]   I'm not paying it.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.200]   It seems to me they did the minimum they could do to make the old one look obsolete.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.880]   Yeah, I had 1.5.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   That's what I think the best...
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880]   Oh, 1.4.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.880]   I mean, it was on the one way.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.880]   It's 1.3.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   What do you think?
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   Joshua, this is your beat.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.840]   I think the minimum they needed to do to be competitive, I think they made a point about
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.120]   saying we are not...
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.640]   This is not a space race.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.520]   I actually wrote an editorial about this, but this is in a space race.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.360]   We're going to do what we think is necessary for the product and our experience is its
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.840]   experience overall.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.000]   Yeah, they didn't do a lot from a technical standpoint.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.360]   They added cameras.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   They added cameras.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.520]   Well, when you dominate the market, when you own and define the market, how much do
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   you need to do?
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.720]   I mean, I can't even think of a parallel.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   Oh, Google.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   It's like Google.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   It's like Google changing their search algorithm.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.600]   Remember, they just said, "Hey, we're going to try to cut down on spam."
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.440]   But it's like they didn't need to.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.000]   It's probably the bare minimum.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.280]   They're probably doing the bare minimum to cut down on spam.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:29.480]   If you own the market and there is no other name, really, how much do you need to do to
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   stay competitive?
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.840]   Well, you don't need to do anything, really, but just a little bit is enough.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.320]   They did just enough now to say, "Oh, we've got that.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.480]   We've got a dual core.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.480]   We've got cameras."
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.240]   But at the end of the day, what's going to make people walk away with these things and
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.920]   what my experience was playing around with it, some of the new stuff, the garage band
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.280]   that they've done for the iPad, iMovie, the board, some of the photobooth stuff, which
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.960]   is just like if you play with it in a store, you're going to want to leave with it because
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   it just is fun.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.600]   It's just like something that's weird and fun and you can't do on anything else.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.880]   It's funny, photobooth is such a throwaway program.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.720]   It's been on the Mac for such a long time.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.000]   Everybody who has a Mac loves photobooth.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.400]   Anytime you want to show off a Mac, you use photobooth.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.080]   I think never Apple never gave it much love.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.280]   Now I think you're right.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.200]   They realized this could sell a lot of Macs.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.080]   What's the experience of somebody who didn't know they wanted one of these?
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.920]   They go into this store and say, "Oh, I heard about the iPad."
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.720]   They start playing around with these really touchy, feely, very graphic, intense, weird,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.440]   cool, new programs.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.280]   I think that they are just, their whole thing where they were saying, "We love to do apps
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.440]   and here's a couple of new apps.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.720]   We want to challenge other developers."
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.520]   The apps, I played with the garage band on the demo units they had there.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.360]   It's really cool.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.080]   I've made, I used to make music professionally.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.600]   I think it's really, really an interesting piece of software that a lot of-
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.520]   Is it for musicians or for non-musicians?
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.720]   Oh, I think for both.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   That's the thing.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.720]   You can use it if you're a real musician.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.200]   You can totally write on it.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.240]   You can record on it if you're a beginner or an amateur.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   8-track recording.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   It's track recording.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.160]   It's a crazy thing called smart instruments where it'll give you a guitar, it'll give
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.320]   you the neck of a guitar, you can strum it and it gives you your set of your standard
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   chords.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.960]   It's like you're playing the guitar.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.360]   You can create a song that's completely original, but you don't have to actually learn how to
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   play the guitar, which is pretty fascinating.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.040]   You've a fascinating idea.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.040]   Some cool apps.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   The device is thinner.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.040]   It's lighter.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   I'm looking.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   Would you shoot?
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.200]   Hey, Joshua, maybe you know, because Apple was really unclear on this.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.240]   Did you ask them what is the resolution of that back camera?
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.920]   They haven't said.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920]   They haven't said.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.920]   We don't know the number.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.920]   It's that odd that we...
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.920]   What's the eye of the size?
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.680]   Because they say we're in the post-PC era.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.120]   You don't care how much RAM we have, but then they say, but we do have a dual-core processor
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.800]   running at 1.03 gigahertz.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   It's like they decide...
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   They'll announce the good stuff.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   The numbers that they'll...
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   The numbers that they'll...
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   Sounds good.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   I think I was nervous that they haven't revealed the resolution of the camera.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.800]   It sounds like...
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   I think it's...
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   What's the back of the touch?
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   It's probably the same.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.000]   It's not a great camera, but I think it does HD video recording.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   It's not going to look as good as camera back.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   It'll be upscale HD.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.200]   It won't be true 720p if it's the iPod touch back.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.920]   Well, then I think it is going to be true 720p.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.920]   So maybe it's higher res than the touch back camera.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920]   I might be wrong.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   Maybe the touch does...
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.080]   I know they claim 720, but like the flip cam, it's a upscaled 720.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.680]   I don't think they would...
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.920]   I mean, maybe they're upscaling.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   I don't know.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   I mean, on the iPad.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   Well, Steve, here's the thing.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.920]   He would never lie.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   He would never lie.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.320]   Well, let's go over that little issue.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   You said you have...
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.320]   Well, Steve, we never lie.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.320]   Steve, we never lie.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   We're going to get to the iPod touch.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.200]   Let me just look at the specs in the...
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   See if they say on the video.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   No, so they don't...
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   Oh, they do.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   Not sure.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   They just say...
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   960 by 720.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   So it is 720p on the touch.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.800]   No, no, 960 by 720 is not true 720p.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   No, just not.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   Why not?
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   It's not a true 720p.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   Right.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   Right.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   1280 by 720.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   At least 720 lines top to bottom, but you're right.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   It wouldn't be 16 by 9.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.240]   Yeah, so that's actually kind of phony, which is annoying.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.240]   So it probably is the same camera.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.120]   So it's not the iPhone 4 camera?
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.120]   No, absolutely not.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.120]   And that would cost a lot.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   Why not?
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.720]   I'd say you'd want to keep it safe.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   Keep the price down.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.120]   That's a much better camera than the iPhone.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   It's a really nice camera.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.480]   I wish to hell they'd say...
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.280]   I think it's a little funny that they say the specs that they want to say and they...
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.680]   There are a lot of disingenuous things going on.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.120]   They said we're in a post-PC world.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.240]   Except that we have 1.03 gigahertz processors.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.760]   Yeah, and then they announce this case as if it's the newest thing starts.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   It's a revolutionary case.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   Blackberries, how's it?
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.760]   It has been around for 10 years.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   The magnet?
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.760]   Yeah, the magnet.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.760]   It's a cool case, but I mean...
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.760]   It's not a new...
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.640]   The fact they had a video for the case, I thought it was a little over the top.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.640]   I mean, it's cute, but it's just a case.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.640]   It's just a case.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   It's not even a case.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.640]   It covers the front of it.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   No, no, no.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.640]   That's the Apple.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   That's not a case.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.640]   It's just a cover.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.480]   That's the Apple I would be fun because, first of all, none of the existing cases will
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.040]   work with the camera.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.600]   Apple is going to sell every single person who buys an iPad 2 will buy that case at 30
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   bucks.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   It's a rubber and a magnet costs a make.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   It doesn't come with it?
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   No, it's $38 extra.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   They're in the right time.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.480]   They're using the hand.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.040]   It's all profit because it's just a freaking piece of rubber.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.960]   They're getting it for $2 from Shenzhen.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   Probably a buck.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.960]   Exactly.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.960]   Maybe a buck.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.400]   In defense, there are some leather ones, so they have to get the...
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   $70.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.880]   Yeah, those are more expensive.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.040]   But the Blackberries had this for a good...
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   The magnet.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.040]   A good piece.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.040]   And I like that was actually a nice feature of the Blackberry you'd holster it would know
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.040]   it'd be in the holster.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   But the big...
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   That's cool.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   This is as if it was...
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.000]   He also said, and Joshua, you can maybe clarify on this.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.960]   He said, "We are the first dual-core processor tablet to be shipping and volume.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   Is that accurate?"
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   That's ludicrous.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   Yeah, I think he's...
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.000]   That's a little bit of a word play, right?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Shipping volume.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.160]   Well, you have to ask what volume means to...
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   15 million, obviously.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.160]   Absolutely.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.040]   I mean, Zoom has a dual-core.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   It's shipping in volume.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   Matrix has a dual-core.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   The atrix.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.960]   Well, it's not a tablet, but I mean it's a product.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.240]   Now, put out a dual-core streak.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   Months ago...
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   Yeah, the Tegra...
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.240]   That is not in volume.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   Oh, what is volume?
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.240]   They sold...
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   Dell's only sold three of those things.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.040]   Well, that may be true.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   It's actually more like 300.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   So...
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   So I guess volume is whatever.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   It's huge opposite sides.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   It's shipping.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.040]   It's shipping.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   It lets...
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   They're not selling a lot of them, I think.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   It's shipping.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.800]   And Apple is selling a lot of iPads, right?
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   So they get to...
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.240]   And this is the whole thing is the whole...
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.320]   All this post-PC and shipping and volume.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.520]   And we only talk about the specs we want.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.520]   They're basically...
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.720]   You know, it's carte blanche now.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.600]   We want to do because they...
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.120]   When you go to a store, you're not looking for a tablet.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120]   You're looking for an iPad.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   You're looking for an iPad.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   You're looking for an iPad.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.120]   You want the iPad.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.040]   And the other guys have to now say, "We offer something that the iPad doesn't offer that's
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.760]   in a feature that you just have to have some must have."
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.600]   And Apple is basically going...
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   They don't have it.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.600]   There aren't any features.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.760]   And they could boast about specs, but that doesn't matter.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.760]   He was...
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.760]   I have to say...
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.760]   Apple came to Microsoft.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   Apple came to Microsoft.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.760]   I mean, he was kind of a little cocky.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.760]   I mean, he was crowing.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.760]   They don't even close.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   They went way beyond expectations on sales.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.800]   I'm by the way, I know that I'm sure people are like, "What a fanboy."
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.480]   And I wrote this editorial and it was all about how it's Apple's post-PC world and they're
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.400]   sort of selling this idea of the post-PC.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.040]   And it was about really how they're trying to market themselves and how they're trying
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   to market the part.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   It doesn't mean you like it.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   It just means it's an observation.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   This is what they're doing.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   It's the reality.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.040]   They said it as much.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.480]   You know, they said, "We don't...
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.560]   Speeds and feeds.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   We don't...
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   That's the PC model."
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.560]   Well, we do speeds and feeds.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.720]   It fits us, but if you want to know about the camera, well, we don't do speeds and feeds.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.000]   Yeah, Josh, I read your editorial.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.880]   I thought it was dead on.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.000]   Well, and I think that the speeds and feeds is right when they want to talk about something.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.240]   But I also think, you know, looking at it from their perspective, they probably said,
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.360]   "All right, what's the next version?
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.500]   We need a faster processor.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.500]   People want cameras.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.120]   We want to be able to do face time on here."
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120]   I don't think...
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.320]   I think they looked at this from a fairly holistic way and said, "Also, you know, version
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   three is coming."
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.320]   So you have to add some versions.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.360]   Inversion three, this fall, or you think we wait until April for our March next year
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   for version three?
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.120]   That doesn't make sense to me.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.520]   Dr. Groove John Groobber about this, we had a conversation at the event.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.040]   That's sort of his theory, I think, is that there'll be a version in the fall, which is
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.160]   a higher resolution display and some other stuff.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.200]   They're already cannibalizing iPad 1 here.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.920]   I mean, so much so that they're saying, "If you bought one recently, you'll give you
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   a hundred bucks back."
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   Right.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.920]   Right.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.920]   Last two weeks.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.920]   How would it make sense?
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   Tell me what the premise is.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.920]   Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   I'll tell you why.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   In six months or so.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.480]   Here's the only reason I can think of it.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.720]   Is that shipping an iPad in April or March is a bad time to ship an iPad.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   It sure is.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.400]   It kills your Christmas sales because everybody knows, "Well, wait three months."
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.480]   So what you'd like to do is ship into September.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.520]   So I think what they're going to do is a one-time only, they'll take a little hit one time only.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.560]   We're going to, yeah, we're going to cannibalize iPad 2, but we're going to get it out in September
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.760]   for the buying season and we'll be every September from then on.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.920]   Doesn't that make sense, Joshua?
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   I mean, it's possible.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.720]   Why not just wait then keep selling.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   They've been selling loads of...
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   That's true.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   They could have waited, couldn't they?
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   I think they felt like...
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   I think they were threatened a little bit by a general playbook.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.520]   I think they were trying to steal some of the thunder from Motorola by announcing this
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.120]   kind of limited, iterative version of the iPad.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.440]   And it occurred on iPad, it has no way in and no way out.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   It's like the hotel's how it's forming.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.240]   It's not supposed to have a way in or out.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   And no one doesn't either.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.840]   I don't think 4.3 is going to change that.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.880]   Doesn't it seem crazy, though, that they would be threatened by the Zoom when...
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.440]   They're almost in two different categories.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.640]   The Zoom costs minimums.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.920]   You're going to pay $700, $800 or something.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.080]   I think there's a Wi-Fi version they've been talking about that's going to be $599 or something
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.880]   but isn't available yet.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.680]   And the price point is way off.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.800]   They're trying to sell them with a carrier commitment.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   And there's no software.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   I mean, there's literally...
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   I just reviewed the Zoom.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.120]   There were like six apps.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.880]   And some of them, they Google had to give to us.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.240]   They were like, "Here, these aren't out yet."
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.040]   It's a really weird thing where you've got this almost like a beta product.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.720]   The Zoom is very good on the tech side.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.960]   It's great battery life.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.880]   I think the new Android Honeycomb UI is very interesting.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:08.080]   But there is no competition right now between these two products.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.560]   I mean, there are no apps available for the Zoom that are compelling, really, that are
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.760]   going to make you say, "Hey, there's something happening
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.640]   here that isn't the only thing that's happening.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   It's different.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.640]   It's running Android."
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   Really, like...
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.880]   Is it amazing to see Apple competing on price?
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.880]   It's amazing.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.880]   It's amazing.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.880]   So the Apple have to keep this product out there.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880]   It's the beginning of the end.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   It is the beginning of the end.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   It's a new issue.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   They're scared because why on earth when they price it?
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.920]   Well, I think they sense that if...
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.720]   You know, it's very clear when they released the iPad initially, they had to do a very
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.560]   competitive aggressive price because it was a new category.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.160]   And nobody's going to even look at something that they don't even know they need unless
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.040]   it's affordable enough.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:50.720]   They sure killed netbooks with the iPad, but that market to bed completely...
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.200]   Well, that market was really dubious.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.040]   It was a crappy market, I know.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.120]   Well, if netbooks came up, that's what happened.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.520]   I mean, they didn't kill netbooks.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.360]   I mean, netbooks kind of killed themselves.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.360]   That's for sure.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.360]   They had these Linux...
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.360]   I know my netbooks...
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.360]   I don't mind that book.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.360]   I don't mind that book.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.360]   I jumped right off the Gholike Bridge.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.760]   I had a bunch of them.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.760]   Yeah, I did.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.760]   I still have the original.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.760]   You didn't have the OPML or whatever.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   Yeah, the OPML.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.760]   It's the OPML.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.760]   It's the OPML.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   But I have right there.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.760]   This is E.E.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.760]   PC, the very first 7.5 inch netbook.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.440]   It's there for historic...
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   That's historic.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.680]   It's right in front of the original iPhone.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   And the original iPhone.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   It's historic.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.680]   That's a piece of history.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.480]   Some day people will say, "Remember netbooks!"
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.280]   You know, it might be "enthe neck".
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.280]   The NC.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   The Larry Ellison.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   Is it the computer history?
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   BZM.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   I saw something...
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.280]   Gina was the CEO of the company.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.280]   That was wonderful.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.280]   All right.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.720]   We got some more quotes from Steve Jobs, including some even more outrageous lies.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   Outrageous lies.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   Outrageous lies.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   With Leel LePorch.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.520]   He's the Moammar Gaddafi of Technology, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.000]   That's harsh.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   I know, I'm just trying.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   We're definitely...
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   We just trying to live in the show up.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   I'm trying to get some hits here.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   You guys weren't getting a different before.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.520]   You're going to get a bunch of Apple guys on your case.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.520]   All the fanboys.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.840]   Let's talk about this.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.240]   Also, you have a great review of the MacBook Pro.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.440]   In fact, you pushed me over the edge to buy it, so I'm blaming you, Joshua Topolsky.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:12.040]   Well, Neil, I can tell our manager had to do the review, but I asked him to do it.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.360]   We'll talk about that.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.280]   And Scobel says...
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   Scobel says...
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.280]   Scobel says...
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.280]   What does Scobel say?
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.520]   It's a new feature on the show.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   Scobel says...
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.520]   Scobel says...
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.520]   Scobel says...
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.520]   Scobel says...
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.480]   Charlie Sheen is YouTube's big fumble.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.360]   We'll find out what that could be.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.240]   But first, let me talk about GoToMyPC.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.320]   I'm really excited, actually.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.880]   They've got a brand new product, which we were the first to see.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.000]   For iPad fans, and this is the new or the old iPad, GoToMyPC for the iPad is now free.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.240]   And available in the Apple store, that means you can access your PC or Mac anytime, not
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.680]   only from your laptop and from your iPad.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:57.960]   In fact, they've got a great contest, a chance for you to win $10,000 by sharing your 36...
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:04.720]   30-second story at facebook.com/GoToMyPC.

[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.160]   Let me tell you what, first, a little bit about this new...
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.840]   This is a fantastic iPad app that lets you access your computer.

[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.160]   free.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   And so now they put together...
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.880]   Let me type this in here.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.160]   It's facebook.com/GoToMyPC.

[00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   Wow!
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.760]   It's their freedom to let go video contest.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.480]   So the deal is shoot a 30-second video telling your free to let go dream.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:14.320]   Like I would like to be able to access my PC from the Arctic Tundra or whatever it is.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.320]   You have to post it on this page by 11.59 p.m. Eastern time March 18th.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   And what a great prize.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.000]   You're going to announce three finalists on March 23rd.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.080]   And then you got to get your friends and family and community to vote for you because

[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.720]   But the video with the most public votes wins the $10,000.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.160]   And the year subscription to GoToMyPC.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   And have to be your picture.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.400]   It could be puppets, they say.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.080]   Get the puppets out, drawings, animations, stand-ins, your pets.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.640]   We just need the submission in video.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.920]   And it has to be on this YouTube page.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:50.880]   And of course, for the 45-day free trial, go to myPC.com, use the offer code "Twit".
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.880]   This is great software.

[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.360]   And I encourage you to give it a shot for free for 45 days.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:03.760]   Go to myPC.com with the offer code "Twit" and Facebook.com/GoToMyPC for that contest on
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.760]   Facebook.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:11.240]   So Joshua, you actually, you should say you personally.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.280]   But Engadget ran this quote from the vice president of Samsung, Lee Younghe, end of
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   January.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.200]   Oh, we lost him.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.200]   Did you lose him?
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   You lost him.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   You lost him.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   I lost him.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   Let me show the quote.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   That was information week, I think.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.800]   Well, everybody, Wall Street Journal was the first to use it.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.680]   The person whom you're trying to reach is currently unavailable.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   There you go.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.520]   You know, I just think he doesn't want me to ask you about that.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:40.480]   Well, Journal actually was using a translation provided by Samsung.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:47.520]   But this quote that Steve Jobs used on Wednesday was debunked and fixed by everybody, including
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.320]   Engadget in the Wall Street Journal weeks ago.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.040]   She said, as you heard our sell-in, we're talking about the Samsung Galaxy tab, our
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.800]   sell-in was quite aggressive.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.640]   That means John, sell-in means sales to the vent, the dealers.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.640]   Right.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.640]   Channel, channel sales.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   Channel, channel sales.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   Not to end users.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.760]   So as she said, our sell-in was quite aggressive, around 2 million.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:17.360]   In terms of sell-out that is sales from the dealers to customers, she said we believe
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.160]   it was quite smooth.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.520]   Yes, I read it.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   Quite smooth.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   And then he puts-
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.520]   Oh, what did Apple say?
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.760]   What did Steve Jobs say?
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.600]   Steve Jobs said quite small.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.360]   Yeah, that seems to be wrong.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.360]   Quite small.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.520]   It's not the same as quite smooth.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   That's not a bad checker.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.360]   In fact, I would say that's the opposite.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.040]   That's bold even for Apple.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   I think that's the-
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   Steve Jobs-
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   Steve Jobs-
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   Steve Jobs-
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   Willfully lie?
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.920]   No, I think somebody set him up and made a mistake and I bet you they got chewed out
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   like there's no tomorrow.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   He set me up the bomb.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   He set me up the bomb.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.120]   Because that's just too obvious.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.520]   Everybody and their sister will catch this stuff.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.760]   Because let's face it, they catch somebody doing the start-
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   Wait a minute now, though.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.360]   When the badges off a quarter in.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360]   That's true.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.160]   So I think it's not unreasonable to think that he may be when he said we're the only
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.480]   dual processor tablet to ship in volume.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.960]   He said I think at the end of that.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.120]   So maybe that was just a kind of a true limitation.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.200]   That could have been a bad lib too.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.560]   So we'll give him that one.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.920]   In this case, maybe it was just bad fact checking.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.320]   We could give him that one.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   It's not a lie.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   It's just bad fact checking.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.320]   And then he said, in fact, it's a slide here.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.720]   The iPad has greater than 90% market share.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.520]   That's not right.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   There we go.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   Golly.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.520]   That may be true.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.920]   But 90% market share of what market?
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.720]   Maybe he's got super market share.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.200]   Oh, maybe it's like a, well, no, there's a, well, okay.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.040]   So Samsung sold 2 million into the channel.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   Right.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.920]   Apple sold 14.8 million into the channel.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.920]   But that's not 90%.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.840]   You'd have to sell 17.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.840]   Yes.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.840]   Actually 18.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.840]   So that wasn't correct.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   So that's not right.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.560]   Well, this is probably, he's not good at math.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.560]   It's not his fault.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   He's not good at math.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   He is good at math.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   So there's something up.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.560]   Joshua, you're the one to.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   My back.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   My back, baby.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   I am.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.560]   Okay.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   See you guys.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.560]   You should be able to see us soon.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.560]   Actually not us.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.560]   John C. de Vorak.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.560]   Oh, nice.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.560]   Leave it on.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.760]   Get the whole time.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.760]   So you're talking about the quote.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   You fixed the quote.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.960]   You had the bad quote originally because Samsung gave it to you.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   And we also ran a, we ran a CEO know about this.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:26.040]   He's him using this quote, even though it's been proven totally incorrect.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.520]   So one of two things happened, right?
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.720]   Either they are just don't care.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:36.600]   And they just thought it was a good opportunity to take a dig at somebody or they didn't do
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   in their research.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.040]   I think the second is more like bad fact checking.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.240]   I think it's really possible they didn't fact check.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.080]   I think they might have seen to quote somebody ran back with it the second they saw waving
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   it in the air.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   Look at this.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   Look at this.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.480]   So that keynote presentation is prepared weeks ago and they never bothered, you know,
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   saying, oh, it was changed.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.000]   I mean, the whole thing just reeked of PR, the entire announcement from the analysis that
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.920]   were post PC, even the, even that video at the beginning, the self-congratulatory video.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.200]   And all of it, they called jobs at the last minute probably and said, you know, can you
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   make it?
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   Is there any way you can make it?
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.600]   He showed up and he talked to the slides.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.320]   I got to say I'm glad he showed up.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   Yeah, that's good that he showed up.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.040]   Was, was anybody surprised that he showed?
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040]   I was.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   I was.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.440]   I had publicly made the comment just casually.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.160]   On the Dvorak Horowitz show that there's no way he's going to show up.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.680]   He's, you know, he's taken off.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.880]   I mean, what's he going to keep coming in every time they have to announce?
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.800]   I hated when people do that when they retire.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   Like Frank Sinatra.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   And they keep coming back again.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   Well, I was thinking Brett Farr.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   Like the who.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   Like the who.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   Like Brett Farr.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   Like Brett Farr.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   Like what's up.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.480]   So when he came out on the stage, Joshua, were you one of the people that leapt to their
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.120]   feet in Raka's applause?
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.120]   I started.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   I felt it.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.120]   My knees actually tears started to come down.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.120]   This is a journalist.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.600]   A journalist is clapping at this thing.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   No, no, no.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.600]   Let's make this clear.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.840]   It is not necessarily journalists because Apple stacks the first four rows of all these
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.520]   events with Apple employees.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.320]   The cameras are carefully positioned to only show the first four rows.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.240]   You're not hard for the Benny Boop movies.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   Right.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.120]   Joshua, Joshua's actually actively sitting there unmoving.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.640]   This is what Joshua did at the event.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.640]   He just.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.640]   My frozen right now.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.640]   Frozen solid.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   Frozen solid.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   I don't know.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.640]   We have a storm in New York.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   I think that something's happening very bad.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   Global warming.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   That's okay.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.960]   That's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a Libya.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.960]   This might be related to a Libyan.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.160]   Libya is either Libya or A.T.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.960]   Gaddafi has shut the internet off in New York City.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:34.960]   Yes.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.960]   This is painful.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   It's about time.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:42.520]   By the way, you had this story and I'm curious about this too, that there is an in case case
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:48.760]   that looks just like the Apple case, the innovative Apple to smart cover.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.240]   Does the same thing with the triangle and everything?
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.200]   Yeah, somebody's getting sued.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   No, no, no.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.920]   I mean, you know, it's not Steve Jobs fault.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:06.000]   Johnny I've saw this and he forgot he saw it and he designed it for the and then he forgot
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   he saw it.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.400]   So really none of this is Apple's fault.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.520]   Now, an Apple makes like they entered.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.920]   They invented this stuff and everybody forgets all the MP3 players that are around me for
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.920]   the iPod.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.480]   Apple when it comes to this sort of thing.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.040]   Apple's the new Microsoft and was Microsoft like this in the old day?
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   What was it like?
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040]   Grandpa in the day.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.520]   Tell us the way they still are.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.520]   What are you kidding?
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.440]   Oh, they were they were just like this.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.280]   They still are and they still are.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.600]   But no, but the problem with now is nobody's paying any attention.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.600]   Right.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.200]   Microsoft can't get they can't get a break.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.120]   Well, Microsoft is like a hostile takeover of Nokia by basically, you know, throwing billions
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.120]   of dollars at it.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.440]   Let me tell you something.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.440]   Let me tell you something.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440]   I bought.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.000]   I don't know what was that.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.400]   I love how he calls me Josh.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.400]   I like that.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.400]   I got a name for you this week.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.400]   This week's history.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.400]   There's a history.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   This week.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   I don't care.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   I just like the name.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.240]   I think I bought a Nokia N8 phone.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   What am I thinking?
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.040]   What the N8 in the N8?
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.840]   Well, I like it.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.880]   It's a nice new one right this year.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   It's kind of new.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   It came out a few months ago.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   It's okay.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   You had that.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   Yeah, I can't get.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   I've been trying to get it.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   I love Nokia.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   I love Nokia.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.880]   I love this product.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.160]   But I got to tell you, you know, the N8 looked really sweet.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.200]   It's got 12 megapixel camera.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.360]   It's symbion three.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.360]   You know what, Joshua?
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.360]   Symbians history.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   I was a...
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.920]   Remember, I love my cyan 3A.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.720]   I had a cyan 3A for the long term.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720]   You loved everything.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.720]   Let's face reality.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720]   No, I don't love everything.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   Well, at the beginning.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   I do.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   I do.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   I do.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   I do.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   Well, that's only recently.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   I don't love...
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.160]   This is because you'd be making the big bucks and all of a sudden you're getting piggy.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.720]   You still love a bad boy.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.200]   You used to love a bad boy.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   Do I remember you drinking some of the worst?
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   Some of the worst.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   Swill was unbelievable.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   Wow.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.200]   Let's open this bottle.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.360]   Show me a little bit of this bottle.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   I've got this bottle of wine that I found back there.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.760]   The name of it is sustainable red.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.760]   Who are they kidding?
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.680]   This sustainable red.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   It's a bad boy to...
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.560]   Those of us who live in wine country care deeply about monoculture and the future of
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.560]   our environment.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.640]   Aren't grapes just inherently sustainable since...
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.640]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   That's what...
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   Yep.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   But these...
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.640]   These grapes are different according to the back label.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   Carbon neutral somehow.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.640]   I have a lot of...
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.640]   Earth's...
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:14.640]   They don't know...
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   They don't know.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   The packaging.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   100% green power.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.480]   Sustainable farming practices.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   They plow.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.880]   Grapes from family farms.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.480]   What's that got to do with anything locally owned and operated?
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   What is this?
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   It's green wine.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   It's wine is like my water.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.480]   Okay.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   So listen.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   My stuff is coming.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   I bet you the wine is...
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   You want to reboot and I'll do a commercial while you reboot.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   I'm going to switch to LTE and see if it doesn't fit in the mind.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   Oh.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.480]   Shoo.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   Some pop in the ethernet cable.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.480]   And now I can't...
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.720]   I'm not close enough.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.960]   We just moved to a new house.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.960]   I'm on another floor.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   It's a huge mess.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.960]   No, he's complaining.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   I'd love a new house.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.880]   I'm going to try to get on LTE and come back and we'll see if it's any better.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   All right.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.880]   Go ahead.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.880]   You go off.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.600]   John, why don't we open that bottle of sustainable red and see if it's any good.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   They didn't say drinkable.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   They just said sustainable.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.920]   Now Leo, I remember when we were doing a show that whenever we mentioned the word Apple,
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.000]   you used to play taps.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   We had a producer.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.160]   You're kidding.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   Was I that?
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   Skirless?
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.360]   Apple was trading at about $2 a share.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.120]   We were urging Apple to return its money to its shareholders.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   Oh my God.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.240]   And listeners would call in because we had a call in show.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.200]   They would mention Apple and you had some kind of a point you would do and they would
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.440]   immediately start playing taps.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.400]   Da, da, da, da.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.560]   Well, that was in the dim dark days of hair Spindler.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.560]   Gillameelio.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.560]   Dr. Shadak Gillameelio.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.600]   So I think that in some ways I was justified and I have to say that you give credit to Steve
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.040]   Jobs for making that company, taking that company back from the net, don't you think?
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.640]   I was working for Larry Ellison at the time and he used to say, do you think if Steve Jobs
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   came back, Apple could somehow stand up again and you know what?
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.640]   There was no doubt.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.480]   There are enough fan boys out there that would bring Apple back just on that one.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.120]   It's interesting that Ellison saw that coming.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   Ellison saw that coming.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   They were very good friends.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   Oh, are they?
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.760]   I'm probably not allowed to say any of this.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.720]   I've contracted up with Ellison.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   Are you?
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   Where I'm not allowed to speak of him.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   Is that true?
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   Yes, it is true.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   Well, I can say-
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   Shall I ex-urgate, ex-urgate?
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.400]   He's good friends with very good friends with Jobs and he did ask me that.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.440]   Well, he's on the board or was on the board at Apple and he saw it coming.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.040]   This show is ground to a halt.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.840]   We've lost Joshua and Devorek.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.480]   Well, Devorek walked out to uncork a bottle of math.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.400]   Let me call in reinforcements.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   Matt Mullenway.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.400]   What do you say?
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.000]   Matt is Matt finally going to join us.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.960]   Give us a...
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   Well, I'm getting Matt.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.760]   Why don't you tell us what happened this week with WordPress.com.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.680]   Were they D-dossed?
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.840]   Do you have that information in front of you?
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.560]   Well, WordPress was attacked this week, Leo.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.840]   And of course, people are handing me wine here.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:54.360]   At first, people were thinking that it was a Middle Eastern attack of WordPress.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.040]   And then the CEO of WordPress said, "No, no, no.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   It all came from China."
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   By the way, by the way-
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.560]   It came from servers in China.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.920]   These fine glasses were hand-blown by one of our viewers.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.320]   His house has since burned down.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.800]   Oh, that's a shame.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   Yeah, and he...
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.440]   If he's watching, I want him to contact me because he wants to start a phone.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.440]   Give him his glasses back.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.440]   Give him his glasses back.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.440]   Maybe he's on the drink from...
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.440]   His house burned down.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.280]   Let's give him back all of his belongings.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.280]   Let's get Matt Mullenway going.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   Hi, Matt.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.280]   Hi, Matt.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.280]   It's great to have you.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   Hey, Matt, Devorek.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.280]   Hey, Josh.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   Hey, Matt.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.280]   Do you know each other?
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.280]   We do now.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.280]   Would you like a glass of wine?
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.360]   Matt, before he had that crazy beer.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.560]   I like the beard, Matt.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   He just good.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   Brand new.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   Brand new, just as of yesterday.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.560]   It's actually glued on.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   That's how you know about my beard, are you?
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.560]   No, we're talking about Matt Mullenway's beard.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.560]   Matt Mullenway's beard.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.760]   The beard crew is here in the vocal.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.400]   That's a San Francisco joke.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.400]   No one gets it out.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   Oh, we got another beard?
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   Charlie Sheen.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   Matt Mullenway.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.400]   It's Charlie Sheen.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.040]   To talk about the DDoS that happened...
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.720]   In a denial of service attack that happened on a...
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.280]   Well, fill us in, actually.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.280]   What did happen, Matt?
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.280]   Sure.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.920]   So, I guess it started on Thursday.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:13.840]   We had an extremely large, denial, distributed denial of a service attack that ended up taking
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.240]   WordPress.com as many of you guys reported.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.200]   And gigabits of data, right?
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.080]   This one peaked at, I think, six or seven gigabits.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   Wow.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.000]   That's a significant amount.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.320]   I guess you could with a large botnet, you could probably throw that much band with that.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.560]   It actually wasn't the largest one we've seen in terms of bandwidth, but it was pretty
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:42.320]   intense and then a pack it's per second point of view, which ended up overloading some
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.040]   of the routers upstream from us, which is what ultimately took us down.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   How do you get out of it?
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   How do you get out of it?
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.600]   Well, at that level, we don't have a lot of options, but the time it gets to us.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.880]   So really, we work with our excellent upstream providers, Pierre Wan and the technologies,
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.720]   those guys, and they were able to block it before it even gets to our data center.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.680]   Do they throw more bandwidth at it?
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.120]   Because I presume that the originating IP addresses are rotating.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:15.280]   Actually, we ended up blocking about millions and millions of IP addresses to class eight
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.360]   coming from just to make it stop.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:23.040]   So we ended up blocking a lot of IP addresses as a temporary measure, and then they did
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.360]   some more sophisticated filtering of the chat.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   It's far than enough.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:32.960]   Now, tech crunch speculates that most of this traffic came from China.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.200]   Yes, what they said.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:41.400]   And that it was perhaps tied to a blog that the Chinese government didn't like, On WordPress.com.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.960]   It's got to be more than one.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.760]   It's got to be more than one.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.920]   It's got to be more than one.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.240]   You have 18 million sites on WordPress.com.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.240]   This is true.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.280]   I mean, it was from China.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.560]   It is the fact that the majority of the traffic was coming from China.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.080]   However, now that we've dug a bit more into the blog, it appears to be that the attack
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.800]   might have been business motivated.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:08.520]   The website and some sort of gaming website that appears to have no political aspect at
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.520]   all.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   No political aspect at all.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.720]   So, I mean, I don't speak Chinese.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.920]   A competitor or just a...
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.520]   A TypePad takes word press out.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.920]   TypePad wants to regain its form of prominence.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.920]   And now, what is this?
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.360]   This is just collab of damage in this case.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.360]   That's amazing.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.360]   So, Joshua said...
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.360]   Go ahead, say that again.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.000]   Yeah, what is this blog cover that was the target of the attack?
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.960]   I don't know.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:40.000]   I'm just working up Google Translate.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.840]   It's a gaming site.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.560]   It appears to be.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.840]   Yeah, some sort of online gaming Chinese thing.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.920]   How do you know it was that blog that they were attacking?
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.560]   So the first set of attacks we didn't know, it was just a TCP attack at port 80.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.840]   So there was no target information.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.760]   So, they were just throwing it all at wordpress.com.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.800]   Yeah, just at our IP addresses.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.880]   Later, there were, I think, six told the waves of the attacks.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.640]   And one of the later ones was trying to do a resource overload, which included HTTP headers,
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.760]   which made it very easy to see what they were targeting at.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.240]   So that one was more targeted at a particular wordpress.com hosted blog.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   Yep.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.240]   And then I originally thought it was politically motivated because we've had a number of,
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.280]   well, we get DDSs all the time.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.920]   So this happens a lot.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.120]   You know, sometimes a few times a week.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.360]   Most of them are so small, we don't even notice.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.360]   Wow.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.360]   Just because.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.320]   But there was one, another larger one, a few weeks ago against the Vietnamese political
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.320]   sites.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.360]   So thought it might be related to that somehow.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:47.560]   You say you told TechCrunch 98% of the attacks originated in China with a small percentage
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.960]   coming from Japan and Korea.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.760]   Is that still, do you believe still that to be the case?
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.400]   That's what we checked the night.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.160]   Doesn't mean that the, I guess that the originator is in China.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.360]   Could be Russian because the Russians have a lot of it.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.720]   The Russians have a lot of Chinese botnets that they could be in.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.240]   There's apparently in China, they're one of the issues they have because most of the
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.400]   software there is bootlegged.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:13.480]   So there's apparently versions of windows that have built in Trojans and there just
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.960]   must be millions of them that are that they can be turned on by a sense, actually.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.720]   Yeah, it's never needs a copy.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   It's interesting.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.720]   Remotely engaged.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.720]   China.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:28.240]   So the Chinese thing also makes it seem like there's some sort of global political conspiracy,
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.400]   but that's actually not the case.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.480]   I mean, based on what you're saying, I, you know, just, but first glance, like, oh, they
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.480]   originated from China.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.280]   Well, this has got to be, you know, and then like Leo said, was it targeted at a political
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.280]   site?
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:45.520]   It's interesting to hear that it really is not China coming at some political site.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.800]   It's a group of or some gaming people coming at a game.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   Some games in Shenzhen.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.000]   It's so much more right.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Right.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.840]   It's like, that's definitely professional attack.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.920]   The size of the attack would have been very, very expensive to mount.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.200]   So I mean, based on that, it was not an issue.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.240]   We don't have any further details about why or.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.440]   And have you spoken to the, have you spoken to the owner of the site that was attacked?
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.840]   We've tried to, but we haven't heard about you.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.840]   Wow.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.840]   Could be Adiana.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.360]   And he's Chinese is a Chinese site.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   Ad appears to be here.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   Could be redirected through China.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.200]   So, uh, do you ever worried about this happening to you, Leo?
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   Nah.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   I love the Chinese people.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.040]   The Russians that you got to worry about.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.880]   Oh, it's the Russians.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.360]   You're not like Russian people?
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.480]   No, he loves the Russians.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.080]   Oh, too bad.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.080]   He has a hat.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.720]   Oh, here we go.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   Is that made a sable?
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.320]   It's not made a sable and trying to direct the place, Leo.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.840]   Is there a camera pointing at this?
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   Not yet.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   I love Russian people.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.840]   Every one of them is my favorite people's.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:49:00.360]   And John, if you would wear hat on back of a head back there, we will make sure that
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:05.360]   everyone who watches show is a, is a fan of show.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.840]   So now, ladies and gentlemen, I give you John seat the Vorek or comrade.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   Wow.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.680]   So that way, I don't think we have to go full circle back to the political.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.280]   Yes, Matt, if you'd learned that.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.280]   You got a hack.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.160]   I finally found a hat.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.480]   And that's wondering what the hell show he's gotten.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   I know.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   No one's given me a hat.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   So Matt, you tweeted.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.480]   You had food poisoning last night.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   You feel better, though, I think.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   I feel better, Matt.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   100% out of it.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   Thank you.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.200]   Was it something you ate at a restaurant?
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.560]   So I cooked for the first or for the second time yesterday morning.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.560]   So I assumed it was.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.560]   You could have.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   Have you.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   Second time in your life?
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.360]   The second time in your life?
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   Sort of.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.360]   That entirely.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   It makes a lesson.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   It's two different cutting boards.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   One for vegetables, one for the raw chicken.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.320]   If it's bacon, you want to cook it.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.880]   And don't cut the don't cut your lettuce on where you just chopped up a bunch of raw
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   chicken.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.880]   It's kind of a draw back.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.880]   Wash the lettuce.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.880]   Wash the lettuce.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   I assumed it was me because I'm obviously in experience there, but all I made was scrambled
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.880]   eggs.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.520]   No, you can't make yourself sick with eggs.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.520]   Eggs are the silent killer.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   They still get you.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   They speak up on you when you least expect them.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.520]   Sure.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.520]   It's a ball ski.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   Eggs, the silent killer.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   That's funny.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.080]   Matt, well, I'm glad you're feeling better.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.760]   Thanks for WordPress.com.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.720]   And actually I love your blog.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.960]   It's always fun to read it.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   Photo Matt.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   Photo Matt.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   Photo Matt.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.960]   And you're real, actually.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.960]   It's m-a-dot-t-t.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:28.960]   Who is TT?
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.960]   TT is Trinidad and Tobago.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   Perfect.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.360]   Big, special, old, remember the old one.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.600]   Man, it makes me want to change my name to Leo at.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.400]   So is this what you got mad on the line?
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.400]   It should always be.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   Yes.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.760]   I think I wanted to do a double-headed blog.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:48.240]   I want to take a WordPress blog when I host and take two-- what?
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.240]   Leo's moaning about this.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.240]   He's trying to get like three tech support.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.800]   He's trying to get like three tech support.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.640]   So I want to have two blogs on two different sites from the same database with two different
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   front ends.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   Is that doable?
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.360]   Because every time I change to one front end on one, it goes to the database and then
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.120]   it screws up and both blogs look the same.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.880]   John, you need to run that multi-user WordPress.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:07.880]   It's awesome.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.880]   But he wants to see--
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.880]   It's the opposite though, right?
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.480]   Can you do it the opposite way?
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.920]   Well, I'll just send him a note.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   He'll never--
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.920]   I'm trying to make an omelet.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   I want to picture a Tuesday.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.920]   I'll tell you what.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   I'll come over and show you how to cook that.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   I'll do some cooking.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   I'll give you some tips on what I'm--
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.600]   John's a great cook.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   And then you can go--
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   I've heard you're a great cook.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   I am a great cook.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.600]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   We really appreciate it.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   Matt, I hope you feel good.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   No problem.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.760]   John, I'll drop an answer to that in the chat channel.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.240]   I'm in Twit Live 2.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.240]   Oh, wonderful.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   There you go.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   Thank you for joining us there.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   It just grows off.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   What's your handle in there, Matt?
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   A photo mat underscore.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.240]   All right.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.640]   Photo mat underscore, he's going to give John some tips.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.240]   You can say it out loud if it's an easy answer.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:52.240]   Yeah, you can say the tip we could publish it and then gadget later in bite.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   There you go.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   The first tip.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.240]   The first tip.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.240]   At the same time.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   Yes, exactly.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   Which tips from Matt?
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.240]   The new feature.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:03.240]   The theme stores the option in your database.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:06.000]   So when you switch to theme one one, it's going to switch to theme one another.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.920]   What you should do is filter that option using a plugin.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.960]   That way based on the URL or the host name or whatever you're switching on, you can basically
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.640]   filter what theme is active.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   Gotcha.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   So what are you going to do?
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.640]   This is a question.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   I'll work on that.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   I'll work on that little filter.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.640]   Your theme.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   Thanks, Matt.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   I'll do a follow up on that.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   That mollering.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   The best.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.640]   M-A-D-T.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.640]   Be careful what you're cooking.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   Cook safely.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.640]   Hurry up.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   Wow.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.640]   That's a.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.480]   Don't thrive and cook.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   That was fun.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   You're having a Marshall McLuhan or something.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   He's a guy's a celebrity.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.480]   I'm a Marshall McLuhan.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.040]   Do you remember his daughter?
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.040]   You know, I never got to meet her.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.400]   Do you remember she was hanging around for a while and so we all did work.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.600]   She used to be working for CNET for a while.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.440]   Yeah, I remember she signed her dad's book for me.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   As if she were her dad.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.000]   Well, she remembers him.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Well, that's good enough.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   So do I.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.040]   I always like to go to people's houses and then pull out various books from the bookshelf
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:04.120]   and then make some sort of sexual illusion and then sign the book author's name.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.680]   I'll never forget last night.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.680]   Yeah, kind of thing.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.680]   Signed.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   Susan Sontag.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.680]   It's great.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.680]   It works every time.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.680]   It's great.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.000]   It lingers in the bookshelf for maybe years before somebody discovers it.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Somebody notices it.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.600]   You know, I once interviewed Susan Sontag on K&BR radio and it was so embarrassing because
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.800]   she's a great intellectual.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.720]   I'm a mirror, you know, ignorant peasant.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.720]   Who is this?
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   Susan Sontag.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   Oh, she is a great intellectual.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.400]   And I'm interviewing her on a sports station.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   So the whole thing was.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.400]   K&BR.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.160]   Yeah, it was just a nightmare.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:43.680]   This is the days when Leo used to be a regular talk show guy and he has the unusual, he was
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.280]   bumped from his show by Rush Limbaugh.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.280]   I remember that.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.760]   I never forget it.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   That's terrible.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.760]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.040]   He had to rush them both for years, but then we were doing.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.560]   Well, me and 500 other mid-day shows.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.880]   I like to think it's just you.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.360]   And then Rush Limbaugh, I'll say that.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.000]   Rush, no, I'm not.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.520]   Rush then did a promotion for our on-computer show that you'll end up losing.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:12.240]   I once said on the radio, I'm no Rush Limbaugh, which I think is self-evident and somebody
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.000]   took it the wrong way and sent me a note saying, "I'll never listen to you again."
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   Why?
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   Oh, did you remember when we...
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Oh, you're not.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   You wish you were as good as him.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   That's all I was saying.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   I'm not as good as him, but they apparently thought I was like...
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   It's not good.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   You're just different.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   It's a slamming rush.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   You're not even a hyper-conserving.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   You're not a hyper-conserving.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   You're not a better or worse.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   I am...
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   I am...
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   I think it's better.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   It's a hyper-conserving.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   I don't think so.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.200]   I put you in the same league as Rush.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.480]   Oh, I should mention, John, I also got an email the last time I wore that hat from somebody
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.280]   who said, "If you think it's funny to pretend you're a Chinese communist, you've just lost
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.280]   the viewer."
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.040]   The lunatic friends you'll always...
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.040]   They're out there, baby.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   This is a hat.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.040]   This is not Chinese communist.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.040]   This is Berkeley.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.040]   Yeah, that's Berkeley.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.760]   So, if you don't like Berkeley, yeah, maybe you can not watch anymore, but this is Berkeley.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.520]   That really favors you that hat.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.520]   It does look good.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.760]   You ought to wear that around.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.080]   That's one thing about mount caps.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.080]   They look good on everybody.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.080]   This is where I should say it.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.080]   Oh no!
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.080]   We know that.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.080]   You know, we were...
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.080]   And the first time I went to China, we tried to get some of these things.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   You couldn't buy anything like that anywhere.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   It was ridiculous.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   There's a big back on every...
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.520]   I don't know where you even got this.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.520]   I got it in China.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:17.520]   Really?
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.520]   Well, it's made in China.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.520]   No, I got it in China.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.520]   Really?
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.520]   I got it in China.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.520]   Really?
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.520]   Because I could never find...
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.520]   Like everything.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.520]   They'd started...
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.520]   Nowadays, you can get all that stuff.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:28.520]   I got this hat in Russia at St. Petersburg.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.520]   Really?
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.520]   I only wear authentic hats.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.760]   You're like, I'm not going to wear a Mexican hat if it's not actually from Mexico.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.240]   You know where this hat is from?
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.240]   That's got to be from Mongolia.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   It looks like it, but it's Uruguay.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   Oh, right.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.000]   It's an authentic Uruguay.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   They don't have motorcycle helmets.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   This is what they wear.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.080]   What kind of fur is that on there?
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   It's green.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   I know it's a green fur.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   I think it's probably not...
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   It's a black fur.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.040]   I don't wear real fur.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   I should have told you.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.040]   Oh, please.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.040]   No, I don't.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   Fur is murder.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.040]   Fur is murder.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.040]   This is got...
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.040]   Me that's murder.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.360]   Oh, yeah, we'll have his murder.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.760]   And I actually love stakes.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.640]   Hey, let's talk a little bit about audible.com now that we've alienated our entire audience.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.240]   Yes, go straight on the hat.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.760]   Maybe we should do an ad here.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.800]   You know, I was going to do an ad for Squarespace, but I thought that would be poor taste to
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.400]   do it right after Matt Mullen was on.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.480]   I'll save that for later.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.720]   Man, it's like a minefield.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.720]   I'll tell you.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   Audible.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.720]   Do you know about Audible?
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:27.360]   D-L-E.com, 75,000 books.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.880]   It's my audiobook source.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.080]   I am a huge Audible fan.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:38.240]   In fact, I pretty much don't get books in paper or Kindle or iPad anymore.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.000]   I use Audible because I like to listen.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.400]   And so many great stories.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   I'm reading...
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.920]   I'm sure you've read this, Gina, because it's kind of a chick book.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.920]   Eat Pray Love.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.920]   Have you read that?
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.920]   Of course I read it.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   It's a wonderful book.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   You too, Jessica.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.920]   That's expensive.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   No, it's a fantastic chick book.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   I read it.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   I'm reading it right now.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920]   Are you?
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   You're the commercial.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   You lie.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   I'm listening to it.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:56:59.920]   I missed the movie, though, but I read it.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:00.920]   The movie was pretty good.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   And actually, that's what got me to read it.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.920]   I thought, "This was good.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.920]   I want to see them."
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.920]   I want to read the book.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   The book's even better.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.920]   Audible is great.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.760]   You could hear I was on Audible.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.800]   Well, we might as well, since we have the author on the show today, we might as well plug
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   I was.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.800]   I-W-O-Z.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.800]   This is...
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.080]   I was Steve Wozniak's autobiography, "How I invented the personal computer and had fun
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   along the way."
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.080]   And somebody named Gina Smith helped him out on that.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   That was me.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   So how did that work?
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.000]   He'd like dictated it to you.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:33.800]   This was Steve and I sitting in a barbecue pit in Los Gatos twice a week.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   You're kidding.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.320]   With him eating pie and doing magic tricks for every waitress that walked by.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.320]   He loves...
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.320]   He's such a performer.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.320]   He is such a performer.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.040]   I mean, and trying to keep him on topic, and I just had a tape recorder, and I did this
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   for about six months.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.080]   And of course, he's jumping all around and just trying to get all of that in a crime
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.840]   So it was the same restaurant each time?
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.400]   Yes, it was the Hickory Pit.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.880]   Oh, I like the Hickory Pit.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:00.520]   He has kind of basic tastes and food, doesn't he?
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.520]   He likes the Hickory Pit.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520]   He likes the Hickory Pit.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   He likes the Hickory Pit.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.520]   He likes the Hickory Pit.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.520]   He would a cowboy will eat.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.520]   So I would say, "Well, would you eat sushi?"
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.520]   "Well, would you eat cowboy eat sushi?"
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.480]   No, cowboy wouldn't eat sushi.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.480]   He'd only eat what a cowboy would eat.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.480]   That's his rule.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.480]   He said if you ever want to know.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   He's a cowboy might eat sushi.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.480]   I don't want to know.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:19.080]   I just want to say, what a gargantuan effort I interviewed Steve and talked to him about.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.760]   It's hard to keep him on track, isn't it?
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:27.360]   The idea of trying to do a book with him seems like a really challenging undertaking.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:32.080]   Well, Josh, I knew I was in trouble when Steve said to me right after we signed the contract,
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:37.400]   "You know, I've tried to do this five times before and have always returned the advance."
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.400]   And I thought, my God, I've spent the advance.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   There goes the money.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.400]   I just used it for a house payment.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   That's what you do.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   You don't really have to return the advance.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.400]   Yes, well, we did.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.400]   John's an expert on that apparently.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.400]   But I never worry that Steve will do that book with another writer.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.400]   I don't think you can take money.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.800]   A little writer's tip here, it depends on your contract.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.000]   You don't have to return the advance.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.200]   Steve's voice and it's not that interesting.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.200]   What is this?
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.200]   What is this thing?
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   It's just rude.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   It's a hand.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   What is this for?
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   It's that formula.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.200]   It's for holding pens.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.200]   Why does it go like this then?
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   John's option.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   You're like that.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.200]   This is why.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:21.000]   Audible.com, a great place for your favorite audiobooks.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   I was.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   How I invented it.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Let me play a little bit of this.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   Patrick Lawler reads it.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   He sounds just like Steve.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   I was going to say.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Leo, he called me at my house and tricked me for about five minutes.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.500]   He sounds like what?
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.520]   It seems like it's was reading this book.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.520]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:39.160]   I remember sitting there and being so little and thinking, wow, what a great day.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.120]   Great world he's living in.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.040]   By the way, that's exactly how was talks.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.040]   Wow.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.040]   Wow.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:49.560]   And I just want to say I love Steve.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:53.000]   He's completely unspoiled by his.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.480]   He is like, I nobody dislikes.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   Right.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.480]   Oh, he's totally.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.560]   He's love of my little boy is the only boy in San Francisco who's called, say my uncle
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.640]   Steve invented the computer.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   That's pretty cool.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.640]   Call him uncle Steve.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   Henry's been.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640]   He's got to have at least one.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640]   Oh, he has an enemy.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   His name is Jobs.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   Oh, I don't think.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640]   Tell the story.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.640]   Tell the story.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   Tell the story.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640]   Here we go.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   Sorry.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.080]   Jobs had promised to write the foreword for the Wozniak biography.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.480]   So when the book was done, I emailed Steve Jobs and said, well, where's the foreword?
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.080]   He said, send me a couple of chapters.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.280]   I sent him a couple of chapters.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   Your mistake.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.760]   Well, I had to send him the chapters.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.960]   You could have bowed LaRise.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.280]   I should have written two fake chapters now that I know, you know, in retrospect.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   I sent him to.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.240]   He wasn't mean about jobs in there.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.240]   He wasn't mean.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   I think he was.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.240]   He told the truth.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.600]   I never forbid he told the truth.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.900]   And it was very upsetting.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.080]   And Steve Jobs called me up on the phone and said, I'm not writing the foreword for this
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   book.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.080]   I'm not doing it.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   I thought he promised to.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.400]   I said, are you going to sue me?
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.480]   He says, I'm not going to sue you, but I'm not going to.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.480]   I'm trying to get right forward.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.480]   What was in there?
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.080]   And then he banned us from the Apple stores and he banned us from Macworld.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.680]   This is when Apple was involved, us being I Woz.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680]   The book.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680]   Because he had to come in.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680]   Oh, that's just a little more.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.360]   And now I don't get invitations to.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.880]   You are also you are like me on that list.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.720]   Yes, the black list, the black list.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.480]   I bet he has a list like fine line.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.720]   It seems like between.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.800]   Be not being on it being.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   I'm like worried.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.800]   And now I see who knows.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.120]   No, no, because you're the anti gizmodo.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.920]   So you'll always be on the list.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   That's true.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   Good point.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.560]   I mean, is that my whole that's it?
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.920]   The bottom, the anti gizmodo.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.680]   That's why I'm invited to Apple.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.640]   Only only in the Apple prism.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.520]   No, because gizmodo does not and will never again be invited to anything Apple ever does
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.880]   or give get any review units or anything.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.680]   But because they still need a gadget blog, that means I mean, there's only really the
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.280]   truth is you're the king of gadget blogs anyway.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.480]   But just it's you're kind of guaranteed that position because they need somebody there
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.960]   and it's not gizmodo.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960]   Gizmodo, Sean Pepper.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.840]   These things should all be banned.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   Reviewer and writer.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.840]   Yes.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.280]   Of course you've earned your you've earned your position as the anti gizmodo.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.520]   Oh, he's throbbing.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.520]   He's throbbing is going to blow.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.520]   Love that.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.680]   You know, you do more than just we're more than just not give a no, I know.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.960]   We're not that should be the name of the blog.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.960]   We're not gizmodo.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.040]   We are changing it to not get.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040]   Yeah, not gizmodo.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.240]   I actually want to ask you about Ariana, but we'll save that for after the ad.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.200]   We are still believe it or not.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.200]   Still ever.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.840]   We are still still running out.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.080]   This is the world's longest audible ad.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.040]   Well, you know what the audible ads always get long because what happens is we start talking
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.680]   about a book and then we start talking and it goes on and on.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.760]   But I should at least wrap it up and say you can get this book free and another book.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:46.680]   You actually get two books free by signing up at audible.com/twit2.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.040]   It's the platinum account.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.720]   That's two books a month.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.080]   And it sounds maybe sounds like a lot.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   It's not.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.080]   I go through two books a month easily.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.720]   I love audible audible.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.800]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.520]   You can cancel it anytime the books will be yours to keep forever.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.840]   And you will books unlike movies and TV shows, you really do want to go back and revisit
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:05.840]   a great book.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.840]   You know what's a great book?
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.440]   It's "Indignation" by Philip Roth.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.440]   Listen to it.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440]   It's unaudible.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.560]   Philip Roth is a great writer.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.840]   Is he your inspiration?
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.520]   I love Philip Roth.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520]   He just passed away.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   Did he just pass away?
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.000]   I think he just passed away.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   So there you go.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   There's your two books.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   I was an eye-dignation.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Indignation.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   I am indignation.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   It's like being indignation.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   I'm like, okay, here we go.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   Indignation.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   You've been on the internet.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   I did nation.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   I did nation.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   That's the dappled trademark.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   There's an article.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   Try it today.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   You're going to love this.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.520]   Actually didn't Ariana, now let me ask you this.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.640]   Ariana Stasanapolis Huffington.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.640]   I love that.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.520]   Who I interviewed before she was Huffington.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.280]   So I had to learn how to say Stasanapolis.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.440]   She had just written the Picasso book, the biography of Picasso and I had her on.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.440]   She talks.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.440]   She was still lost too.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.640]   She was wonderful lady.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.080]   You can do it perfectly.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080]   Go ahead.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.080]   Ariana.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.120]   What would Ariana say to Josh?
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.480]   What would Ariana say to Josh?
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   Don't do it.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.560]   We're not going to do anything to her blog.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560]   It's okay.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.720]   Is she nominally your boss?
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.720]   It's really I do.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.320]   But they were like, it was the Boris Badenoff and his assistant.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.760]   It sounded a little like Michael Arrington.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.200]   That's why.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.240]   Now I think Ariana might gut Michael Arrington.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.240]   Yeah, I think.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240]   She might gut him.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.240]   Ariana does gut him.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.240]   Like gut him?
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.640]   Like the author of the knife and gut him?
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.640]   She ought to.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.640]   She ought to.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   She ought to.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.800]   She ought to do something about that.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:45.160]   I imagine after what Mike said about you, you wouldn't be loath to see a little knife
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.160]   battle.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.400]   I would love to see Ariana actually stab Michael Arrington.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.400]   No, he wouldn't.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.400]   No, he wouldn't.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   That's me.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.400]   Hey, I'm with him.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.200]   I had a pay per view.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.200]   I can get him a pay per view.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.200]   Like a cage match.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.200]   I watched that.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.880]   Who would win in a battle?
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.880]   Ariana.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.680]   Ariana always faces it.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.680]   Ariana.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.680]   So AOL bought Huffington Post.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.680]   They've always owned you.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.280]   No, they've known they bought you from Calcans, WebLogz Inc.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.280]   A long time ago.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.280]   A long time ago.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.280]   Pre Joshua.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.280]   Yeah, way before Mike.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.280]   Way before your time.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.280]   You were in high school when that happened.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.280]   I was a baby.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   I was actually in Swaddling.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.280]   Yeah, Swaddling.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.320]   And they also bought TechCrunch a few months ago.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.920]   So now they've got three of the biggest blog platforms out there.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.880]   But Ariana's got the one in charge.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.880]   Yes.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.880]   Is that right?
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.880]   That's what they've got.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.880]   Well, I passed.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.880]   They said, do you want to be out of their in chief of everything?
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.680]   And I said, you know, the money, the acclaim, it all sounds so good, but I'm just not going
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.680]   to take a job.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.160]   I don't think that's necessary.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.160]   No.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.160]   No.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.960]   Your content being the anti-Gizmodo.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.080]   I think that's not Gizmodo.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080]   Not Gizmodo.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.560]   I like doing the job, of course, never.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.560]   She's Ariana Huffington.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.560]   She's got the job.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.160]   No, I love covering tech news, that's for sure.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160]   No.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.160]   Yeah, who would want that job, her job?
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.160]   You know, it's weird.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.600]   His engraugent is so inventoryly.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   I love engraugent.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.760]   And engraugent is so editorially crisp and correct and not selling off his stuff.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.160]   And that's difficult for a gadget blog.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   I have to say.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160]   But you love TechCrunch.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.160]   And they're selling or we're selling.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.040]   I don't know what they're doing now under Ariana, but they were selling off editorial,
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040]   like literally selling.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.040]   It's a good idea.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040]   No, wait a minute.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.120]   Setters purchasing prizes from TechCrunch.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.880]   And this is recently?
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.320]   No, this is a special award.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.720]   By the way, don't you think any company, I want to throw this out to everybody, don't
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:41.880]   you think any company that puts on a kind of exhibition of small little companies that
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.120]   there's a conflict to interest her?
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.120]   Because if you're going to be at their show, you're going to cover them.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:51.040]   So why don't you give me $5,000 Leo and then, oh, hey, by the way, we'll give you some.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.920]   It's all totally indirect, but it's completely corrupt and it's just the way it is.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.000]   Their conference business and their blog business are separate though.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Are they not?
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.760]   I mean, I don't think that's completely.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   It goes in this.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.080]   Yeah, but you don't think the same people put money in their pockets because of it.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.680]   And it does benefit the both the blog with people at the conference and it benefits
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   the conference.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.120]   If the people are covered in the blog, I mean, it's just a conflict of interest.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.320]   I mean, they're obviously covering brand new companies and they're those same companies
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.200]   are coming to sort of pitch and show off.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.640]   But who better to do an event like that?
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.720]   I'm not saying the events better that that's their that's their beat.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.400]   So they know this stuff right now.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.400]   That's hard to win.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.200]   You pay to win defending tech crunch right now.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.200]   I know.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   I think that's very interesting.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200]   You're defending tech crunch.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.200]   This shows what an honorable man is.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.200]   Let me go ahead and I just.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.200]   I'm okay.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.200]   What depended on you one.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.200]   It's not going to change my eyes.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.360]   No, I mean, I don't I don't disagree with you, but I do think there's some separation
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.400]   of church and state there.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.880]   I mean, we have advertisers who I mean, this is maybe different.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.200]   You know, we're ad driven, right?
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.360]   We're ad supported.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   We Sony advertisers on the site.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.960]   Does that mean, you know, they're giving AOL money, which in turn is giving end gadget
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.960]   money.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.440]   We cover their products, but I mean, obviously there's no influence there.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.960]   I mean, certainly not on our staff.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.920]   By the way, I think TC 50 is free to participate in.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.160]   Johnny, disagree with it.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   I think it's free to win.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   Yes, I do.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.160]   I totally disagree.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.160]   So you're saying are we.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.560]   I just like, wait, let's just take let's go up at the couples levels and not even talking
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.560]   about you.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560]   Let's talk about NBC.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.760]   NBC is not going to be covering any news stories, slamming general electric jet engines.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.760]   That's true.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   Okay.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.760]   Or the cables.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   I'm sorry, the cable company.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.760]   Yeah, cable town, cable town.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.480]   And to John's point, when I was working at ABC at Good Morning America, reviewing what
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.960]   were then CD-ROM games, I was told, you've got to review the Disney games.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960]   Really?
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960]   Yes.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:41.960]   And I said, I can't review the Disney games.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   I can't.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.120]   Oh, it kind of happens to me whenever I'm on Regis and Kelly, and I have to play music.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   They always make me play Regis's albums.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   Is that the same?
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.120]   Not the same.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.120]   But if you had to play, she would be the same.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120]   Well, it's kind of the same.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.800]   I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.960]   I actually had to buy Regis's albums so I could put it on my iPod.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   Really?
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960]   I could use John.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.240]   So you think you think it's got to be totally independent without any ads or it's not going
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.240]   to be honest or what?
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.240]   I mean, you got to have it.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.240]   Well, that's how they do know agenda.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.240]   Yes.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.240]   Yes.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.240]   That's how they do no agenda.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.240]   No, subscriber base.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.240]   Yeah, no agenda.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.240]   Free donations, free will donations.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.760]   I would have done that, but there's no way we could have built this.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.960]   No, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're modeled the best.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960]   You're side on donations.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.200]   Yeah, we, we do just nothing but donations.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.720]   But it's not, I mean, it's not like it's, you know, a massive enterprise.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720]   It's just no agenda.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.200]   No, but it's not bad.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.880]   And the point is, is that we- How much do you make?
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.880]   I don't know.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.360]   We, you know, it's, it's, it's nothing to talk about.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   It's nothing to brag about.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.440]   But the point is, is that, you know, it's a show that we can, we can take on, we can talk
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.320]   about, you can't talk about anything anti drug companies on any network television because
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.160]   they're like, they're basically bought and sold by.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.360]   We have no, but we've got to know.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.360]   I can tell you this.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.960]   You have a Chinese wall between advertising and it's all.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   That's what everybody says.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.360]   I would say, you got zero input from our ad team on anything you do on the side.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.360]   That's all.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.360]   That's fine because we do that at PC Magazine too and we did, and market watches the same
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.360]   way nobody.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.160]   But the fact of the matter is, I, and I've said this before as a writer has been doing
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.240]   this as long as anybody in the room.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.760]   The fact of the matter is if you are working for a publication and the largest advertiser
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.520]   you have, let's say it is Sony and they're contributing maybe 50% of the income of the
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.680]   entire operation.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.360]   You're never told to ever say anything bad against Sony, but you just decide on your
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.360]   own as a writer that you're probably better off in terms of your career future, not to
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.400]   go slamming Sony because they're like keeping the company in business.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.440]   And there is no question in my mind that this happens at every publication.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.040]   Yeah, not, I mean, it doesn't happen with us.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.200]   I mean, I can tell you that we've slammed plenty of companies that pay a lot of money
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.320]   to advertise on our, on our pages.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.360]   I mean, it's just our attitude that we are.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.720]   Well, I mean, everybody, you say that to a point when a company gets really big, it,
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.320]   it turns out to be, you know, people are more circumspect.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.280]   They don't go out of their way to slam people.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.160]   I mean, it's just, well, I have to say I'm not going to slam forward, but that's one
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   of the reasons we try to get as many non tech companies as possible.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.160]   Well, yeah.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.160]   Well, that's it.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.160]   I mean, yeah, you do.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.160]   You're doing non tech.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.200]   But we do a lot of tech stuff too.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.680]   It's not for, but now for it to become any tech company.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   I know.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.480]   One of the reasons for it advertises on here is because they really could see themselves
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.480]   like a consumer electronic.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.480]   Right.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.480]   You're totally screwed.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480]   I'm screwed.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.480]   How was that?
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480]   I was doing it.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.280]   I mean, yeah, how this one thing started was I was, yeah, I was saying to Josh that I
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.080]   was amazed, frankly, that in gadget, which seems to be so editorially respected.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.440]   I think guys do have a great wall between advertising and edit.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.400]   It's to TechCrunch, which where there is no such wall that I've observed.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.840]   I mean, I'll say this.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.840]   TechCrunch does something that we don't do and that I see other sites do.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.840]   It gives does it business insider, a few other people.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.840]   And it's just something we don't do, which I've never fully understood, which is this
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.320]   sort of guest writer thing.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.880]   And the syndication and guest writer, those are ones that I have a lot of trouble with
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.880]   just on a personal level.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   What is it?
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880]   I don't know what it is.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.960]   I'm saying, you have the offender comment and each other are journalists.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   It's interesting.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.280]   It's an advertisement for me from a company come on and write sort of an editorial about
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:17.440]   why Trump's service is really how it's helped their business or certain aspects of it.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.760]   It was not clearly labeled.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   It's an advertorial.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.760]   Well, if they're getting paid or if they're doing it or yeah, there's issues, there's
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.200]   issues, there's issues, I know.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.840]   So that was my question was, you know.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.840]   But I don't know if those are, I don't know how, what this, what the how you vet, that
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.560]   the, I don't know how edited those are.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.800]   I don't know how much the people who are writing them are vetted.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.800]   I mean, they're vetted really, you know, really hard.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.360]   So it's like these guys are writing straight up from the heart and it's not something that
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360]   is.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.480]   Well, I used to do something when I was the editor at InfoWorld years and years ago.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.520]   I used to pull this trick because we never, our page count would vary so radically that
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.720]   the editors at the end of the, or the copy editors and the people in the managing editor
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.840]   would say, we need 40 more pages.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.920]   And I always had a bunch of stuff under my desk that was actually written by vendors.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.720]   And what I would do is I'd solicit a vendor like, let's say a hard discompany, my Cropilists,
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.440]   let's say, which is that they're out of business.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.440]   So I can say this.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.360]   And I'd say give, I need an article on everything you know about hard distance, where they operate
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.360]   and everything.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.640]   I want all the technology I need like a 20 page or 15 page or five pages on hard disk.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.840]   And they would write these articles, or the public relations company would and they'd
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.800]   be a bunch of promotions in there for my Cropilists.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.200]   We would have the editors, I, or I would take all the references to my crop, all of
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.560]   them without exception out of the piece and then run it.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.440]   And of course, they would, they would come in and they would complain.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.440]   I get it all.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.440]   I say they're not doing that again.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.440]   Do you know that that's the way it works.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.680]   Here's the, here's the trick for you editors.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.520]   So we'd have, I usually have a speaker phone.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.120]   I bring a bunch of people in for one of these meetings to show them how it's done.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.080]   And we, the person would come on and complain bitterly.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.280]   We wrote all this and we spent all this money to promote this thing.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.680]   And you took all the references to our company out.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.280]   And I would say, oh, you know, this is, we didn't mean to do it.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:04.040]   If you give us another piece, just do it one more time, then we'll, you know, we'll
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040]   try it.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040]   This time we'll do it right.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.640]   And like, oh, I wasn't, I didn't look at that one before.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.440]   When you just do it, you could do it over and over again.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.160]   It's like Lucy in the football.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.560]   It's like Lucy in the foot.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.560]   And it worked great.
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.080]   And it was like, don't conflict the interest of the way I saw it.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:22.360]   I can't imagine, you know, for us, I mean, we, we do a lot of training with new writers.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.960]   And even if you're like an experienced writer and you come on, we still go through this
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.480]   sort of end gadget program.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.680]   Like we have a, you know, certain ways you source things, certain ways you, you know,
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.040]   places that you look when you're trying to investigate something, ways that you describe
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040]   certain things.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:45.000]   And so I can't imagine just letting some person, anybody right for end gadget that wasn't
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.120]   trained by the editors of end gadget.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.440]   Well, we had, we had a lot of outside stuff.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.160]   And the thing, we had an unbelievable group, which they don't have in these magazines
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.720]   over any more of freelance hot, no, no, hot copy editors that were that could just turn
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.960]   everything into exactly the right style.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.960]   The right style.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.080]   I can pretty much guarantee that I remember the days, these days probably maybe with the
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.360]   exception of end gadget, don't use copy editors.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.320]   Not the, not the, yeah, not the these guys are high end copy editors.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.320]   Yeah, you can't.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.320]   What is that?
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.320]   What do they do?
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.320]   They just sex it up.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   I don't know.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.400]   No, no, they fix the commas.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.400]   They fax checked, they correct it.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.880]   They rewrite it to standard.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.480]   They rewrite, wrote it to the style of the magazine sources.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.480]   Oh, right.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.480]   Well, that's what we train.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.840]   That's the training is that we have a style, you know, we have a guide.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.400]   We've got this is, you know, there's ways of doing it, ways of not doing it.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.680]   So everybody's supposed to be trained in that way.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.280]   The idea is that's why they're all editors.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.440]   I mean, I actually believe in the idea of calling these people editors because they
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.400]   all your writers are editors.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   That's interesting.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.440]   Everybody who writes as an editor, because they can edit themselves and they can edit
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.040]   someone else and they do both of those things.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.040]   I don't know.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.040]   Every writer needs an editor.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.080]   I'm in the process of looking for freelancers and for columnists and I'm trying to find
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.080]   people who are good enough to where they don't need a ton of editing.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.320]   It's not that easy.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.880]   And it's not that easy to find quality, quality contributors.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.880]   I've always welcomed any editing that I was a good editor makes a difference.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880]   A good editor makes a great thing.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880]   You like being edited?
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.880]   I love being edited.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.760]   Well, I don't like being edited, but I tell you every time I've had good editing, I've
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.760]   welcomed it.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:20.760]   It's been an important thing.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:21.760]   I write it.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.760]   That's what it means.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.760]   You come out looking like you look better.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   You look better.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   Your byline shines.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.760]   You do kind of group editing.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.880]   When I write a reviewer an editorial, when I've got my draft, I say everybody get your
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.880]   eyes on this.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:32.880]   Take a look at this.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:33.880]   Does this make sense?
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:40.000]   I think everybody on our team, at least the input of everybody is really valuable.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.520]   It's kind of a all, it's not editing by a committee, but once I've got something or somebody
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.640]   else has something, it's nearly finished or ready to go out.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.160]   Maybe I'll take a look at it and sort of pick it apart a little bit.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.960]   I think that's pretty valuable.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.560]   The more I saw it, the better.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.160]   All right, back to the tech news.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.160]   I rap.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160]   I rap.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   It's not baseball.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160]   It's not baseball.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.160]   Well, I think people enjoy it, but I think it's time to say apple.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160]   That's news fast.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.920]   No, no, I wouldn't go that far.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.200]   I was having a little nap, but I...
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200]   He was flicking.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   He was zooming out on us.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:15.640]   Well, you notice I'm a little shorter than I was at the beginning of the show.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:21.720]   Apple is negotiating according to Bloomberg for unlimited music downloads, a new business
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.720]   for apple, and providing free backup.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.720]   Wouldn't that be amazing?
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:30.960]   They finally admitted that that's their North Carolina network facility that they've
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:36.360]   been building, that big networks operation center, is for iTunes.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.160]   Would the music industry give apple that much power?
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.320]   They've resisted it all along.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:46.840]   Another article by Bloomberg is sourced by three anonymous sources, which is the journalistic
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:47.840]   old standard, right?
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.840]   Yeah, three anonymous sources.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.840]   Three anonymous sources saying the same.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.040]   Well, they'll just have one.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.680]   Well, it could be the same guy doing different voices.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.680]   Two of the three.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.680]   I'm number two.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:03.280]   Two of the three said mid-year that an agreement may be announced.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.400]   I think though that this could be one of those things where yes, they're in talks, but it'll
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.200]   never happen because the record industries are scared to death of the power iTunes wheels.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.200]   Don't you think?
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.520]   Well, because you look at how quickly CD sales are falling and...
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.520]   Right.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520]   So they need iTunes, you think?
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.040]   They desperately need to be playing in the digital game.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.040]   You have any sources?
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.040]   They get it.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.040]   Josh, what is this?
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.040]   Do you have three unnamed sources?
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.240]   I actually have four unnamed sources.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.240]   Four.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.240]   That's great.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.680]   No, look, but here's the thing.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.160]   This is streaming is where all the stuff is headed.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.720]   Apple is late on the cloud.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.280]   They're late on streaming services.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.080]   They're late on syncing and backup and all that stuff in the cloud.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.680]   I think that it's not unrealistic at all to imagine a future where they offer a service
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.760]   like RDO or Spotify or one of those things.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.760]   Well, they bought La-La.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.760]   That's exactly what La-La did.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.760]   That's right.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.160]   Well, it also they've introduced streaming and they've put the Apple TV.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.720]   They've shown, "Hey, look, we can do streaming."
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.600]   So they're headed somewhere with this.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.880]   They're changing their mobile me service in some way from the looks of things.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.960]   So I think that it's not crazy to imagine a future where Apple's giving you a couple
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:07.960]   of options.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.320]   They're saying you can buy records.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.440]   You can get us streaming this all a car.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.840]   I mean, you have to remember when it comes to streaming, if Apple controls the pipes
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.440]   and they control the software and they control the hardware, music companies have nothing
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.440]   to fear.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.840]   I mean, really, this is Apple, right?
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.560]   They've already started making them tons of money in music.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.560]   Why not?
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.560]   They've already lost.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:26.560]   They've already lost.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.560]   Music companies have nothing to fear from Apple.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.560]   They have nothing to fear.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.560]   That's insane.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.640]   They only think they have to fear is continued profits.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:35.480]   I mean, I think the Apple is helping them make money.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.480]   That's the only way.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.480]   It's like nuclear weapons only in the hands of two companies.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.600]   You have nothing to fear because you can't help it.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.320]   I mean, this is where it's headed.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:48.240]   Before iTunes, these companies were having a real hard time to find out how they were
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.800]   going to figure out how they were going to make money in the digital world, right?
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:52.880]   And now they figured out a way.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.240]   I mean, maybe CD sales are dropping, but MP3 sales are going up or not.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.240]   That's right.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.600]   So these guys have no choice.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.520]   I mean, what are they going to do?
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.520]   What's Sony going to do?
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.520]   Start a new service?
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.800]   I mean, yes, that they already did that.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:07.800]   It didn't work.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.800]   I know.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:09.800]   Right.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   Everybody's just starting to do service.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   But the fact is that the iTunes is the largest.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.480]   Again, this is not, I'm not a fan boy.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.880]   This is facts of the largest music retailer in the world.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.440]   They're selling tons of music.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.620]   And if they decide that there is an option that's good for them and good for their bottom
[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:26.280]   line and maybe good for consumers as an aside, they'll probably go for it.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.160]   And I think it's three main stuff has definitely happened.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.360]   And I think that's where this industry has headed.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   There's no doubt that it's happening.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.960]   Hey, you can now get Netflix on the Nintendo 3DS.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:39.040]   I mean, I love this that they announced that at GDC right across the street from the Apple
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.920]   and it's at the same roughly the same time.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.520]   So my company owns GDC.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.360]   But not 3D content.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:47.000]   No, just well, because regular movies.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   Yeah, regular movies.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.680]   Although if you've seen the 3DS 3DS, I mean, I don't know.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.680]   It's not great 3DS.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.680]   Nauseating.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.680]   Whatever it's out.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:55.680]   Nauseating might be the right word.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:56.680]   Nauseating.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.680]   I hate it.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.680]   I hate it.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.680]   I hate it.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:23.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:32.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:41.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:42.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:43.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:49.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:57.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:21:59.680]   I hate it.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:00.680]   I hate it.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.680]   I hate it.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.680]   I hate it.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.680]   I hate it.
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.680]   I hate it.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:05.680]   I hate it.
