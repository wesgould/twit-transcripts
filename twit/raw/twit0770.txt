[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Tech news.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.560]   I'm going to apologize in advance to Rich D'Amuro because you're surrounded with old
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.400]   farts.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.320]   And we're just going to talk a lot about the good old days.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.280]   Rich D'Amuro is rich on tech.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.040]   He fills in for me whenever I'm not around on KFI Good News Rich.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.400]   You never have to fill in for me again.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.480]   I'm not going anywhere in the trench.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   I've seen that.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.440]   You also hear him on KFI and KTLA in Los Angeles.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   Anywhere else?
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.200]   I mean, you're everywhere now.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.680]   Yeah, a bunch of different stations, but primarily KTLA is the big one.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   Rich on tech.tv.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.960]   It's great to see you, Rich.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.400]   Rich is quarantined at home with two little boys, little two kids.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   Are they boys?
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   Two boys.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   How's that been?
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.920]   Never a dull moment.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   It's been fun.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.640]   They're actually swimming right now.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.280]   Your space looks so clean and pristine.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   I'm either either you don't let the kids in or if you just turn the camera a little bit,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   it's chaos.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280]   Oh, 100%.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.440]   When I'm not in here, the kids are literally doing YouTube videos and podcasting and every
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.680]   one of my switches is changed.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   That's a relief.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.800]   I say that because sometimes people look so good in their houses.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.360]   I think, oh my God, I'm failing at life.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.600]   So I just want everybody to understand.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   It's easy with the camera.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.680]   If you saw the wires on either side of this, you would know.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.440]   Anyway, welcome back, Rich.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.440]   Joining us also, it's great to see Larry Maggett again from CBS News Radio.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.000]   Connects safely.org.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.160]   Larrysworld.com.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.840]   I guess now, Larry, you and I, we could call ourselves senior members of the tech core.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.640]   I'm afraid so.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.720]   And by the way, if I were to pan my camera to the left or the right.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   Please don't.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.120]   No, the room is messier than ever because I actually cleaned up my background and by
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.320]   shoving everything off the side.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   Yeah, that's effective.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320]   Very effective.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   It works.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   We were talking before the show.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.160]   It's funny because now we're seeing everybody's homes and everybody's backgrounds because everybody's
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.400]   doing what we've done for years.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.720]   Including network television folks.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   I love it.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.720]   Looking at people at bookshelves.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.280]   Some of them have abnormally normal lives.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.280]   It's very depressing.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   How is that possible?
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.640]   And some of them, by the way, have satellite trucks parked in their lives.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.160]   You know who's house looks really nice Anderson Cooper.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.000]   When he was home for a little bit, it was beautiful.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.840]   And of course, you know, he's got style.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.080]   He's got Panache.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.520]   He's got Gloria Vanderbelt for a mom.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.360]   Speaking of which, we could roots there too.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.560]   Speaking of which Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who are watching us.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.200]   I also want to introduce somebody who hasn't been on Twitter in a long time.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.160]   And that's a terrible oversight.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.080]   My good friend Doc Searles, who is a legend, former editor of the Linux Journal.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.440]   He was one of the authors of the Cloutrain Manifesto.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.680]   Searles.com.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.800]   And Doc has a new job.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.560]   We're very happy to take this time to announce that Doc will be hosting our Floss show starting
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.480]   on Wednesday Floss.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.000]   Weekly, Randall Schwartz, the host that show for 13 years.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I did the math.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.640]   I started with Chris Dibona back in 2007 or 8.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.600]   Shortly thereafter, Chris got a job at Google.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   Randall came along.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.200]   Randall's been fantastic.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.400]   He's got a new gig.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.560]   He's getting very busy.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.360]   So I said, I know somebody who might be really fun to host Floss weekly and a guy who's been
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.920]   an open source advocate and supporter for a long time, Doc Searles.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.760]   Plus, and it's a real plus in this business, you're a radio guy going way back when.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.240]   It's funny.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.240]   I'll confess to being a fart, but maybe not an old one.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.600]   I don't know even though it's a chronologically.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.520]   The best kind of fart to be honest.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   You've got a real little tape actually.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   Look at that.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   Look at that.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   Look at that.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   Look at that.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   It's not a vangention.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:33.760]   Telling Leo earlier, this is how little of market there is even in 1990 for real to real.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.480]   This is the only thing left at a rental house that I moved to in San Carlos in 1990.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.880]   The completely bare house, except for this left.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.640]   Wonderful quadriphonic tape recorder.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.800]   Yeah, that was expensive.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   Quadriphonic was.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.120]   It was the Dolby surround sound of its day.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120]   Quad was.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.120]   That's...
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.320]   I have an old Ampex tape recorder in my really real and I live in a room.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.120]   I doubt if it works, I don't dare plug it in.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   It's a lovely piece of furniture.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.880]   Okay, I know we're still the answer to the intros, but this is a problem that I have
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.920]   as a tech person is the stuff that you acquire over the years.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.080]   I don't want to throw it out because I know that that old iPod is going to look cool behind
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.080]   me in 20 years.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   So I don't want to throw it away.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.080]   Right.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.480]   Don't look behind me.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.480]   I have.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.720]   I do have a little museum and when we were in the old place and had 10,000 square feet in
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.360]   the basement.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.880]   People would send me stuff.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.520]   People would just out of the blue, here's my old Amiga.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.880]   I don't know what to do with it.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   Here's a radio.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   Here's a Tandy.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   Here's a...
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.280]   I mean, and so we had a ton of stuff we just had to get rid of.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.640]   And now at this point, I don't even want this.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.800]   And John knows this.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.920]   He's running the board today.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.680]   I do a Leo's garage sale about once a year at Twit where I bring in all the poor impulse
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.000]   purchases I've made over the last year and pile them on the conference table and say,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   have at it.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.080]   It has is I won't fix it.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.320]   I don't know even what some of this stuff is.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   But you know, it's interesting.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.480]   It's always gone.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.160]   Even I did that a couple of weeks ago and it's gone almost all of it already.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.200]   So my recommendation, Rich, you're a young guy, don't start saving this stuff.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   You'll regret it.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   Let it all go.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   You'll regret it.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.320]   One thing I'll tell you, it will not be worth more money in the future.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.320]   Very unlikely anyway.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.600]   I recommend moving.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.160]   Just move, move a lot.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.360]   And then if you move a lot, you just.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   I leave stuff behind.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   Well, you evaluate.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.840]   You're looking at it as a reporter.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   Where we have done that.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:35.560]   Yeah, if you have to haul it, the equation becomes very real.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.880]   We have stuff in our house that we are still in the boxes and we moved 26 years ago that
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   we haven't unpacked yet.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.880]   So that's the problem.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.440]   That's the important stuff.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.160]   That's the important stuff you can't live with.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.680]   Anyway, Doc, welcome to the Twit Network.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680]   We're really thrilled to have you.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   I can't imagine a better person.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.400]   Thank you for real privilege to just take over the helm.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.520]   And of course, Dan Lynch and Simon Phipps, Jonathan Bennett, Aaron Newcomb, the people
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.880]   who've been helping Randall all through the show are going to continue on and help out
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   with the show.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:11.280]   I expect it will continue in its excellence under the watchful eyes of Doc Serals.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   So yeah, we're excited.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.200]   Wednesday is the first episode.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.080]   So let's see.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.840]   I keep wondering if there's going to be any tech news.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.440]   You know, each week I go, are we going to have anything to talk about?
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.400]   Thank God Elon Musk exists.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:37.120]   XAEA12 can't really be the name of the kid.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.200]   Elon Musk and Grimes have had a baby.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.880]   They had a son on Monday.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:49.800]   They, Elon tweeted out that strange name.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.480]   Joe Rogan asked him on Thursday, how do you say the name?
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.280]   Musk says the name's pretty much pronounced X, A12, A.E.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.160]   Some speculated was actually ash.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.600]   It's a, a, a, a, a, a, some languages have it.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.080]   It's often pronounced ash.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.720]   He's, Musk said, first of all, Grimes is the one that came up, mostly came up with the
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.120]   name is just X, the letter X.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.040]   Grimes in her tweet said it's the unknown XAE is pronounced ash.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.440]   So obviously the kid's name is ash, right?
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.320]   You're going to just the rest of it is extra.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.120]   And then A12, Elon said is my contribution.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.400]   The A12 stands for the Archangel 12, the precursor to the SR-71, the blackbird, which
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.040]   was the phantom spy plane, right?
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.680]   The coolest plane ever, Elon said.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:50.240]   If you want to hear Musk say it, he says 37 seconds into Joe's show.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.560]   Elon did not talk up on the show, though, I think, right?
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.560]   Not this time.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.960]   Holy cow.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   Learn his lesson.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.720]   Learn his lesson.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   God.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.160]   Anyway, thank you, Elon, for giving us something to talk about.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   That's Twitch for the week.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.160]   Thank you, everybody.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   No.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.800]   I'm sometimes tempted.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.600]   Actually, Elon's in a battle with the county of Alameda.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.880]   He's actually pursuing them.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:20.320]   He has been very vocal about COVID-19 being, I don't know if he thinks it's a hoax.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:27.080]   It doesn't quite go that far, but he really wants his factory, a Tesla factory in Fremont
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.160]   to be open.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.240]   The county shut it down.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.920]   He kept it open after the shelter in place orders.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.440]   The county said, "No, you're not essential."
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   Shut it down.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.560]   He now seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against the county.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:46.880]   He wants to bring back about 30% of the workers to get them working on cars.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.280]   I doubt Elon's selling a lot of cars, but he does need to get production up for a variety
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.040]   of reasons, including the fact that he gets a bonus if he can get production up.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.200]   I've been in the factory, and there are a lot of robots in that factory.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.040]   In fact, I was there during full production, and there were relatively few people in the
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.920]   factory compared to a traditional auto factory.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.480]   As much as I fully believe in waiting as long as necessary to make sure our health has come
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.040]   through for our economy, I actually wonder whether he could open it and still maintain
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.800]   a lot of distance because of the robots.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.760]   It's funny you had that reaction because I expected more robots when I toured the factory.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.560]   When I went down to pick up my monolax, I toured the factory.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.480]   They have giant German robots that do very strange things.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:42.240]   For instance, at one point, two of them pick up the half-assembled car and flip it over
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:49.120]   and raise it up to put it on a second raised assembly line so the workers can work underneath
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.960]   the chassis.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.520]   Honestly, there's still people doing most of the equipment.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.840]   No, for instance, the Lexus plant, which is almost entirely robotic, there are cars that
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.360]   are made entirely robotically, but there are still a lot of assembly line workers.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.000]   That's a dangerous job, especially.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.440]   By the way, he's also 10,000 people work in that factory.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.760]   He also is threatening, he said he's going to move his headquarters out of Palo Alto,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.760]   out of California.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:22.160]   So the mayor of Palo Alto is now doing whatever he can to convince Elon to stay in Palo Alto.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.880]   People should just say, "Fine, Elon, go."
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.160]   He wants to go to Nevada, whereas Gigafactory is, or Texas.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160]   But you have to wonder.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.200]   He's also selling all of his houses this week.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.520]   This guy, he had more news in one week than some people have in a year.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:45.720]   The Wall Street Journal published an article, "Elon Musk, text, cash, poor billionaire."
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   Aww.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.600]   Poor guy.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   Aww.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.080]   Is that what it is?
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.440]   He wants a lot of money.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:02.000]   So let me explain why he needs the $75 million, which is what he's asking for his three California
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.880]   mansions.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:13.200]   He needs the cash so he can buy his stock options so he can maintain his equity stake,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.760]   20%, $28 billion worth.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.320]   Is that why he said it was too high?
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.800]   Because he wants to buy it at a lot.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   Yes.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.480]   Look, at first it all seems crazy.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.440]   And then he doesn't take any salaries.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.480]   His compensation entitles him, according to the Wall Street Journal, to stock awards
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:38.720]   worth more than $50 billion if the company passes certain milestones by 2028.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:46.880]   He became eligible at the end of April for the first tranche of these stock options because
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.480]   Tesla's market value had stayed above $100 billion for a specified amount of time.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.320]   But he needs $592 million to exercise so that he can get that billion dollars worth of
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   stock.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.280]   So he's not that poor.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.200]   I go through that same calculus.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.840]   I know how he feels, right?
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.560]   500 billion here, 500 million there.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.560]   It's tough.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.080]   He did say when the Wall Street Journal asked, "Oh, I'm trying to make my life as simple
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.760]   as possible right now.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.880]   So it'll only keep things that have sentimental value.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.880]   It's not that I need the money."
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.200]   That's why you need three houses.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   It's simple.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   Hold it down.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.120]   I bet he doesn't keep his old iPods.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.560]   No, I bet you're right.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.320]   He even put his old car into space.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.520]   I mean, talk about getting rid of something.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.520]   That's a good way to get rid of something.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.480]   I bet it was a tax write off.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.120]   I remember when I interviewed him many, many years ago, and this was before the new model
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.880]   X or whatever, and I asked him, I said, "What car do you drive?"
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.360]   Because I was curious, you know, because he couldn't drive a Tesla at the time.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.680]   And I think it's the same, well, now I'm sure he's driving a Tesla, but it was like an Audi.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.120]   It was like one of those Audi SUV's I think it was.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120]   It's hard.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.960]   I know when you can't drive your Tesla, you got to drive your Audi.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   What are you going to do?
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   That's nice, right?
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   You still have a model X, right, Larry?
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.120]   I have the model three.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   Three?
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   Oh, that's right.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.120]   You love the three.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.760]   And I actually got the new hardware chip put in the last just before the lockdown.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.660]   And so I can take advantage of this new software, which stops automatically at stop signs, red
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.660]   lights.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.660]   And if you have a bonus, it stops at green lights.
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.600]   Who do you want it to or not?
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   So you used it.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.960]   Oh, I'm not driving a lot, but I have had a few errands that I've done.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.320]   So you say it stops at any light?
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.560]   It stops at any light regardless of its color.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.560]   That's so good.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.560]   Oh, wow.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.560]   That's so useful.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.600]   You can hit the accelerator or flip the little thing and it'll go through it if you do that.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.520]   But I think it's great for stop signs, but for lights...
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.720]   It does recognize stop signs.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.700]   Yeah, and it doesn't know right from the light.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.700]   Oh, but it's over?
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   It does.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.700]   It shows you on the screen.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.060]   It actually shows a picture of the traffic light.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.860]   And so far, I've never noticed it getting it wrong.
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.180]   So it knows to color the light.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.060]   My guess is it doesn't want to take a chance of running a red light by running a green
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.060]   light.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.500]   So it's probably being very conservative right now.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.980]   Look, you know, as you know, what I've done is I've paid more than $60,000 for the privilege
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.140]   of being part of the beta test team.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.140]   Yeah, beta subject.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.700]   I mean, that's exactly what I'm doing.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.700]   It's Lisa always...
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.700]   But now how many...
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.700]   My Tesla, a beta.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.700]   She's a beta vehicle.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.700]   Absolutely.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.480]   How many years have you had this car and you were able to put this new chip in it to upgrade
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.480]   it?
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   How many years have you had it?
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.240]   I got it the end of 2018, so a little more than a year.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.800]   And I got the chip, I guess in March, right before the lockdown, I was like the last guy
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.360]   to get his chip installed before the lockdown.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.200]   You know, and again, I've only driven a couple of 30 miles since I've gotten it in because
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   I'm not going anywhere.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.600]   Would you...
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.880]   I mean, every time I used autopilot, and I didn't have that, but I had the basic autopilot,
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.000]   I would pretty much be constantly on the...
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Absolutely.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.140]   Very vigilant because even if you disengage it, you got to know what's going on.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.140]   So you got to kind of pay attention.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.500]   And we've heard plenty of stories of cars plowing into guardrails and doing dumb things.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.740]   Now it's even more dangerous because of city street driving.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.180]   I actually think I'm as vigilant as when I drive a regular car and you have to be.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.880]   Really do because, you know, at the end of the day, it's good about 99% of the time,
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.360]   but there are several cases where I would have had an accident and had I not...
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.920]   1% will kill you.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920]   Exactly.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920]   It's kind of like COVID, right?
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.920]   No, it's just you.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.020]   It doesn't have to be a big percentage to be scary.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:35.500]   I want to report that I have a 2005 Subaru Outback that has not moved in months and is
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.500]   covered in guano.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.500]   How's the automobile?
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.500]   There's no technology at all.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   It doesn't need any.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.500]   But it does not get out of the stock side.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.500]   It's a pay for it and that's what it does.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.460]   But the thing about your car is that the wheel was invented in America.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.740]   So you do have American technology, according to the president.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.180]   Wait a minute, the wheel was invented in America?
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.660]   Didn't Trump once say that Americans and an American invented the wheel?
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.860]   I could have sworn he said that.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.340]   Oh, and I mean, I completely believeable.
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.340]   It's a politically believable.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.380]   Incredible statement.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:11.300]   And as one congressman said, if English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it ought to
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.340]   be good enough for people.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:20.540]   Hey, it's a George Bush saying the French don't have a word for entrepreneur.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   Okay.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:26.820]   You know, this could be an entire show.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.940]   The things that president.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.140]   Politicians, malapropisms.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.260]   All right.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.260]   So there we go.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:40.460]   I think we've got it all done.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.660]   The thing I do like about you, Lon, is he doesn't make any bones about, you know, look,
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.180]   I want to get the factory started up.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.420]   So screw COVID.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:55.980]   But then there's people like Jeff Bezos running Amazon who seems to care about his workers.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.700]   And yet I don't know.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.700]   Are you guys?
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.700]   Let me ask you.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.700]   Well, are you so let's ask Rich.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.340]   Are you shopping at Amazon these days?
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.580]   I am actually.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:11.380]   So I, it's funny because, you know, with Amazon, it's like the complete failure of the system
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.060]   when this whole COVID thing first started, you couldn't get anything.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.380]   You know, you look on the ordering and it'd be four weeks out.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.340]   So everyone kind of started looking for other places.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.940]   I did the whole Best Buy thing where I picked up something at the store, you know, the drive
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.620]   through thing.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.820]   But Amazon, I mean, it's, it does raise the question of, you know, is Amazon an essential
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.100]   business, which a lot of people order stuff there.
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.020]   But why are they any different than what Elon wants to do with his factory?
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:42.100]   I mean, it's not like he is going to run a factory and put people at risk.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.060]   You know, and it's a tough thing.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.700]   I'm not saying I have the answer to it, but I would think that if anyone, Elon is a very
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.500]   smart guy.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.900]   And so is Jeff Bezos.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.900]   And so is, well, so is Bezos.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.940]   I mean, I'm just saying it's like they're both, they both have the same.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.860]   But they're also advanced capitalists.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.500]   Well, agreed.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.100]   How is Amazon any less essential than Walmart, which is open?
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.100]   And that's the other thing.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.620]   So it seems to me it's even more dangerous for me as a regular person to go into any
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.100]   store that I can around a 20 block radius of my house.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.420]   You know, the Walmarts of the world, the targets, the best, you know, not Best Buy, but, you
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.220]   know, the Rouse Costco.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:24.660]   So I mean, there's no control there versus a factory where they're going to take your
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.660]   temperature.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.060]   They're going to make sure that you're not sick.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.700]   They're going to have rapid testing.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:34.620]   So in your risk or Amazon, it's very close to zero as long as the package is infected,
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.620]   which is key.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.620]   Well, yeah, I'm not considering my risk.
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.420]   I'm just considering should we, but you're right.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.100]   Anything else we choose to use instead of Amazon is going to have exactly those same
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.100]   risks.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.780]   I'm a little thoughtful as to what I order.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.780]   I try not to order things that I don't need.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.900]   I mean, which would make sense in general anyway, but I'm a little less of a shopper than
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.780]   I normally am, but I've bought many essentials on Amazon, including some sweatpants, which
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.180]   is essentially all I wear these days.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.260]   But, you know, I try to keep the...
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:08.700]   I think there should be a government program to drop off sweatpants at every home.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.940]   You know, five or six.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.700]   That way we'd all have plenty of sweatpants.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   There'd be no crisis.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.140]   It just comes with the check.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.220]   The stimulus check on sweatpants.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.220]   Here are your sweatpants.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:24.380]   The reason I bring this up, Tim Bray is a guy I've known for a long time who's a...
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.740]   I've forgotten he went to Amazon, but he's pretty much worked in technology.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.740]   Everywhere.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:36.540]   Recently resigned about a week ago as VP and distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.180]   He'd been working there for five years.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.580]   He says in his blog post by Amazon, "I quit and dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.900]   who are making noise about warehouse employees frightened of COVID.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.820]   What with big tech salaries and sharevestings?
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.500]   This will cost me over a million dollars pre-text dollars, not to mention the best job I've
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.060]   ever had working with awfully good people.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.900]   So I'm pretty blue.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.380]   He felt like he couldn't keep working at Amazon.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:11.620]   After Amazon fired people who tried to organize, smeared people who tried to organize.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.940]   He said, "I just don't think that's right and I don't want to be working in a company
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.700]   that does it."
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.260]   I feel guilty because yes, I shop at Amazon too.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.060]   Rich, you've given me a wonderful justification.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.060]   Oh, they're all screwed up.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.420]   So just go anywhere you will.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.780]   Well, I mean, and a lot of people make their livelihood working at Amazon.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.780]   That's right.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.780]   You have 150,000.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.300]   They added 150,000 jobs.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.780]   Right.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.780]   I agree.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.940]   It goes kind of back to what you said at the beginning.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.220]   Like some people, I mean, this has been devastating to so many people, but I mean, a lot of people,
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.540]   if they do want to get out there and work, Amazon has given them that option.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.660]   There's a lot of these warehouses and stuff.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.660]   I'm sure there's some people that don't want to be working, but they sort of have to be
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.180]   or you need to be.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.900]   But it's a tough situation.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.940]   To me, I don't see it as any different than you're running these factories, you're running
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.460]   a warehouse, you're running a supermarket.
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.620]   There is no safe place.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:11.220]   There's nothing that's any safer than anywhere else right now except in your home.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.220]   Right.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.820]   I guess the question is what is essential and what isn't.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.180]   I think we'd all agree that food is ice cream essential.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.060]   If I have Safeway Deliver Ice Cream, is that an essential item that I'm entitled to have
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.700]   a worker take a risk and putting it in a package for me or the only vegetable defense?
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.860]   Well, what if I ordered pizza delivery?
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.860]   What if I ordered pizza delivery?
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.860]   I mean, pizza with my other screen.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.860]   Well, I ordered pizza because I figure I'm keeping that pizzeria alive.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.780]   I'm keeping the people who work their life.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.020]   The delivery person, yes, he's risking his life, perhaps.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.940]   I mean, I don't know how risky it is to drive a delivery car, but especially with food.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:53.100]   What if that delivery guy has COVID and he's ringing 50 doorbells a night and dropping off
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.100]   the pizza?
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.100]   I mean, it never ends.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.700]   This was a whole conversation.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.020]   There is no perfect safety.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.020]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.020]   No.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.660]   So we all have to make that decision.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.460]   And the problem is we're going to involve other people in that decision, right?
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.460]   Because if I ordered pizza, then not only am I potentially risking myself, I feel like
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.260]   that's a relatively safe thing to do.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.860]   But maybe I'm risking the people making the pizza, the people delivering the pizza.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.180]   We all have to make that decision.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.820]   There is no perfect decision, though.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.340]   But A, we have to eat.
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.340]   You have to eat.
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.500]   And although my wife is growing a vegetable garden and she's increased, and I've always
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.900]   kind of been a little whole, how about a vegetable that I actually really been encouraging her.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.900]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.900]   Because we know those are safe.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.340]   But the bottom line is that you've got to eat, whether it's pizza or whatever you order
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.420]   from the supermarket, and people are making a living, but I do agree that they should
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.740]   have the utmost support from their employers.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.420]   And I don't mind paying more money during this period.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.180]   And in fact, we do typically if you get things delivered, you're paying a premium.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:59.100]   But I want them to have PPE and at least six to eight feet apart from fellow workers and
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.300]   all the normal things that they need to be safe.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.300]   Well, how about this?
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.900]   Are you going to give up pork?
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.860]   Oh, because of what's going on?
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.860]   It's a...
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.860]   You're safe.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:15.820]   We're learning that our meat factories are very dangerous places to be.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:21.380]   The problem is in the modern world, we are so interdependent and we very rarely know
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.380]   the process.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.540]   Somebody in the chat room says, "Yeah, there's a hundred...
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.540]   You buy a pencil.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.900]   There's a hundred technologies involved in the manufacture and deliver it to that pencil."
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.500]   And we don't know.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.500]   We don't know.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.740]   We're all dependent on one another in ways that we don't even see.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.500]   It's very difficult to do the right thing.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:45.740]   But it also makes you wonder what's happening outside of COVID with these meatpacking plants.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.260]   I mean, it's like these may not be very sanitary places anyway.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.260]   Good point.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.300]   I mean, it makes you just wonder about the whole damn thing.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.060]   I don't want to bring everybody down.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.060]   I just...
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.060]   It's an interesting...
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.060]   Happy Mother's Day by the way.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.060]   Happy Mother's Day.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.060]   Don't give a mother pork.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.060]   Just those flowers.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.860]   That's not even getting into flowers.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.860]   Oh my gosh.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.860]   Oh my gosh.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.860]   No cut flowers.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:09.860]   Mmm.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.860]   All right.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.580]   Let's take a break.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.300]   We need a reset after all that.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.300]   Doc Serals is here.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.660]   I'm happy to say the new host on Floss Weekly Serals.com.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:25.300]   It's great to see you in your quadriphonic of Akai tape recorder.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.860]   You don't use that, do you?
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.220]   I have a couple of times.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.060]   It's too hard to hook up.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:39.660]   I need to hook it up to an old computer that will take in audio through an analog jack.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.140]   And not many of them do that anywhere.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.140]   Oh yeah, because it's probably...
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.140]   I was supposed to be some other hacks.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.140]   It's quadrific.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.300]   Oh, you can get an idea of that.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.380]   I mean, I never recorded anything in quad, but all my old real-to-real tapes are mono,
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.380]   actually.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.020]   They're that old.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.580]   You can get a USB adapter.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.860]   I have a sound question that you think for years.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.860]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.860]   Take in audio.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.860]   I think I have one that I bought at Amazon.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.860]   How did I go?
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.220]   This mic actually hooked up to an analog board.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.220]   It's hooked up to an old analog board.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.500]   And then that's hooked up to a USB adapter because I actually get better sound than I
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.060]   give a digital board for some reason.
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.140]   I don't know why, but still I think it sounds better.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.140]   I've had that happen.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.140]   I had a bear-incher board.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.140]   It's not here.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.140]   It's a bear-incher.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.140]   That's right.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.140]   Bear-incher.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.140]   Yeah, they're good.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.140]   They're good.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.140]   Aren't you glad you're young, Rich?
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.540]   No old technology.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.940]   This is you, Rich.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.020]   You're seeing yourself in about 20 years.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.020]   Just get ready.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.020]   This is your life coming up, coming strong.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.020]   All right.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.020]   All right.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.140]   Show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.900]   One thing I know if you're working at home, you need to protect yourself, protect your
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:49.380]   security, protect your privacy, and do it with the software I use.
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.020]   I looked into this.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.060]   There's a lot of VPNs out there.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:58.540]   One thing we know about inexpensive or free VPNs is the only way they monetize is by
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.260]   using you as the product.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.620]   That's not what you got a VPN for.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:07.100]   You got a VPN, so you wouldn't have to worry about snoops.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.820]   When you're home without your IT department overlooking you and taking care of you, you
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.540]   got to protect yourself against online threats.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.620]   You got to protect your privacy.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.900]   I think ExpressVPN is a great choice for a couple of reasons.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.220]   First of all, I love ExpressVPN because they're fast.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.860]   I think you all know a VPN protects you by encrypting the content, by emerging into
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.620]   the public internet via a VPN server somewhere out there.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.220]   I think a lot of us think, and I did for a long time, I can't use a VPN because it's
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.540]   going to slow me down too much.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.740]   First of all, they're in almost 100 countries.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:45.980]   There's a server near you, and that server is fast enough to deliver HT content without
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.980]   buffering.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:51.260]   Several times, I've accidentally left a VPN on and not even noticed.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.140]   It's that fast.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.300]   You won't pay a penalty using ExpressVPN.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.620]   Your data will be encrypted.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.460]   You won't have to worry about people seeing what you're doing, whether it's a bad guy
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.180]   or you're an internet service provider snooping on your traffic.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.580]   I'll tell you, even in Cognito mode, your ISP sees everywhere you go on the internet
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.740]   unless you're using ExpressVPN.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.340]   Now, it's very important that you use a VPN provider that also respects your privacy.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.500]   That's ExpressVPN.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.460]   It's not just me who says that.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.780]   They have been audited by third parties, independent third parties.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.940]   They have a server technology.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:27.940]   They went the extra mile.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.100]   They created something called Trusted Server.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:35.980]   When you use ExpressVPN, you click that single button on your phone or your laptop that connects
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.740]   you to the VPN.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.100]   It spins up something called a Trusted Server that runs only in RAM.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.020]   You're going through that.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.340]   That Trusted Server is sandboxed.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.620]   It can't write to the hard drive.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.860]   It cannot write to the hard drive.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.660]   The minute you log off, that server disappears.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.100]   Every bit, every trace, everything you did disappears as well.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.980]   There is no record of your visit.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.700]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.380]   That's the Trusted Server technology.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.340]   As I said, it's been audited.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.140]   ExpressVPN has no logging.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.540]   They know nothing about you and that's what you want.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.620]   You want your privacy.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.620]   You want security.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.980]   There's some nice features too.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.900]   You can emerge in any one of 94 countries.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.260]   That means you can watch Netflix in those countries.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.460]   If you're in the mood for some Doctor Who, you've watched all the Netflix at home.
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.300]   Just fire up Netflix, press the button on ExpressVPN to go to London.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.740]   Suddenly, you can see all those Doctor Who episodes as part of your Netflix subscription.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.020]   That's pretty nice too.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.620]   With HD speed, no buffering.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.620]   It comes in.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.180]   It's just like you're there.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.380]   My only question is why aren't you using ExpressVPN?
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.780]   At home, on the road, at work, it's the best way to secure your connection.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.100]   Right now, you get an extra three months free of ExpressVPN.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:47.340]   I'm going to one year package when you go to expressvpn.com/twit.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.140]   We thank ExpressVPN for their support.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:58.980]   We thank you for supporting us by using that address expressvpn.com/twit.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.020]   Rich tomorrow, Doc Serals, the great Larry Maggots.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.380]   Great to have you all on.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.140]   The show, let's see.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.340]   There's an interesting surprising story.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.700]   Remember there was a bit of a controversy.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.380]   I don't know if you've been following this.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:21.420]   In Toronto, there's a part of the Toronto Lakeside that is not developed.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.140]   It's just basically a warehouse district.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:30.060]   The city was partnering with Sidewalk Labs, which is an alphabet company, one of the Google
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.380]   properties.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.780]   To create a smart city, they were going to build a whole new development there.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:39.860]   The data was going to be collected about traffic, about people moving around.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.020]   It was going to be a high-tech city within a city.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.780]   They got a lot of nimby criticism.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.420]   And now, as of this week, they're walking away from it.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.740]   It was going to be a billion-dollar project that had been underdeveloped for over two
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.180]   years.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.860]   Local residents didn't like the idea.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.460]   And so they tweeted Sidewalk Toronto with great sadness and disappointment.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.940]   This was yesterday, no, two days ago.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:11.220]   We announced Sidewalk Labs will no longer pursue the Keyside project in Toronto.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:19.180]   This has always been my fear is that people who are strong privacy advocates might also
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.940]   impact the rest of us who say, "I don't care.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.620]   I want a safe, secure, data-driven city."
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.260]   Yeah, but if nobody else, people don't like it, well, we're not going to do it.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.860]   Is this a loss to Toronto or is this a good thing?
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.260]   Without taking the side, I think it's a good thing.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.260]   I'll get Larry first, then you, Doc.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.820]   It might be the whole Amazon thing in New York, right?
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.860]   I mean, there were people who were dead set against Amazon coming in, but there were
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.620]   a lot of people who were very upset that Amazon didn't come in with all the jobs.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.140]   So you're going to have both people on both sides of any of these issues.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.540]   Doc, you said it's a good thing.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:59.620]   Yeah, it's a good thing for a reason, quite aside from the privacy risk one, which is the
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.700]   one that most people bring up, or just becoming too dependent on a single company.
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.380]   It's that Google's history here is not great.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:11.540]   What they did with Google Fiber is kind of, I mean, it's still operating in Kansas City
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:17.140]   and a couple other places, but they came in with great promise, and it didn't work out
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.340]   the way they wanted to.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.900]   And go look them up online, Google Graveyard.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.900]   There's a zillion things that may have stopped.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.260]   They do not have a great record here.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.220]   I think that they're, I think when stuff is close to home for them, or if they're buying
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:35.340]   an already successful operation like they did famously with YouTube or something like
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.700]   that, they're fine.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:41.500]   But in trying to get a new thing like that going, I think it's way too abstract in the
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.780]   way they approach it.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:49.900]   You know, I mean, with Google Fiber, for example, I have a friend who's in the fiber
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.300]   business and he said, you know, what do you need if you're going to do fiber?
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.860]   You know, he said, you need two things.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.300]   You need customer support and you need a crew.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.900]   And Google like jobbed it out, I don't know, to who to to to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.380]   fence contracts and stuff.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.500]   I mean, so, but then it failed more or less.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.180]   And, and, you know, so I just, I feel better for Toronto.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.500]   Let's, let's look at who Google was up against with the fiber.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:19.980]   And you're talking AT&T Comcast, all these companies that owned the right of ways and
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.580]   what Google did.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.580]   And I agree with you, Doc.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.740]   I totally agree that Google, they're, they're track record of starting a project and just
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.260]   giving up on it is, is unsurpassed.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.340]   Nobody else is like that except them.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.980]   But with fiber, I think I don't know if fiber is the best example because you're up against
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.140]   the biggest telecoms in the world.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.020]   And Google has always tried to, you know, with unlocked phones.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.420]   Remember when the pixel was unlocked?
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.060]   They tried to do it or sorry, before the pixel the Nexus, they tried to do unlocked
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.420]   phones and nobody would sell them.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.420]   Then they had to go to AT&T to be the carrier.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.420]   It's little things like that.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.900]   Now they have to do Verizon with the Pixel.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.460]   So I don't know if fiber is the best example with this because I remember doing a story
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:05.740]   where we flew to Austin, Texas and AT&T wanted to install fiber.
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.020]   And it's a whole big thing.
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.500]   These companies, they fight tooth and nail to basically make it impossible for you to
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.700]   lay any sort of new lines.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.660]   And that's why you look at all these companies have given up.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:21.540]   You go to a house, you have exactly one choice for your high speed internet that's wired.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.060]   And now all these new companies are looking towards wireless.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:29.700]   But anyway, as an observer, I totally want the smart city because you don't have to live
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.620]   there if you're worried about privacy.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.940]   It's the same thing as going into a mall, except it's more of a public area.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.540]   I mean, the mall you go in, they're tracking you on Bluetooth and all that kind of stuff.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.540]   And this would have been really cool.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.780]   It's like a Disneyland, but in real life.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.860]   And I think it would have attracted tourism.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.340]   I think it would have been a fun place to check out to see how a city that's totally planned
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.780]   operates.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:53.300]   And yeah, Google could have given up on it, but I don't know if that's the reason why
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.820]   it's a bad idea.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.820]   The sidewalk lab.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.900]   Let me just describe this because you can see if this is something you'd like.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:06.340]   Sidewalks Labs plan was to spend $1.3 billion on mass timber housing have been made a wood
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:12.020]   heated and illuminated sidewalks, public Wi-Fi, and of course, a host of cameras and other
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.620]   sensors to monitor traffic and street life.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:20.140]   In theory, the monitoring would be to improve the quality of life in sidewalk.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.620]   You make a great point though, Doc.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.580]   It would be really sad if they built this and then after a couple of years ago, yeah.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.380]   And then who's going to run it?
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.180]   So another reason is, okay, let's say you're a city.
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:35.580]   Do you need to hire a giant company who's actually not in that business to make your
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.380]   city, make a big part of your city?
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.380]   Well, this is what Sidewalks do.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.380]   So Sidewalks do companies.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.140]   A lot of new startups.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.980]   Sidewalks is a startup within Alphabet.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.420]   Sidewalks was a startup within Alphabet to design Smart City.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.580]   So it wasn't out of their ballpark.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.220]   It's not Google's business.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.460]   It was an Alphabet business.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.020]   But it was, I mean, this was what they were designed to do.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.620]   So Rich, you're going to have to move to Japan to Toyota City because they, I think, are
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:04.700]   still going ahead and building their Smart City right near Mount Fuji.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.700]   Okay.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.900]   I mean, when I go to these shows in Asia back in the day, like I said, when we travel,
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.140]   you always see this idea of the Smart City.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.180]   And it reminds me of that.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.380]   Do you guys remember that project in Florida?
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.380]   It was like celebration or something like that?
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.380]   The city, the planned Disney.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.940]   Which they abandoned, by the way.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.780]   So I mean, I don't know.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:32.020]   I feel like it'd be kind of fun to see someone plan something that in America, or in this
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.620]   case, Canada, just to see.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.580]   I mean, why not think outside the box?
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.580]   You look at these big cities in America and they're not the best quality of life for
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.580]   people.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.580]   And it would be interesting to see how technology could make life better.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:50.100]   Maybe the roads adjust when traffic is high or lower, whatever.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.220]   I mean, I think it's kind of cool.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.220]   I am.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.300]   I'd almost rather have Google do it than Disney.
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.260]   Disney scares me a little bit.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.260]   Everything would be Disney.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.060]   You'd have to have like the Mickey Mouse ears on everything.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.060]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.300]   There'd be speakers in the ground playing.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:10.980]   It's a small world till you went crazy.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.340]   It's an interesting, maybe because we're technologists or I'm a technologist.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:20.060]   I like the idea that technologists and technology in general could bring to a city if you're
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:26.620]   started from scratch and planned it, could rationalize it and make a city work better
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.420]   for its residents.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:33.020]   So I feel like it's a shame that we didn't at least get an opportunity to try that.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.740]   Maybe Toyota City will be a better example.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.620]   The best cities in the world are the oldest cities.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.380]   I mean, Paris is a wonderful city.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.940]   London is a wonderful city.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.340]   New York is a wonderful city.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:48.260]   And somehow they managed to evolve in ways from literally course in buggy days, if not
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.860]   earlier, to a modern city.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.340]   But they're far from Turkey.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.500]   They're trying to find your way around Boston.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.500]   Right?
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:00.140]   You're not supposed to know about the Boston or San Francisco or New York.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.140]   But I think you're right.
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.660]   Maybe after a thousand years of city, the rough edges get worn off and there's enough
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.020]   culture and time gone by that.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.340]   I mean, I'll agree with you, Paris is one of the best cities in the world.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.300]   So maybe that's the other way to do it is let them evolve over time.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.100]   I just wonder if you could plan something and make it extra.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.900]   To some degree, Paris is planned.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.860]   And to some degree, it grew out of a fire.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:32.700]   You know, Jeffrey West has some brilliant stuff on this about how cities.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.780]   He had a great Ted talk on this and why companies die in cities live.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.300]   And companies tend to be closed systems and cities tend to be open systems.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.500]   And the bigger they get, the more diverse they get.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.980]   I mean, look at Los Angeles.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.420]   I mean, it's the most of possibly the most diverse city in the world.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.540]   Has the largest expatriate population from like 44 countries.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.820]   And that's part of the charm of it.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.500]   But then again, it was stupid to kill off the trolleys, which they did, you know, a
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.100]   long time ago and it made a movie about it.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.100]   So no, you're right.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.580]   Paris was, I forgot that in the empire.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.580]   The Baron husband.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.580]   The Baron husband completely.
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.900]   But you know, the other thing, if it Paris is owned by Parisians, it's not owned by a
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.420]   single company.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.220]   And it does scare me a little bit if you think about a company town.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.820]   And I don't know whether, I don't know what plans were in place in Toronto to prevent
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.420]   this from literally becoming a company town.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.340]   But that would frighten me that one company had an enormous amount of influence.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.340]   Right.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:31.420]   Was this all of Toronto or is it just a little tiny area of Toronto on the water.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   And right.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.620]   And it was a wasted area right now just a warehouse district.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.980]   It's not it's kind of like reminds me of in Santa Monica.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.620]   They've got this, you know, Third Street promenade that's great.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.660]   He's now kind of is well, now it's kind of dying off because you know, malls and stuff.
[00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:49.740]   But the reality is like it was an area that they kind of revitalized and made it into
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.580]   this cool hip kind of place where people congregated.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.820]   And we've seen that before with malls historically now the outdoor malls are kind of taking,
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.540]   you know, if you look at Los Angeles, like the most popular outdoor malls or the Grove
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:06.020]   and the Americana and every other city in America now is trying to replicate those sort
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.620]   of outdoor malls, which maybe that plan is.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.100]   But at this point, indoor malls are dying.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.740]   In fact, this is going to be the death now of indoor malls completely.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.740]   Absolutely.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.300]   But it makes it all better.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   Fresh air.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.620]   Yeah, just it kind of blends in the it blends in the world around the neighborhood.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:27.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.180]   And the Santana row would be an example in San Jose.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.180]   Yes.
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.180]   I would bet the key side.
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.180]   Shopping.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.420]   That reminds me of Abbakini in Venice Beach, which is kind of a slum almost.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:51.340]   And it had been completely abandoned as now like, you know, extraordinarily expensive
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.340]   and vital.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:57.100]   At the same time, here in Santa Barbara, the main street got too expensive called State
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:02.940]   Street and an area that was very much like Abbakini was kind of, and like Keyside.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:07.180]   It was industrial, it was a lot of big old factory kind of places.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.260]   That's now called the Funk Zone.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.940]   And it was by far the hottest part of town.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:11.940]   And it's thriving.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:19.380]   Well, it happens naturally because it's tough as cheap.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.500]   This is the, I mean, literally this is the area.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.340]   Here is sidewalk Toronto.ca.
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.060]   I mean, it's not a big area.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:32.820]   And I think a lot of the local objections were just, oh, we don't want Google spying.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.380]   But this wasn't people where we're going to live there.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.500]   It was just, it was, oh, we don't like Google.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.740]   And I feel like that's a shame.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.740]   There's an opportunity loss.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.940]   Google spy whether you live in their house in their town.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:44.940]   They're spying on you.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:45.940]   They don't need the bill.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:46.940]   They've got the phone.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.940]   You've got their phone in your pocket.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.780]   You've got their search engine on your computer, but I don't want them in my city.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.380]   I guess a little anywhere.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.900]   Yeah, it's kind of too bad.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.420]   And now they want to plant their little earbudded by brain, right?
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.580]   If I stick this in a bit.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:59.580]   Have you used this?
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.900]   And Google might literally in my head.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.900]   Yeah, I have.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:02.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.740]   You just have the new pixel.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.460]   Because I'm going to lose them at some point.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.620]   Well, I ended up by video.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.620]   It just went down.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.340]   Yeah, everybody's videos just suddenly went downhill.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.340]   I don't know.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.340]   Wow.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.340]   Maybe it was us.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.340]   Yeah, no, I was listening.
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.820]   Unless we're under alien attack.
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:15.820]   Could be the whole world.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.820]   I don't know.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:22.020]   Something with something like this, this quarantine, you get this kind of strange mental state
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.020]   where it's like, are we living in an alternate timeline?
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.220]   Is there something I don't know going on?
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.220]   It is weird.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.180]   And there's nothing profound about what I'm about to say.
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:35.900]   But it is weird to think that we are literally living under essentially the same conditions
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   as the entire world.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.500]   I mean, those of us who are more affluent are living under better conditions.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.620]   But the entire world is under quarantine.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.620]   Is that bizarre?
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.620]   Have we ever had a global?
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.620]   We've had world war.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.620]   We've had world war.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.620]   But they aren't, they weren't literally world war.
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.620]   They were, you know, multiple countries.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.620]   But it's a weird.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:56.260]   I feel like there's an opportunity here for us to recognize national boundaries make no
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.980]   difference to a virus, right?
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:58.980]   That's right.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.380]   Maybe this is an opportunity for the world to understand we're all in this together on
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.260]   this little blue marble.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:09.340]   Maybe we ought to take better care of each other and stop fighting amongst each other.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.340]   I don't know.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.340]   Maybe that's crazy.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.340]   And I wonder whether this is going to give us any more thought about global warming because
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.540]   this ain't nothing compared to what global warming is going to do.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.140]   You know, it's going to affect every species on the planet.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:26.500]   Speaking of Google, Google has lost a battle in Australia that's potentially going to
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.500]   be costly.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:32.980]   I don't know if it's costly for Google or costly for Australia.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:39.220]   Australia courts have ruled that Google and Facebook too for that matter should be paying
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:47.020]   publishers millions of dollars annually for publishing tidbits snippets they call them
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:52.140]   from the publishers content on Google news and in Google search results.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:58.580]   Google Australia responded by saying, "This is like charging the news agent because they
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:05.860]   put your newspaper up in the window to sell more copies for the content.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.580]   The risk ultimately is not to Google.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.140]   The risk is probably to Australia in the past when this has happened in Spain and I think
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.140]   in France.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.260]   Google just said, "Fine.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:24.180]   We don't have to give people search results leading to your publication.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:27.340]   We can not do that."
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:35.180]   Google sent more than two billion visitors to Australian news sites from Australian users.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:40.380]   And a further billion visitors from users outside of Australia in 2018, Google said,
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.100]   "That was a two-way value exchange.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.180]   We got value, but you got value too.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.900]   Negotiations for some sort of voluntary agreement installed."
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:59.460]   And it looks like the government has said, "Google is going to have to start paying Google,
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:03.820]   I suspect, if forced to pay, if they can't get away out of this, we'll just walk as they
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.820]   have."
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.900]   And the off-shot is it'll hurt publishers.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.860]   How do people find you if they can't Google you?
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.660]   Is that too much power for Google?
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.740]   I don't understand it.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.940]   All I know is that if somebody who wants people to come to my website, they think most
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.740]   people want people to go.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.100]   And if you want to put up a paywall, put up a paywall, and some people are going to
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.860]   pay, and some people are going to go away.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.660]   But I've never understood Murdoch has been pushing this for years.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.940]   And I've never quite understand the economics about why you would want to not be picked
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:35.940]   up by Google.
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.860]   I mean, people spend millions on SEO for the purpose of getting picked up on Google.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:45.220]   And Larry, would you mind if they had a little snippet from connect safely.org on the search
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.340]   result to tell people what they're going to find there?
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.340]   No, not at all.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.340]   In fact, I would expect that.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:56.100]   I would expect that, you know, as you mentioned, the news agent putting up the sample newspaper,
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.980]   you need to look at the headline and maybe the first paragraph to decide if you want
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.940]   to read it and buy it in the case of news sites.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.860]   But on the flip side, just playing devil's advocate here, on the flip side as we move
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.260]   more to voice.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.420]   And if you look at what Google has done, I agree.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:13.580]   I think that it's like me posting a video from CES on Instagram and all of a sudden it's
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.820]   regrammed by a dozen of these random other random technology Instagrams.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:20.060]   And of course, I'm like, eh, it kind of sucks.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.260]   What does that do for me?
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.780]   It does give you a little exposure.
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.700]   Does every one of those people end up following you?
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.180]   Probably not.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.180]   So you see the good and the bad.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:33.740]   But as we move towards voice, a lot of these results with Google are sort of given in a
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.860]   verbal way.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.940]   So it's like, according to Connect Safely, here's what you do to be safe on the Internet.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.940]   It'll tell you.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.940]   Right.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.940]   I don't know.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.940]   Did that do anything for you?
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.840]   I don't know.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.100]   Probably get more good than harm is my sense.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:51.500]   I mean, I suppose if I was charging access to my site and people weren't paying because
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.860]   they could get it free, sure.
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.660]   But I don't think there are that many.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.140]   Look, I see I happen to have a subscription to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:03.140]   But I'm constantly seeing snippets of stuff from there.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.260]   And often going ahead and reading the entire article and sometimes not.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.380]   But would I cancel my subscription to the Wall Street Journal because I don't need it?
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.780]   I mean, for example, I don't have an LA time subscription.
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:16.620]   I'm thinking about getting one because Google has been showing me lately that they're doing
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.620]   a lot of great coverage.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.420]   And I'm probably going to go ahead and subscribe.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:24.100]   And see, that's interesting because on the flip side, two things.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.060]   I see the LA Times articles as well.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.380]   They're always coming through to my Google News.
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.380]   And I click on them.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.220]   And now I've been trained to know that like, oh, I'm not going to be able to read that because
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.020]   I don't have a subscription to that.
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:39.220]   And so in Google News, I'll be even more devil's advocate, you can actually block access to
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.220]   a provider.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:44.940]   So if the LA Times serves you up three articles that you can't read, now you're finally like,
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.900]   all right, let me just block LA Times.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.300]   And here's the other side of things.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:55.300]   A blog in almost every circumstance re-blogs what someone has reported.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.020]   And so that's almost, I think, the bigger issue, more so than Google, because I think
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.660]   Google probably does a better idea with their algorithms of sending you to the original
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:03.660]   article, right?
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:04.660]   Like the source.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.660]   Yeah, that's the goal.
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.300]   And then if I'm looking for something, that's what happens.
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   I Google it.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.260]   I see the clip and I click the link and I go to the site.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.260]   Right.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.460]   You want the original report.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:18.620]   That's what I think I'm a lot of rad people.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.180]   I mean, honestly, very legitimate news sources like CNET or, you know, I shouldn't say this.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:25.380]   We'll blog about what the Wall Street Journal covered.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:29.460]   But this entire show, everything we do on Twitter is made up of us talking about other
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.180]   people's news stories.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:37.660]   So, I mean, honestly, we're completely free writing on all the good work that people like
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:42.340]   Larry and Rich do.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.340]   We provide commentary.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.220]   Oh, I do that as a broadcast.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:51.340]   My radio shows are almost exclusively based on what I read in the news.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.380]   And I do give credit if they have anything to expect.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.380]   Right.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:58.100]   I try to mention where I saw the author.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.100]   Absolutely.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:02.460]   But it's not like I'm driving traffic to the Wall Street Journal about that Elon Musk article.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.180]   I'm just giving them credit.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.180]   But are you not though?
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:11.020]   I think you are because I saw someone tweeted about that article earlier and, you know,
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.660]   they tweeted about it and they kind of summarize it a little bit.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.660]   And then I went and read it.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:20.100]   And so, I mean, I think it all comes back to that whole like, you know, it's better to
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.900]   be there than to not be there.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.100]   And I think that that just makes more sense.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.580]   Now, if someone's just stealing your stuff, if it's a copy clone of the Wall Street Journal
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:32.460]   and you're just going there every day and reading the whole thing without a subscription,
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:33.460]   that's a little bit different.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.020]   That's not in the same spirit of what Google is trying to do.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.020]   Right.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.020]   According to what I think.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.020]   Right.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.500]   Let's take a break.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.700]   Rich tomorrow.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.620]   My, my doppelganger.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.700]   See how much we look alike.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.700]   We could be.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.380]   Hey, who's doing your hair though, Rich?
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.940]   I got to tell you, you look like you've had a haircut.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.940]   No.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.940]   I have not had a haircut.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:55.940]   Oh, man.
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.940]   We just a little longer than I'm ex-headroom though.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.940]   Oh, maybe it's a little.
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.500]   I'm trying to get as high as possible.
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:03.820]   I keep going higher.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.820]   I love it.
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.300]   I'm just going higher and higher every day.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.420]   Oh, that's maybe that's what I should do.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.420]   Just go.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.420]   Yeah, go high.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.420]   That's it.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.420]   You need a mohawk.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.420]   You need a mohawk.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.300]   I've seen the eye and spine going.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.620]   It's really out of control.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.100]   My wife just looked.
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.100]   I was kind of the garrison killer.
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.660]   My wife and the YouTube galoon had to give haircuts.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.820]   I saw that and she learned and you let her.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.260]   I was looking horrible.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:31.740]   I had my hair with this.
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.260]   I look like Einstein without the brains.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:39.860]   I'm in that awkward stage between a tidy haircut and a man bun.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.300]   Yeah, you got to do the man bun.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.300]   Yeah, a couple of months.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.300]   Go for the whole man bun.
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.580]   In a couple of months, at least I'll have a ponytail.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.580]   See that would clean it up.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.580]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:49.580]   Maybe that's what I need to do.
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.580]   Just do a little pony in the bun.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.580]   All right, these are my.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:55.260]   I think my upload speed must have suddenly dropped to get my video.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.580]   Yeah, your quality is terrible.
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.380]   Let's call them in the back.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.620]   Larry, if you've got Chrome in the background.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.940]   Yes, turn off Dropbox thinking.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.940]   Email.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.780]   Maybe your wife is watching more of those.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.780]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.780]   Cut hair, YouTube videos.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.780]   She might be watching Netflix.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.780]   I don't know.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:14.220]   No, it's weird because I have a pretty fast connection, but for some reason uploads.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   Completely degraded.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.020]   Yeah, it's completely degraded.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.020]   Horrible.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.020]   That's right.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.020]   You got a moment.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.100]   Talk about our sponsors.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.620]   World wide technology.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:31.100]   I have a soft spot for worldwide technology because it's the last trip I ever took.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:37.340]   In March, seems like 100 years ago, we flew out to worldwide technologies, world headquarters
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.860]   in St. Louis to visit their advanced technology center.
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.340]   I thought this is heaven.
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.260]   This is a paradise.
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:50.340]   The advanced technology center, they started building it about a decade ago and it has
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.140]   grown like crazy.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.140]   It's a testing lab.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.140]   It's a research lab.
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:54:01.540]   It's where WWT's engineers create pilots, proofs of concept, they set up technologies
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.860]   before they show them to clients.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:07.300]   They let clients come in and try technologies.
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:12.540]   More than half a billion dollars of equipment at the advanced technology center from hundreds
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.180]   of OEMs and key partners.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:22.380]   I mean, everybody's in their high tech heavyweights like Cisco, like VMware, AI disruptors like
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:23.380]   NVIDIA.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:27.580]   The point is the WWT is a trusted partner, stays with you over the years.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.620]   Many of their customers have been with them for decades.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.540]   They know WWT's where they can go to get the answers they need.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:36.980]   A lot of this really has to do with the advanced technology center.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.460]   It's an incubator for IT innovation.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:46.140]   One demand and schedulable labs or workshops like NVIDIA's deep learning workshop along
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.740]   with hundreds of other labs representing the newest advances in architectural solutions
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:57.500]   to help you as a customer accelerate in areas like AI and machine learning and more.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.180]   Learn about products before you launch them.
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:05.900]   WWT's engineers are always in there working on stuff, inventing stuff, trying stuff so
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.060]   that their customers can confidently choose the best solutions.
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.060]   It really makes a difference.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:17.300]   It reduces the time from concept to deployment from months to weeks.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.900]   In this fast paced world of enterprise technology, time is money.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:26.820]   They also offer something completely unique and I really was impressed by this.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.900]   That ATC isn't just theirs.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:29.900]   It's yours too.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:30.980]   They offer it as a service.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:35.940]   They call it lab as a service, a dedicated lab space within the ATC where you could perform
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.860]   programmatic testing using the vast technology ecosystem.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.620]   WWT's already built.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:45.700]   You don't have to go to St. Louis to use the ATC.
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:46.700]   It's virtual.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:52.380]   You could take advantage of the ATC's benefits anywhere in the world 24/7.
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:56.420]   Beta test new solutions based on the latest and greatest NVIDIA technologies.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.940]   Build reference architectures and custom integrations to help your customers.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:04.900]   Help their customers make decisions and see results faster with a lot less investment.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.900]   It's amazing.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:10.100]   The thing, if you're interested in AI, if you're interested in machine learning, if you want
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:14.780]   to try these great NVIDIA technology, this is a way to do it.
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.300]   For free, easily, painlessly.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.860]   This incredible advanced technology center ecosystem creates a multiplier effective knowledge
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:27.540]   of speed, of agility, anytime, anywhere around the world for their customers.
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:31.140]   And by the way, it's more than just the labs you get access to case studies, to articles.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.100]   In fact, there's information right there waiting for you.
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.940]   You can go and read up.
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.740]   All the tools you'll need to make a difference in today's fast-paced world.
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:45.020]   I think WWT's customers know this, but I want you to know it too.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.140]   They are amazing.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.900]   Become a member of the growing WWT community.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.820]   Get access to the ATC.
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.900]   Go to www.wt.com/twit.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:57:00.580]   And then try out these on-demand labs, just the information, the value you're going to
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:01.580]   get.
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.660]   And nowadays, we're all looking about moving to the cloud, about AI, about machine learning.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.260]   This is the place to do it.
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:10.340]   WWT simplifies the complex.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:14.060]   The website, again, www.wt.com/twit.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:18.420]   Worldwide technology delivering business and technology outcomes around the world.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.420]   A great partner.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.260]   We're really happy to have them.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:26.260]   As our friends on the journey.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.260]   How are we doing, Larry?
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.260]   I don't know.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.260]   How's my video?
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.260]   Is it any better?
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.260]   It's about the same.
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:33.020]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.460]   Now I'm getting better.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.460]   I don't know.
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:37.300]   Actually, that raises an interesting question.
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:41.220]   There's been a lot of conversation lately about, "Ah ha!
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:47.020]   See, the internet service providers really didn't need those bandwidth caps, Comcast,
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.820]   Cox, and Frontier.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:53.220]   All said, 'Oh, if we don't have bandwidth caps, you guys will just kill the network.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:56.260]   We're protecting the network against the bandwidth hogs.
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:01.540]   Of course, during the crisis, they've, for good reason, lifted the bandwidth caps as
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.460]   more and more as I was working from home.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:06.020]   Have we noticed a degradation?
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:08.380]   Did they really need those bandwidth caps in the first place?
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.380]   Rich, what do you think?
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:10.380]   You're...
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:12.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.660]   I think that it's probably the top question I'm getting from people in internet service.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.660]   Yep.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.660]   Just seems horrible.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:19.660]   Okay.
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:21.100]   Now here's the thing.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:26.260]   I think that 99% of internet issues in people's homes have to do with their Wi-Fi, the way
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.260]   it's set up.
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:28.260]   Yep.
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.260]   It was Wi-Fi.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.980]   I think today on the radio show, I had four or five callers with bad Wi-Fi.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:33.980]   And I'm heart-wiring.
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:34.980]   I can't blame Wi-Fi.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:35.980]   I can't blame Wi-Fi.
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:41.260]   Because back in the day, you had one device, you had your laptop, and you had your router
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.500]   underneath your TV.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.500]   Right.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.620]   And you would use your laptop and you'd use your phone, it was fine.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:47.900]   Then all of a sudden, people started getting video doorbells.
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:51.340]   And that's when they realized the Wi-Fi did not reach the other end of their home, even
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:52.900]   though it wasn't that far away.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.580]   And now it's this whole big thing with all these smart home devices.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:59:01.060]   So 99% of the time you recommend Euro or be the Google and it's, you're fine.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.060]   You've been listening to the radio show, Rich.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.100]   Of course, every weekend video.
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.700]   But how about the ISPs?
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.660]   Do you think they're, are they suffering?
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:13.420]   I mean, clearly Larry's ISP is suffering right now, right?
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:14.420]   Something going on.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:18.860]   I switched to a lower resolution camera, but that's not helping either.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:19.860]   No, I'm not.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.860]   Here's the deal.
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:22.500]   I've been thinking about it.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.060]   Your audio is fine.
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.980]   So that's the most important thing from my point of view.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:27.980]   That's true.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.980]   We don't need to see you.
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:34.860]   Yeah, I'm not much to look at, but there's no question that my, because I normally, I
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:39.260]   pay for 200 megabits, which is pretty much the most I can pay for unless I want to pay
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:40.860]   a ridiculous amount.
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.580]   And I typically get 300 megabits.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.780]   But lately I'm lucky to get 90, which is still plenty.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.980]   But for some reason, my upside speed is really bad, right?
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:52.780]   Now my upside is, upload is bad right now for reasons that I don't understand.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.420]   That's probably you, not, not Comcast.
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:57.660]   I don't know, because I do, you know, I do regular webcasts and this is the first time
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:58.660]   it's happened.
[00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.660]   Maybe it's you, Leo.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.660]   Could be us.
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.660]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.140]   It's everyone FaceTiming for Mother's Day.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.140]   That's what's happening.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:08.700]   This is probably going to be the worst day of them all, right?
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.700]   Mm hmm.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.700]   It's good.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.700]   People are on.
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.700]   It's true.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.100]   It's telling me, my wife told me, you know, she'd say at like seven o'clock at night,
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.620]   you know, I go to sleep super early for the morning show and she would say at night,
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.680]   she'd be like, you know, our internet goes out, like Netflix looks terrible and every
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.700]   dad come home at three o'clock and I'd say, it looks fine to me.
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.700]   It's good.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:31.860]   And finally one night I'm up late and sure enough, I'm like, what is this crazy?
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:32.860]   What's going on?
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:35.180]   But now people are online all day.
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.220]   I mean, my neighbors are actually, you know, I have a cable modem, which means I'm sharing
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:42.540]   down growth with my natives, my neighbors and they have the adaptivity to you.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.540]   I call my neighbors natives as me.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.540]   Native neighbors.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.540]   They lived here before you.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.540]   Most of my name, I went on your street before you moved.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.860]   I wonder if it's Skype.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:56.300]   I mean, because we're on Skype here, I know more about Zoom than I do about Skype, but
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:02.220]   I know that their system is monitoring upstream and it could be locked in middle.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.660]   It's locked larry at a lower usually adjust after a while.
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.660]   It'll adjust.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.420]   Never had a problem like if I zoom.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.260]   I mean, I'm on zoom many times a week.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.940]   Oh, God, you guys are killing me with a zoom.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:16.060]   Do you really want me to switch this whole network to zoom?
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.060]   No, no, we're not saying that.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.180]   I'm just saying that it may be making it could be spike.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.100]   Skype is, is, but I will say something.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.100]   I'm larry.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.100]   There are no reasons.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.100]   It is.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.100]   Judgment.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.100]   Yes.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.300]   I think zoom is right now finally one of the most secure services in the world.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.740]   I mean, they have bent over backwards and done some results in response to all the problems
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:39.140]   they had early on during the pandemic to the point now where they are annoying me by
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.660]   forcing me to use password when I don't want to use password.
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:46.300]   Yes, it's now annoying because if you're just responsible with your code, you'd be fine.
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.260]   But security is annoying.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.260]   Security is purely annoying.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.260]   It's by design.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:54.060]   But doc, you're right that it is annoying, but I, and I love to tell people it's like,
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.020]   it's supposed to be like my kids want me to download something to their iPad.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.020]   I got to go.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.380]   I got to find my password that's like super complex.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380]   I got to find theirs.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.180]   It's supposed to be annoying because guess what?
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:06.540]   If it's easy and your password is simple, it's easy.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.180]   Anybody could do it.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.780]   You don't want that.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:14.300]   So let's talk a little bit about zoom because this is of course a great success story of
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.780]   quarantine has been zoom.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.300]   First of all, why zoom?
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.900]   There are hundreds of ways to do this.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:27.820]   Most people have a variety of things already on their system, including for Apple users
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:32.580]   FaceTime for Facebook users, Facebook or WhatsApp.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.220]   There's Google meeting.
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.900]   There's, I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.380]   What was it about zoom?
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:43.860]   Which I don't think most home users had ever used or heard of or heard of.
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:49.460]   Why did zoom go from 10 million daily active users in December to 200 million in March?
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.340]   There's a little question about the number.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:56.260]   I think they gave out 700 million or something last month and then they retracted it.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.860]   Nevertheless, we're talking significant growth.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.420]   Why?
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.420]   They're marginally easier.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:06.180]   They were a little bit better and a little bit got a lot more.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:10.180]   Is it because they, the people who had the only people who had done this.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.180]   Google's a verb.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.980]   Now, now you're breaking up.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.900]   The only thing you were breaking up.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.900]   You wouldn't have to zoom in breaking up the target.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.500]   If you were on zoom, this wouldn't happen.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.980]   Oh my God.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.940]   So I, I, yeah, go ahead.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.940]   Go ahead.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.940]   Go ahead.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.940]   Go ahead.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:34.260]   I think that the probably what happened is everybody at home had never done anything
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.260]   like this.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.820]   I mean, we'd all done one or two face-to-face calls.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:42.700]   But the idea of having 20 people in a meeting hadn't occurred to us.
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.740]   So you have to say, well, what did they use at work?
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.220]   And that's, that's the first thing that happened.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.220]   Was zoom dominant in business before this?
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.220]   It's an enterprise company.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.420]   And that was part of their problem.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.940]   They actually had pretty good enterprise security.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.500]   The problem is that their documentation was written for IT professionals.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:04.460]   And most users had no idea how to turn on the security that was there.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.940]   So now they had to make it a default.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:06.940]   The defaults were wrong.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:07.940]   The defaults were wrong.
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:08.940]   The defaults were wrong for good.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:14.060]   Most of the time, I mean, the way the company explained it, they said that the, the IT
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.540]   professional, you know, because most of the time was enterprise.
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.860]   So you would be a big company.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.580]   You'd sign up and your IT people would sort of delegate the security settings for your
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.220]   corporate, you know, for your organization.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:29.780]   And when people started using it at home, if you look at, I mean, zoom settings are insane.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:33.260]   They're not for the mere mortal because there are so many of them.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.700]   None of them make any sense.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.940]   And the one feature that every average person found was the virtual background, which was
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.660]   like the most fun feature.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.500]   And it's so stupid.
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:47.180]   But, you know, but I think the reason why zoom took off is because the companies latched
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.420]   on board immediately, all those employees came home.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:54.660]   They started using it with their friends because it was unlimited and you can have all the
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.860]   fun people on the grid.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.100]   It was easy to send a link to everyone.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.900]   I don't know how people got their friends to install this because if I try to get any
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:06.020]   one of my friends to install some sort of new video chat app that I'm asking or because
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.460]   I'm testing it, they're like, no, no, I'm good.
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.460]   I've got FaceTime.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.460]   I've got this.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:14.900]   It's like, the reality in the world installed zoom overnight.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.900]   >> But it's automatic.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.900]   When you go to the website and you join it, when you join a chat, it just automatically
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.900]   installs.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:20.900]   >> It's kind of brainless.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:21.900]   >> Well, I don't like that.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:22.900]   >> It's not enough.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.900]   >> It's easy.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.900]   >> It's great.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.740]   I have to say, here's a big reason that zoom's a success.
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.180]   The app is uncomplicated.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:36.020]   It automatically installs the app, as Larry was saying.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.900]   And yeah, that's annoying that they didn't hardly ask permission to do that.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.780]   But then again, WebEx and the other ones, they have something like that too.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.540]   But their app is simple.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.460]   You look at Skype's app and it's gigantic.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:50.860]   It wants to be social and it's got a lot of old crap that you don't care about.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.060]   Zoom's app is nice and simple and it works.
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:54.060]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.780]   That's an interesting corollary because it's simple on the surface.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.300]   So the end user thinks it's simple by doing horrific things behind the scenes.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.300]   >> Yes.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.300]   And they did.
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   They had to figure out ways around the security of Apple computers and Mac, Apple and Windows.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:16.460]   And the other thing is, if you say no every single time it tries to install that app,
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.460]   it will run in the browser just fine.
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.780]   But they don't want it to run in the browser.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   They want it to be sticky on your system so that when someone calls you, it immediately
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780]   pops up.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.940]   I mean, I get why they did what they did.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:30.660]   But it was a very dark kind of, what do they call it, dark pattern.
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.900]   >> It was a dark pattern.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.900]   >> Yeah.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.900]   >> It was.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.900]   And I don't like them for that reason.
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:39.080]   And that's why I've kind of always been like, egh, I'm not, that's what I don't like about
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:43.000]   Zoom, even though I will say I've tested all these different apps and Zoom is the most
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   fun.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.240]   It has the most features and it's undeniably easy.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:51.920]   >> Well, the other thing is, and I've noticed this, you're not making friends if you say,
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.080]   I don't want to use Zoom.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:57.520]   I want to use product X because they then have to install product X.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.800]   My Mac at home has big blue button, blue jeans, blue.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.560]   It has all of these apps.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.840]   And I'm thinking as soon as this is over, I'm wiping the drive and I'm never installing
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.400]   any of this stuff again.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.040]   So I've experienced this.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.200]   We have a JITZ server running, which requires nothing.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.200]   It's WebRTC.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.760]   It's just web-based.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:23.160]   But I can't convince anybody, even in my own company, to use it.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   >> No.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.160]   >> Because they already use it.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.160]   >> No, the name like that.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   >> JITZ, is that the problem?
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.800]   It's the name.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:34.760]   >> I went to the JITZ website because I saw the little silhouette on a broadcast.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   I was like, what's that one?
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.200]   I'm not aware of that.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.440]   And I went to the website and it was clear to me that this is the reason why only nerds
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.600]   are installing this one.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.960]   It's because it's a nerd one.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.280]   I mean, I hate to say that one.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.120]   >> It sounds like a mold or a spoon being a nerd.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:55.560]   >> It sounds like a mold or a secretion or something like that.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:00.280]   >> God, I thought I was like a martial arts studio.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.560]   >> The other thing about Zoom, it's a martial arts.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.000]   >> I just want to show you, this is JITZ.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.640]   I don't even have to tell people it's JITZ.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.400]   I can just say go to twit.team.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:14.200]   It's got the twit logo on it, not the JITZ logo on it.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   It looks like Zoom.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.000]   I can have multiple people in here.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.800]   There's nothing in here right now because my camera's not turned on.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.800]   But I feel like that looks pretty good.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.800]   >> That's what I'm saying.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.800]   >> Show us their website though.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.800]   Show us the website that you have to go to download.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.800]   >> But you don't have to.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.800]   >> No, you don't have to.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.800]   >> That's what I installed as server.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.800]   >> If I'm trying it.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.800]   >> No, you go to twit.team.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.800]   I'm going to try it.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.480]   >> Yeah, but if I go to twit.team, but I can't even convince people to do that.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.040]   Because I did all of that.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040]   But that doesn't matter.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   It's right.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   No, then that's the point.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040]   That's my point.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   There's better ways.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.920]   >> We've got two things coming down the pipeline.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.960]   I don't know if you guys have tried Google Meet.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.440]   I finally got access.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.720]   I was like for brushing my Gmail every day.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.520]   >> You hate it?
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.920]   >> Well, maybe I'm not using Google Meet.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.200]   But we use Hangout Meats all the time for work.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.760]   If we don't use Zoom, internally we use Google and it's awful.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.240]   >> Well, I do.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.720]   >> I feel like the Meet, I don't know.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.880]   I thought Meet was pretty good.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.840]   My only problem is they don't give you the grid view.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.040]   But the trick is that you're tiny.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.520]   And I think that people like to see themselves on the same grid as everyone else.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.840]   Like, why am I so tiny?
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.520]   And I think that's going to kill it.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520]   Number one.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   >> Yep.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.200]   >> Number two, we've got Facebook Messenger Rooms coming up.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.960]   I think that it's, I don't know, people love and hate Facebook because of the privacy stuff.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.720]   But it's going to be unlimited.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.440]   Don't forget right now, if you're in a group meeting on Zoom and you're not paying, you
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.400]   are hitting that 40 minute limit.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:44.000]   Whereas on Facebook Messenger, it's going to be totally free for 100 people, whatever
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   it is.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.520]   >> Here's the thing with Zoom.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.880]   One person in that group always has a paid account.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.280]   There's always somebody has a paid account.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.280]   >> Yes.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:55.840]   But I don't want to be on my corporate account for my personal Friday night poker game.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840]   I don't know.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.640]   Just to me, that doesn't make sense.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.040]   Everyone's like, oh, I'll host it.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.520]   I'm a lawyer or I'm an educator.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520]   I'm like, you really?
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.400]   You don't know who's tracking this stuff.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.520]   >> If you have just a regular $15 a month paid account, only one person can use the
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520]   account at the time.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.120]   So, connect safely has one.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:15.480]   If I want to use it for my Friday night poker game and my colleague wants to use it for
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.840]   hers, one of us is going to get locked out.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.280]   >> I ain't buying another Zoom account just so I can't do it.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   >> Exactly buying another Zoom account.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.080]   We actually upgraded to webinar.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.240]   It's funny, Zoom has an amazing amount of bait and switch.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.840]   We're paying something like $80 a month now for our Zoom account.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.840]   >> I want to use Zoom.
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.440]   >> We still can only have like 100 people can be in our meetings.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   >> I want to hate Zoom.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.440]   I really do.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.800]   Yet, that's the default.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.720]   Again, that was the question I asked.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720]   Why is it?
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.080]   Microsoft, very early on, said, we'll give you teams.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.720]   Everybody, Google said, okay, no more limits on meets.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.240]   >> Part of it, I think the name teams.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.600]   Everything else sounds so enterprise.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.120]   Even though Zoom gives enterprise, it sounds fun.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.240]   >> Zoom is a cool name.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.240]   It sounds fun.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.880]   >> It's better than Jitzy.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   It's better than Jitzy.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.520]   Teams, come on, Microsoft Teams, it's like number one, they've had Skype forever.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.720]   Nobody, I tell people I do all my interviews for TV over Skype and people are like, they're
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.720]   grossed out.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.440]   They don't want to give me their username like, oh, Skype.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.880]   They don't, they hate it.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.880]   I'm like, what's so bad about Skype?
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.800]   And it's like people, you get a link.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.920]   If you even mentioned Zoom to someone, you get a link text at you before you even finish
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   saying, can we Zoom?
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.400]   I mean, it's like, I've never seen anything take off like this in the tech world with
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.000]   such a complicated product like that's not built into every device.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.800]   Apple spent years building a FaceTime into everything and people use it.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.600]   Google can't figure it out for 10 years with Duo and all these things and Zoom doesn't
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.600]   overnight.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:48.640]   >> I feel bad for go to meeting because they own this space for so long and Cisco Webex,
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.880]   they feel bad for them.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.600]   They own this space.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.880]   They were the corporate choice and they haven't.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.080]   >> It's significant that the Zoom guys left.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.320]   >> Do they come from Webex?
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.160]   >> Go to meeting or Webex, one of them.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.640]   >> They don't know that.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   >> Whichever one was owned by Cisco.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.640]   >> Yeah, that's Webex.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.960]   >> And they didn't have a covenant not to compete or anything.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.440]   It's just that they walked and they started another company.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.400]   So they already had experience with what not to do, I suppose.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   That has to help.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.360]   >> I want to tell the back channel that I'm making a joke about Jitzy as the plus guy.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360]   I like Jitzy.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   >> Jitzy's good.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360]   >> But nobody, nobody.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.280]   >> I can't even get my family to use.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.960]   >> I would use Skype if Microsoft would make it easier to use.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.520]   I just find the UI confusing.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.080]   >> We force people to use Skype.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.400]   You're all on Skype.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.240]   We have to force people to do it, but it's the best quality we've had been able to get.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.240]   >> Joke today.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.240]   >> Joke today.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:54.080]   >> So the reason Zoom's in the news is because they've realized that their reputation was
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.680]   mud and they did an amazing thing.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.520]   They turned it around very, very quickly.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.940]   I'm wondering though what the panel thinks.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:06.080]   If this is a real turnaround or if this is a PR turnaround.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   Because in the past, we've seen Zoom do the PR thing without doing the real thing.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.120]   So they hired a consultant, and we've talked about this before, Alex Stamos very famously
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:23.440]   was at Yahoo and then at Facebook and he's a well respected person in security.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:31.680]   They hired Katie Missouri's company that is a bug bounty company to help them track down
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.680]   bugs and pay people for tracking down bugs.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.860]   And most recently this week, and I was a little miffed, they acquired a company nobody's
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:44.340]   ever heard of except that I was a big fan of Keybase at Keybase.io.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.780]   These guys are super good crypto guys.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:51.780]   They have about 25 person team in New York that's really all about crypto and they brought
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:55.800]   them in to support the end to end encryption on Zoom.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:02.040]   It does put Keybase, which I had used for I think several years in jeopardy.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.060]   They sounds like it's an acquire.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:07.220]   They're going to put all their energies into making Zoom secure.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:13.260]   These are good hires, but they're, are they, are they what Zoom needs to do?
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.900]   They announced we're not going to add features.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.620]   In fact, they famously lost out on a Facebook deal.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:23.380]   They were working with Facebook on Facebook's messaging platform and had to move off of
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.780]   it because they said we're not going to work on new features.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.300]   We're going to work on security only.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.620]   They saw that as the big opportunity.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.140]   What do you, let's see, let's ask Rich.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.300]   What do you think, Rich?
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.820]   Is this real security or security?
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.820]   >> I think so.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.100]   No, I think it's real security.
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:46.980]   I think that this company realizes they have exactly one opportunity to become a thing.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:51.900]   Right now, we don't know what's going to happen after this whole pandemic passes if and when
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.900]   it does.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.900]   Hopefully it does.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.660]   I think Zoom knows that.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:01.380]   They know that they've caught some fire here and they are ready to just ride that to the
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.380]   win.
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.140]   I think they can.
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:08.900]   I think that they really can and it's just going to take a matter of like you said, their
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:14.900]   reputation was mud in the public's eye and of course the major media, you say Zoom and
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.700]   you think security problems.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.460]   But I think they can get over it because I think they, like you said, they made a lot
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:24.260]   of changes in the past couple of weeks that truly do make the service more secure.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.580]   I think they will get through it.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:31.420]   >> I'm sure you know Alex and Katie and their reputation in the security community.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:35.340]   But at the same time, Alex is not an employee, Katie's not an employee.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:41.460]   It's almost as if they're putting together a team of people who confront for Zoom.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.940]   Do you think they've done enough?
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:52.340]   >> Well, I just checked on several different browsers and let's see, am I right?
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.820]   Okay, they haven't.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.740]   All right, so I may trouble for them.
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:59.940]   In fact, I may have started the avalanche on March 27th.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.260]   >> Well, I wrote a blog post.
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:03.980]   >> That's right, you're the one who wrote the piece.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:07.860]   >> Yeah, I wrote a blog post called Zoom Needs to Clean Up Its Privacy Act.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.860]   >> You were the guy?
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:15.500]   >> Three more after that, including, and then Eric Guand, the CEO reached out to me and
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.060]   said, and he seemed very sincere about it.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:23.100]   I really want to fix this and I really want your help and anybody's help.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:30.180]   And I want to see here if they actually did the one thing I asked them to do, which is
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:32.540]   get rid of, yeah, no, they didn't.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:38.460]   Okay, so they still have trust arc on the problem they had and the problem I'm telling
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:42.420]   you, they still have, is that their privacy policy, yeah, there it is.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:44.100]   >> Yeah, they've got a lot of courage.
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.900]   This Zoom needs to clean up its privacy.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:52.420]   >> Yeah, okay, it burned out my or Harvard's server for WordPress for that.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:58.220]   But anyway, their privacy policy, because they have tracking on their home page, they
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:03.500]   had weasel language in their privacy policy that said all the stuff you say, if you've
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.720]   got weasel language on your, if you've got weasel on your home page that allows third
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.860]   party trackers to come in and keep track of the cookies that you've agreed to, even though
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.660]   the GDPR and the CCPA told you not to.
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:21.700]   So there's a multi-azillion dollar business in avoiding the GDPR and avoiding the CCPA.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:27.140]   And obeying the letter but not the spirit of that, which is to stop tracking people.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.260]   So as long as they have tracking of some sort on their home page, it made it look like
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.420]   they have tracking on everything.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:35.340]   And I said, it makes you look like you're an advertising company.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:39.340]   And he told me, yeah, I'm going to, we're going to do what you say.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:40.340]   We're going to get rid of that.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:43.700]   And I said, you're going to have a fight with your marketing people, he says, I know that.
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.860]   But- >> And it's not the marketing people.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:49.500]   It's the lawyers who said, well- >> There's a lawyer in the marketing people.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.500]   >> We can't get rid of that.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.500]   There's a lot of lawyers who say that.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.300]   And they told him, you're lawyers who say it too.
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.580]   They're in a seller's market.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.740]   They do not need any, they call their home page a marketing page.
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:00.740]   It doesn't need to be.
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.740]   It needs to say we're zoomed.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.500]   >> Was that before this whole thing though?
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.780]   Maybe they thought that they had an opportunity there.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:10.700]   But, or was it just standard that every company that starts a web company just kind of does
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:11.700]   this stuff.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.820]   And now they're like, we have something bigger.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.260]   >> Well, you say that- >> Well, you're saying they haven't seen
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.260]   them.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:19.460]   >> Let me read the quote, Doc, because you say, here's the thing.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.380]   Zoom, and you do this in italics.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:24.940]   Zoom doesn't need to be in the advertising business.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:29.180]   Least of all, and the part of it that lives like a vampire off the blood of human data.
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:31.660]   If Zoom needs more money, charge more.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:33.100]   Or give less away for free.
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:37.220]   It's an extremely valuable service, performs well.
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:42.980]   It's a platform with lots of apps, and it should be interested in privacy.
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:45.940]   But what's interesting is it sounds like they still haven't.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:47.700]   This, you wrote this.
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.700]   What is the- >> March 20th.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:52.340]   >> So two weeks ago, and they still haven't responded.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.180]   >> Yeah, that's about it.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:55.180]   >> Three months.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.380]   >> A month and two weeks ago.
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.900]   Yeah, it's- >> Yeah, in COVID time, this forever.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.380]   >> Yeah, last decade.
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:01.380]   >> Yeah, practically.
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:02.380]   >> Yeah.
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:03.380]   >> Yeah.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:04.580]   And I'm sure what's happened.
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:06.580]   I think he was his seer.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.980]   He strikes me as a good guy.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:09.740]   I liked talking to him.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:15.180]   He was very modest and quite obviously shellacked by what happened.
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:20.060]   I mean, he had in the background, his false background, which you have with Zoom, was
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:24.860]   the San Francisco skyline with all the skyscrapers there.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:29.580]   And I said, well, what happened is all this building, exactly as Rich said, all this building
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:31.660]   is drained out and all this people went on to Zoom.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:35.580]   And then by the way, all of church and all of education and all of government and everything
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.660]   else went on to Zoom and they absorbed that somehow.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:44.620]   And by the way, credit Amazon as well for being a back end for that, which I'm told
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:47.860]   they are so that that's why the US is what has succeeded in the US.
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:49.420]   >> It does make me that it works.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.100]   I am just shocked that it has been crashed in the dark.
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:53.100]   >> It's remarkable.
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.100]   >> I agree.
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:55.100]   They have not had a major crash.
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.980]   I mean, that is phenomenal for what- >> No fail wheel.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:58.980]   >> For the growth.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:19:59.980]   >> Yeah.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:00.980]   >> That's amazing.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:02.140]   I mean, we haven't heard one story of that.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:05.460]   And you know that everyone's waiting for that story and it hasn't happened, which is
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:09.220]   just phenomenal, which gives me faith in this business.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:13.420]   I mean, I really, like I said, I don't want to like Zoom because of the way they installed
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:15.580]   their program on everyone's computer secretly.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:20.940]   But I have to give them credit for doing something kind of right and getting us all connected
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:23.740]   in this time that we've never experienced before.
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.740]   They somehow did it.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:28.300]   >> So Doc, is it safe to use Zoom now?
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.900]   >> I think it is.
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:32.980]   We had a Mother's Day family gathering for the first time.
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:34.740]   We had our first family Zoom.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:37.300]   >> Can you comment about the China stuff?
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:40.620]   Because I know every time I mention Zoom, people say everything goes through China.
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:41.620]   Is that true?
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:42.620]   Is that not true?
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:43.620]   >> That's the wrong idea.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.220]   >> It is not true.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:49.860]   At one point, some Zoom traffic was routed through China.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.740]   Zoom says that was an error.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.140]   It isn't normally.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.500]   Here's the larger issue to me.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:01.300]   Almost all of Zoom's code is written by three companies in mainland China.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:06.340]   And since their coders are in China, in my opinion, that makes them vulnerable because
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:12.260]   any company that is in China is partially owned by the Chinese government and is absolutely
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:15.060]   susceptible to interference by the Chinese government.
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.060]   That's just a nature of doing business there.
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:24.340]   So honestly, if Zoom really wanted to win my trust, perhaps they would start doing their
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.380]   coding somewhere else.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.900]   I don't -- doesn't have to be the US.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.180]   Do it in Switzerland if you want.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:34.740]   But does China or any authoritarian state Russia would be just as bad?
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.900]   That worries me a little bit.
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:41.260]   On the other hand, what are you doing on Zoom that you're worried that the Chinese government
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.260]   is going to get?
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.420]   >> Well, the government is using Zoom.
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.500]   >> Everything is happening on Zoom.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500]   I mean, everything.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.500]   >> Well, I have no perspective.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.420]   >> The Department of Defense has already said we're not using Zoom.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:54.020]   Elon Musk's SpaceX says we're not using Zoom.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.700]   NASA refuses to use Zoom.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.900]   The New York City freaking schools stopped using Zoom.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:21:59.900]   >> They started again.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:00.900]   >> Yeah, I know.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:01.900]   >> I think they started again.
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:02.900]   >> But the point is --
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:03.900]   >> We're actually --
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.820]   >> We had nothing to hide here.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:10.380]   So I think if you are the Defense Department, you probably shouldn't be using Zoom.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:12.380]   But for you and me and your other state --
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:13.380]   >> They got to use Jitsu.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:14.380]   >> Get them on Jitsu, Leo.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:15.380]   >> Jitsu.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:18.380]   >> I'm for Chik-Chok because the Chinese concern.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.380]   >> Oh, whoops.
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:27.260]   >> I'm going to mention one other name that they got on -- again, another consultant,
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:30.500]   Bruce Schneier is one of the most legendary security guys of all.
[01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.060]   He said, "I'm working for Zoom."
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:37.080]   Now I presume Katie Missouri's Bruce Schneier and Alex Stamos are going to not sit there
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:44.800]   and watch Zoom do untenable things, but they aren't employees, they're consultants.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.040]   The true employees are still in China.
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.040]   >> I don't know.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:53.760]   >> So Bruce is a friend of mine, and in fact, he privately encouraged me to give them a lot
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.200]   of grief once they started.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.920]   And I didn't -- he's working for Zoom now?
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.920]   That's going on.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920]   >> Yeah.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:22:59.920]   >> No shit.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:00.920]   >> Yeah, so that's a big --
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.160]   >> You probably did get him his job.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.160]   That was the --
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.200]   >> We have some more grief.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.840]   >> I thought that was actually -- let me see if I can find Zeus.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.840]   Bruce is posting here.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:20.520]   >> I knew he was working with Tim Berners-Lee on "Inrupt."
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520]   >> That one's really interesting.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520]   >> That one's really interesting.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:26.880]   I hope I'm not mistaken, but I think he said he's going to consult with them.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   Let me actually --
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.360]   >> That's still significant.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.080]   He's brilliant.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.080]   He's a great guy.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.640]   >> Oh, yeah, he knows his stuff.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.880]   >> I hope I'm not doing this by accident.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:45.120]   I want to make sure that I'm not assigning Bruce a job that he did not take, but I read
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.280]   his blog religiously, and I feel like he was talking about that.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.640]   He does talk in a more recent post about Zoom security and the DoD, and does say that
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.960]   Zoom is on the list of more secure choices.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:03.280]   But anyway, I think that -- I know I think you know this, Rich.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.200]   What's the concern people express is is it safe to use?
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:12.360]   And I think the answer for normal people for your mother's day call is absolutely, right?
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.000]   I would agree with that.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.760]   But on the flip side, this is an enterprise company.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.440]   It's primarily meant for businesses, so it should be safe with business transactions
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.560]   and conversations, so I would hope.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.480]   And I think they also got in trouble because that whole like encrypted end-to-end, where
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.480]   they really end-to-end encrypted, turn out they weren't.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:38.320]   And so I think that there's just -- Zoom is a very -- it's like -- what's that that
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.240]   clay that the kids make, the slime?
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240]   It's like they're like slime.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.680]   They're like, it's cool and it's fun to play with, but it just keeps dripping out of your
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.680]   hands.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.600]   You know, and you got to like bring it back up.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.600]   >> So there's the --
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600]   >> There's the pull quote there.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600]   >> Yeah, there's the pull quote.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   I don't like slime.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   Just pull that one out.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600]   There you go.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.200]   >> I don't think anyone has ever used that to describe a tech company before, but that's,
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.200]   you know.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.880]   >> The last thing before I got quarantined was the New York toy fair, and that's what
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.320]   I was playing with, was that slime.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.480]   And it just reminds me of Zoom now.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.480]   >> Yeesh.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.480]   >> Yeesh.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.840]   That's Rich D'Muro, Rich on Tech, Rich on Tech.com.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.840]   Is it .com?
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:16.840]   >> .tv.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:17.840]   >> .tv, that's right.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:18.840]   >> Of course.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.840]   >> Because you're a TV person, though.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.840]   >> The TV guy.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:21.840]   He looks good, too.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.840]   >> Yeah, it does.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:23.840]   Look at his hair.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.840]   Even without a haircut, his hair looks good.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.840]   I hate you.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.440]   I'm figuring -- I think your flow-by sales must be through the roof right about now.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.440]   I don't know.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440]   I don't know.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.440]   >> I don't know.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.440]   Love a flow-by.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.440]   >> Oh, anything, man.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:43.720]   I'm actually -- there's a haircut or a barber in Pennsylvania, Paul Therat's used him, who
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:47.720]   brings a standing tent with armholes in it.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.360]   He just stands in the tent.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.600]   He puts his arms in the hole, cuts your hair.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.600]   >> Oh, that's --
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.600]   >> Yeah, it's like surgery.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.600]   >> Even when I feel like the spirit of right now is no haircut.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.960]   This is the one time in your life when you can go and -- no one has a haircut.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.960]   So why not just let it grow as I have --
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.960]   >> I grew up in the '60s, so I already had that.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.640]   But I'm wondering, how do you do a massage in Georgia and stay six feet away?
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:10.640]   Is that --
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.640]   >> First one.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.640]   >> First one, yeah.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.280]   >> First person, you have fire as your massage therapist.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.280]   I don't know.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.320]   >> Do you know what a difference -- you know the difference between a good and a bad haircut?
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.480]   >> What's that?
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:22.480]   >> About two weeks.
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:24.200]   >> That's true.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.000]   My last haircut I knew this was going to be my last haircut for a while.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.240]   I told my hair cut her.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.040]   I said, I think it's going to be getting pretty long.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.720]   Can you cut it so that it will wear well?
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:36.480]   She says, I always cut it so well.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.040]   But I don't know if she planned on this.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.040]   This is --
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:42.200]   >> I got those wings that come up in the back.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.200]   >> Yeah.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.800]   I don't even bother worrying about the back because you can't see it.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.800]   >> Oh, that's why I need that.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800]   >> I have a clipper.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.800]   I mow my hair.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.800]   I don't cut it.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.800]   I just mow it over a little more.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.800]   >> I need a mow it over a little more.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:52.800]   >> I tried to buy clippers.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.240]   But they're also sold out.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.240]   You can't buy them.
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.240]   >> Oh, really?
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.240]   >> You can buy beard clippers.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.240]   But you can't buy hair.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.240]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.240]   They sold out early.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.240]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.240]   Really?
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.240]   >> This is what I'm saying with Amazon.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.240]   It's like a --
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.240]   >> We think it did.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.840]   >> In normal times, anything you need is on your doorstep in two days.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.080]   And this is just not the case.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.160]   I mean, not the case right now.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.160]   >> Okay.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.760]   You want to take money on whether Jeff Bezos is caping very close scrutiny on everything
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.240]   that's in shortage and high demand.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.600]   And he's going to stockpile up because the next time he's going to be ready.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600]   >> You know, webcams.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.960]   They're all -- you can't buy a web cam on a line right now.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.960]   >> No.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:27.960]   >> People are scalping C9 twice.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.960]   >> Luckily, I have hundreds of dollars.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.960]   >> I found one in my drawer.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.440]   By the way, it looks like my video is back up now.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.440]   >> It is.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.440]   And you look crystal clear.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.440]   >> Yeah, it looks great.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.440]   >> Whatever was going on, your wife stopped watching those videos.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.440]   >> He stopped the video.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.440]   We can read your wall.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.440]   We can read your book titles.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.440]   >> Oh, man, the details.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.440]   It's incredible.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.440]   >> No, I wonder about that, too.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.560]   >> Luckily, I don't think I've got my book that I would be embarrassed by back there.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:55.800]   >> I make a kind of a hobby of reading people's bookshelves in the background.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.400]   I think you can tell a lot about a person by the bookshelves you can see in the back.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.720]   >> What does it mean you have no books?
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:02.720]   Like me?
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.280]   >> Well, you're probably kindle.
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.920]   >> You have a clean mind, Rich.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.920]   >> I did.
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:10.760]   I got rid of all my books a couple of years ago, and I went to just kindle.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.760]   >> Wow.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:12.760]   >> It was like so sad to throw everything away.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:13.760]   >> I love having books.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.600]   >> I could walk into your house and not have any idea what your politics and cultural interests
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.600]   are.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.040]   Where I walk into Leo's house, I could probably figure out everything.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.040]   >> Oh, he's totally.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.680]   >> Larry, that's been my entire life of being on TV, is making sure that nobody knows what
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]   he knows.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.640]   >> You know what they call that?
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.640]   The Vanuite effect.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.640]   People ascribe their political views to Vanuite because she never says anything.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.440]   >> You mean Vanuite is a lefty?
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.440]   >> She is.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.440]   >> I had no idea.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.960]   >> All right, we're going to take a little break.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.840]   It's time for videos.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:51.040]   We had a fun week on Twitch, and we made a little entertaining video for you celebrating
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.160]   some of the things that happened to watch.
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.080]   >> Previously on Twitch.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:02.520]   >> Dumb then he said, if this is an Apple computer, how come it doesn't have blank lorry said?
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.520]   >> A stem.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.520]   >> He said.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520]   >> Yeah, I feel slightly ashamed.
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:07.520]   >> Oh, no.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.520]   >> You're not wrong.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:12.000]   >> A single mouse button.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   Hands-on wellness.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.960]   >> These little things here have so many germs all over them.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:23.600]   I have two options today that may help you out with cleanliness of your mobile devices.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:24.600]   >> This week in Google.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.600]   >> How did you get those Pixel Buds so fast?
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.600]   >> Feel good, they fit well, they sound good.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.320]   Go outside, start walking, for some strange reason.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.840]   The sound will cut out.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.360]   >> 126 people on Reddit complaining of the same problem.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.960]   >> This week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.960]   >> This from exists when anytime you recycle your hardware, you don't click on it.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:46.720]   Clear it off before selling it, you're going to actually leak some data eventually.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.560]   The researcher went and acquired 13 Tesla media control units.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:53.960]   Each one of the devices stored a trove, a treasure trove of sensitive information, despite
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.960]   being retired.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:57.280]   >> iOS today.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:02.640]   >> This app is called Hear Kitty and you take your phone and you put the phone upside
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.200]   down somewhere hidden in your house.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.200]   >> Hear Kitty.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.200]   >> Oh my God.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.200]   >> What?
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.200]   >> I found Kitty.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.200]   >> It's one of the second.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:15.200]   >> Oh, that's going to drive Lisa crazy.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.200]   >> Thank you.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.000]   >> It's time to see Leo in the cat suit.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000]   >> Thank you, Jim Cutler.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.280]   Not going to have Jim know about the cat suit.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.240]   Who told him about the cat suit?
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.960]   Oh, man, I showed -- oh, good.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:31.760]   I showed it they brought to you by my mattress.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.320]   I feel good today.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.680]   On Wednesday, I was a little out of sorts.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.120]   It was the end of the world as we know it.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.480]   And I realized I just needed a good night's sleep.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.680]   I go to bed on that mass, that beautiful Casper mattress.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.040]   Everything seems just a little bit better.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.960]   A good night's sleep is the best thing in the world.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:53.720]   And if you're sleeping on an old buckling, bad old mattress, it's time to get yourself
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.240]   a Casper.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.000]   Casper reinvented the mattress business.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.040]   They were the ones who did this by eliminating the mattress store.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:06.560]   They go direct to you an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.560]   cost.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.080]   They come in a surprisingly compact box.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.960]   Direct to you, you open it up.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.960]   This was a king.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.920]   I mean, that thing was a small box.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.480]   You open it up.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.480]   It smells great.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.480]   You don't need to air it out.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:24.080]   And suddenly you've got an amazing mattress.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.080]   But here's the best part.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.320]   Yeah, you don't have a mattress store, so there's no way to try before you buy.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.240]   You got 100 nights to try that Casper mattress.
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:34.440]   If at any time in the first 100 nights, you decide it's not for you.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.440]   They'll come.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.040]   They'll take it away.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.880]   You don't have to get it back in the box.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.720]   And they'll refund you every penny.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.520]   Doesn't that look so comfortable?
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:44.520]   Let's get the kitty.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:45.520]   Here, kitty.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.680]   Here, kitty.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.720]   Come on, kitty.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:51.800]   Aw, you spent a third of your life sleeping.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.960]   So you should be comfortable.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:57.880]   The original Casper mattress, that was the first one we had, combines multiple supportive
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:02.160]   memory phones for a quality sleep surface with just the right amount of sink and bounce.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.160]   It's weird.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.400]   It both supports you and lets you sink into it.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.280]   It's very comfortable and that breathable design helps you sleep cool, regulates your
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.280]   body's temperature throughout the night.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:18.600]   With over 20,000 reviews, an average of 4.8 stars across Casper Amazon and Google, it's
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.600]   becoming the internet's favorite mattress.
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:21.600]   I'm not surprised.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:26.480]   They also offer the wave, featuring a patent-padded premium support system to mirror the natural
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.480]   shape of your body.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.960]   The essential, which is great for students.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:35.000]   We sent one to Henry when he went off to college, a streamlined design and a price that won't
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.200]   keep you up at night.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.600]   That one I was lying on, that's the brand new one, that's the hybrid.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.960]   I love this.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.880]   It combines the pressure relief of the award-winning foam with durable yet gentle springs.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.800]   It's the first Casper mattress to have springs.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.440]   I like it because it gives me firm edge support so I don't roll out.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.480]   I mean literally roll out of bed in the morning.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.680]   I love my Casper pillow.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.560]   The sheets, even the glow lamp, Casper is the best.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:04.200]   With that 100 night risk-free trial, why not?
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:07.720]   Casper offers free shipping and painless returns in the US and Canada.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:12.600]   If you're having a hard time sleeping these days and we all are, at least make sure your
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.800]   mattress is comfortable.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.200]   Get a Casper mattress today.

[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.000]   Yes, it's safe for cat claws.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.880]   We sleep with our two cats every night on our Casper.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.240]   All right.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:53.040]   The biggest probably tech story of the week was Apple sneaking out a new 13-inch MacBook
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.040]   Pro.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.840]   We didn't even mention that all through the show.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.720]   I don't know if you guys are Mac users, if you care, if you're excited.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.200]   Anything to say, Rich, you're nodding.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.200]   You like it?
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.200]   Yes, no.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:10.280]   I bought the 16-inch MacBook Pro because I had the 13-inch that I bought before with
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.800]   the scissor keys or whatever they call them and it was terrible.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:14.800]   The butterfly.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.800]   It was so bad.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.800]   I mean, just a butterfly.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.560]   These are the scissors.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.560]   The scissors are bad.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.560]   These are the scissors.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:26.880]   Give me the scissor any day because this is like, I mean, this actually feels like I can
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:30.360]   actually type again and the old computer just doesn't.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.440]   I'm glad the 13-inch folks now have a reasonable keyboard.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.480]   I wonder if this is the end of that butterfly keyboard.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:41.400]   I think it is because they came out with the 16 and now.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:45.440]   Then the MacBook Air, which I bought, which came out a couple of months ago.
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.200]   Now this one, I have a feeling they're not making anymore.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:49.440]   Butterfly laptops.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.440]   Thank God.
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.080]   I think that's it.
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.000]   Here's the thing about Apple that's so frustrating.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.600]   Do you remember when the butterfly keyboard came out?
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:03.120]   They said it was like the best thing and the new, it was like, it's like, and now it's
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.120]   gone for years.
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.120]   And they never said anything.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.000]   I never said, oh, I'm sorry, you're right.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.320]   That wasn't the best thing.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:12.000]   You know, the irony of this is it's still not a great keyboard.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000]   There are better, much better keyboard.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   Absolutely.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   Absolutely.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000]   But it's just no longer unacceptably bad.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.880]   They said such a low bar that we're all going, oh, I can almost type on this.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.360]   It's like the keyboard was pushed down.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.360]   The old let's go down.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.320]   I've bought probably four MacBook Airs over the past whatever number of years.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:38.520]   And then one day, you look Packard sent me a, I don't know what it was, a specter, or
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.200]   maybe they were on a leak book to try out.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.200]   And I loved it.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.720]   And I realized that I was living in this Apple universe that I didn't need better.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:46.720]   Yes.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.720]   Yes.
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.560]   And, you know, I, so I've kind of switched to the HP.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.720]   I'm pretty happy with it.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:51.720]   I use it Dell.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:55.640]   I mean, I have, of course, we have to use both for the shows, but I do too.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:59.840]   I have a Dell XPS 13, the brand new 2020.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:04.600]   Its keyboard is a hundred times better than the MacBook Pro or the 16 inch.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.480]   I haven't tried the new 13.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.400]   It's just, it's, it's usable.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.400]   It's got travel.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.400]   It's soft.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.480]   It's still thin and light.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.440]   It hasn't impacted the thickness of the thing.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:17.240]   I'm not sure you see my screen, but try doing this with an app MacBook.
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240]   You can do it once.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240]   That's it.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.760]   You went all the way around.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.760]   That's the two and one.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:23.760]   Apple doesn't make it two and one.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:24.760]   They don't make it two and one.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.880]   I don't know why they don't make it touch screen.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.080]   I don't understand that unless it's, they don't make it.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.080]   Oh my God.
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:35.560]   My kids, by the way, being home with kids has really, I've gotten a thousand and one
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:40.520]   new perspectives on technology because number one, voices everything to them.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.840]   They use voice for every single interaction.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.240]   Number two, it's all touch.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.960]   So my kids, they come up to my computer.
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.920]   They touch the screen because they think it's all touch.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.720]   Why doesn't your screen work?
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.720]   It doesn't work.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:53.720]   Yes.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.240]   They sit there and they say, "Why isn't your screen have touch?"
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.840]   And I'm like, "That's a great question because we're also used to it now."
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:05.400]   And on the computers that the Microsoft one, my kid has the Surface one and that does have
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.400]   touch.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.760]   And my kid thinks that's a better computer because it has the touch.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:12.200]   Actually, that's another story this week.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.120]   Microsoft came out with new Surfi.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.120]   Surfacy.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.520]   I don't know what surfaces.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:21.920]   I mean, there's not a huge story there.
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:22.920]   They're updated.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.800]   They have a new Surface Book.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.560]   They have a new Surface Go.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.240]   Surface Book Go was the little one that couldn't.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:34.080]   It was a little computer that couldn't.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.440]   Now it almost can.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.600]   It's a little bit faster.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:42.920]   What the most interesting story, Microsoft story of the week actually is the revelation
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:49.920]   that Microsoft Windows 10X is going to emerge on single screen devices.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:54.000]   Now you have to be a Microsoft watcher to understand why that's interesting at all.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.160]   Microsoft is recreating Windows 10 in a, I think it's going to be a more robust kind
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.280]   of containerized operating system.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.680]   So applications will all be isolated.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.680]   They'll be more secure.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.040]   It'll be less prone to crashing.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.520]   But it's such a new way of doing things.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.080]   There'll be a lot of compatibility issues at first.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:19.840]   When Microsoft announced Windows 10X, they said, "It's going to be for dual screen devices.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.920]   And the first one of those is the Windows.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:23.920]   Is it the Neo?
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:25.920]   I think it's the, I could confuse the Duo and the Neo.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.800]   It's like the Duo and the Duo is Android and the Neo I think is Windows.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.800]   Now they're saying, "No, no, no.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.280]   We're not going to wait for the Neo for a couple of reasons because of COVID.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:37.800]   I don't think the Neo is going to come out this year."
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:43.480]   I think they need to hustle along with Windows 10X because Windows 10 is really starting
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.480]   to show its age.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.920]   It's getting a little creaky and unreliable.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.160]   And they're trying, I mean, they tried with the Windows S. That's like the one where you
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.480]   can't really install other apps, right?
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.640]   But this is kind of like from the ground up built that way, which, you know, as long
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.840]   as they have support from like the spotifies of the world and all these man, you know,
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:07.200]   all these app makers that want to get their app on that platform, it's not a bad idea.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.640]   I think it's the future of Windows, to be honest.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:14.960]   But it's going to be a little bit of a bumpy road as always when you make a big change
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.960]   like this.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:16.960]   Yes.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.000]   Microsoft has a way of making changes that are annoying as heck.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.920]   My latest pet peeve, I've started to use Microsoft Photos to do video, I think, because
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:27.360]   it actually does a really good job.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.120]   But I can't figure out how to use it.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:35.520]   There are no menus and there are the, I cannot, in fact, the other day I figured out how to
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.760]   import a video and then I forgot.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:42.400]   And I tried, you know, figuring it out again, but it's impossible because there's nothing
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.640]   intuitive about it.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:48.640]   This is my complaint about the iPad as well, which is there's no UI.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:53.560]   Everybody who makes the app has to make up a UI and there's no, and there's no.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:55.080]   There's no real rhyme or reason.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.320]   Yeah, there's no rhyme or reason.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.320]   No rhyme or reason.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:00.480]   Bill Gates and Steve Jobs got it right back in the, what are the early 90s or 80s when
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:05.760]   they developed Mac OS and Windows with it with a file menu and all the menus.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:12.040]   And it made sense and Apple, and Apple still has it, but Microsoft has dropped it on their
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:13.040]   own apps.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.040]   And it just drives me next.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.720]   I mean, it's the clean.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:21.160]   It's the, yeah, I mean, my eight year old is not asking me for the menu bar.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.160]   I'll tell you that.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.160]   We're able to probably smarter than I am.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.600]   But it's, well, but yeah.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:30.600]   And then so do you think that eight year olds are able to just intuit how to use an iPad
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:35.160]   app and then I think the idea is that your app is so simple.
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.400]   Like if you look at something like Snapchat, when I first tried that, you know, if you
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.000]   think about it, it was so complicated to me because, but at the end of the day, I realized
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.400]   it was kind of a cross, right?
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.040]   You would swipe up for one menu at the bottom.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.000]   You had to figure that out.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000]   You had to figure it out.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000]   Right.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.440]   And what, but after you did to people that use Snapchat, it makes so much sense.
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.040]   And even on Instagram to a small degree and TikTok, especially is the same thing.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.760]   It's like it's all kind of like swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:01.760]   Maybe I'm an old guy.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.760]   You're eight year old.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.760]   You teach me how to use photos.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.760]   People keep for a gig.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:05.760]   I feel like this.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.400]   Maybe I've been around too long, but this goes contrary, in my opinion, the way software
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:17.040]   should be designed where all the affordances are discoverable and there are clues, there
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.840]   are tips for the UI.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.160]   But the only way you could figure out Snapchat, and I bet Microsoft photos is by just going,
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.800]   well, let's see, does this do anything?
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.800]   Does this do anything?
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:27.800]   Does that do anything?
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.800]   Does this?
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.800]   That seems dopey to do that.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.400]   But when you're doing video editing, there's a lot of things you need to do.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:37.080]   There's some of them are obvious, but some of them are really virtually impossible.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.040]   And I've stumbled on a few things.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.360]   And some YouTube videos explain it.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:45.800]   But I think what they do is they test these things on complete novices that I've never
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:49.840]   used a computer before, and they probably do better on them than they get you a more
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.840]   traditional program.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.280]   It doesn't make sense to them anyway.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:57.440]   How would you ever discover the three finger swipe on the iPad or whatever?
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.440]   You can't discover that.
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:02.200]   I mean, the only time you discover is if you do it by mistake and all of a sudden your
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:06.400]   whole screen changes, like the zoom thing, a lot of times people not zoom the video
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.440]   conference, but like assistive touch or whatever it is, like the zoom people zoom in their
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:11.840]   phone and they can't zoom out.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.080]   And they're like, what's going on here?
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.080]   They just like did like a four-star thing.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.560]   Roland has a good insight.
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:19.160]   He says toddlers and young children are hardwired for surprise.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:20.760]   They know nothing.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:25.560]   So new and novel things are what they expect.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.760]   So it is a great just going, yeah, I don't know how to use this.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.760]   I don't know how to use anything.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:35.960]   There's a story and I don't know if it's apocryphal or not, but it's instructive about
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:40.680]   the 10-year-old girl who hacked her zoom.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:45.360]   So with the fake background, it made it look like and with a video running or something
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.800]   that made it look like she was interested in the class, while she went outside and played
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:49.800]   with the dog.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:54.600]   In the meantime, the mother was worried that she would not know how to use zoom.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.200]   So she knew how to use zoom.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.240]   So you figured it out.
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.240]   It's a brave new world.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.240]   And speaking of-
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.840]   I will just add one thing real quick about Microsoft stuff.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.760]   I just want to say I tried on their headphones back at the event and I think it was like
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.760]   October.
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.480]   Yeah, the new Surface Buds came out today and the Surface Pro, yeah.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.640]   And they look so weird, but the Surface Buds actually, out of all the ones I tried on,
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:24.040]   the Pixel Buds, the, I, you know, whatever, these are the AirPods, they actually were
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.640]   the most comfortable and lightweight in my ears.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:29.960]   Like they felt like they could be in my ear for the longest out of any of them.
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:30.960]   Oh, interesting.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.520]   There's nothing weirder looking to me than the original AirPod or whatever it's called.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:37.520]   We all got used to that, didn't we?
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.920]   It looks like you had a cigarette in your ear to me.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.200]   It was the worst look ever.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.360]   We all mocked it.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.760]   And now everybody's, do you see it on TV?
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.400]   Everybody's got it all the time.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.400]   Right?
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.400]   Everybody is on the news shows as well.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.400]   Free advertising for Apple.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.400]   Oh, man.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.840]   Or actually they probably supplied them all now that I think about it.
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.840]   Probably.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:54.840]   Did they?
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:55.840]   I don't think they, I think you don't even have to.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:58.440]   I think on some of them it says at the end, like commercial consideration.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.440]   What are you wearing?
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.680]   What are you wearing right now there, Rich D'Amour?
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:07.280]   This is, I'll be honest, I'm wearing my AirPods because I saw people on network TV wearing
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.280]   them.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:11.040]   I said, "I could wear them on, you know, Zoom calls."
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.320]   It's good enough for Zoom calls.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.440]   It's good enough for me.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:15.280]   And actually, and the audio isn't bad.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:17.040]   It's not as bad as you would expect.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:20.640]   I know you've got a real microphone, Rich, but you could be using the audio on your other
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.640]   foot.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:23.640]   Yes.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.640]   And a lot of network people are.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:27.320]   They seal out your ear more so than like what you're wearing, Larry.
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:29.640]   Like the standard ones.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:30.640]   Those don't seal out your ear.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.640]   These do, which is a little off-putting.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.160]   Earlier I showed you these are the new Google ones.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:39.360]   And they, you know, I like them better visually because they don't stick out as much.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.840]   But that, now they have a big circular dot on them.
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:47.240]   But, Rich, when you tried the Microsoft ones, those are really big because they're a swipe
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.240]   surface.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:51.680]   It looks like you've got, you know, those, the kids get gauges in their ears and they
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:53.520]   make their earlobes bigger and big.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.760]   It looks like you're like a beginner age.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.400]   Like, oh, right?
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:59.360]   It's like you walk down the street.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.360]   People aren't going to mess with you.
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.640]   They're like, oh, that guy's got a gauge.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.640]   I'm not messing with him.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:05.840]   He's one of them new primitives I hear about, honey.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.200]   Stand across the street.
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.800]   Pixel buds are swipeable as well.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.400]   You can do a lot of things by swipey.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:14.400]   The Pixel Buds, they have a little air chamber in them that actually relieves kind of that
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.040]   tension that you feel in your ear.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:21.360]   So I was not on the Google nice list apparently because everyone got to prepare these except
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:22.360]   for me.
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.000]   I can't tell you.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.520]   My problem is they don't stay and they keep falling out of my ear if that's my problem.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.520]   So here's an I know you're posting.
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.440]   Here's a young woman with the new Surface earbuds.
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.440]   She looks good.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.520]   Yeah, it looks like jewelry on her, doesn't it?
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.520]   Doesn't look that way on me.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:37.520]   You know what?
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:38.520]   I was with my man.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:39.520]   They were comfortable.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:41.160]   They look weird, but they are comfortable.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:44.920]   So I'll be curious to see what the uptake is on those.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:49.720]   I have to say, I feel like it's a conspiracy because all these companies, Google got rid
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:50.720]   of their head.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.200]   First Apple got rid of their headphone jack.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:53.480]   They showed the courage to do that.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.800]   Then Google followed suit with the Pixel.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.200]   They got rid of their headphone jack.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.560]   Samsung even now doesn't have a headphone jack.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.320]   I feel like it's a conspiracy to get us to buy much more expensive, lower quality Bluetooth
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:09.640]   headphones and you can get a USB headset.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.120]   I mean, those are available.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.120]   You have to use the connector.
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.120]   You can't walk around anymore.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.120]   No, no, no, you get a USB-C.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.120]   Google simple one.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:18.120]   Ugh.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.120]   They're cheap.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.120]   Do they ship one in the box?
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:21.680]   I don't think they'll do anymore.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.920]   It's one of these things where the price of the phone has gone up.
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.520]   But it's kind of like the surface thing.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.360]   Actually, this is a problem I have with the surface.
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.360]   If you look at the commercials for the surfaces, Surf Eye, whatever, they always show the keyboard
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.680]   case and the pen.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.680]   As if you get that.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:38.680]   Exactly.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:39.680]   No.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.680]   And you don't get that.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:41.680]   That's an extra 250.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:42.680]   Oh, man.
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:49.040]   So that $3.99 for the surface go, you don't get that pen, that mouse, that keyboard.
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.040]   No, no, no, no.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.880]   Those accessories are not included, buddy.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.240]   Even when you buy cereal and they show you blueberries, they disclose that the blueberries
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:59.080]   don't come with a suggestion.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.080]   It's a serving suggestion.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.080]   They should put it on there.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.880]   Cereal boxes used to come with a prize in them when I was a kid.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:05.880]   Not you.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.640]   In my day, cereal boxes would come with rocks in them.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.600]   So you could...
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:14.520]   Here talk about, I got to give a trigger warning here.
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:19.880]   If you're worried about our dystopian future, do not watch this next video.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:30.040]   This is the Dynamics Robot Spot patrolling a park in Hong Kong to warn people to preserve
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.040]   social distancing.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.800]   I don't know how widespread this is in Hong Kong.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:36.800]   Spot will continue to...
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.800]   Singapore, I believe.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.800]   Oh, it's, I say Hong Kong.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:39.800]   I'm in Singapore.
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.800]   You're right.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:41.800]   It's in the straits.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:46.280]   It is going to be in parks and nature reserves managed by the National Parks Board.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:50.240]   Keep up your sound too because it's great to hear this thing coming.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.920]   Watch how people react as this robotic dog creeps up on them.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:55.920]   Oh my God.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.920]   Creep is the right word.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920]   It is creepy.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.920]   Oh my God.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.920]   Oh my God.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:00.920]   Run.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.920]   There comes a dog.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.920]   Get out of there.
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:05.080]   You think COVID is dangerous.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.400]   Well if a dog came up to me and said separate, separate, I would.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.120]   This is, this is Robocop.
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:10.960]   This is terrifying.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:14.360]   You know, that thing could be weaponized too.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:18.720]   If it kicks you, can you imagine?
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:23.160]   Although, Stephanie, I did see somebody in the YouTube comments say, you know, you did
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.160]   that in America.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:27.600]   It would for sure be kicked over within five minutes.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:28.600]   Oh, yes.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:29.600]   That's the favorite.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:30.600]   That thing's terminal.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.600]   People in Singapore are very well behaved.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:36.000]   It might be attacked by like a pack of real dogs.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000]   Get out of here.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.320]   It's not turf.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:43.880]   I also wanted to mention that the BBC has made available Zoom backgrounds.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:49.520]   If you're unhappy with your existing Zoom backgrounds, you can now be living in a TARDIS.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:52.400]   Actually, they also have class.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.720]   I should show you the, the classy house.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:56.520]   They have the, oh, you got to see this.
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.760]   Let me go to the BBC site for this.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:01.680]   Here is a BBC sitcom.
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:05.000]   That looks like my office.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.040]   Hancock's half hour to, I know, look at these.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.200]   They have black and white ones.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.920]   This is, they are.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:15.160]   You could be, if your house isn't messy enough.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:19.200]   I'm really tempted to use this.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:24.600]   Whether that stack of hulaoobs, orange crates, what the hell is going on in this one?
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:25.600]   I don't know.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.440]   Isn't that great though?
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:29.680]   See, I want to go the opposite direction.
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:31.240]   Rich says I've got a nice, tidy house.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:34.240]   I want to have this in the background.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.640]   I think anyway, those are all available for free from the BBC.co.gov.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:41.240]   You get a bit of adult protective services.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:43.240]   Yeah, really.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.480]   As we got a report, you're growing something in the background area.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:56.360]   And finally, let's see, I wanted to mention, oh, I was, I wanted to end on an up note.
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:01.000]   Let me see if I could find the other final story.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000]   Final story.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000]   No, it's not TikTok stars who are struggling to make money.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.880]   Oh, I love that story.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:07.880]   Really?
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:09.880]   You want to do that?
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:10.880]   It's so sad.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.360]   It's like, it's like you're, you're literally working at Burger King, but you have millions
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:16.040]   of fans on TikTok.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.760]   I mean, it's the irony of our life right now.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:20.560]   It's the world we live in.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.200]   There's no way to monetize.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.600]   It was this, this hazmat inspired suit lets you dance, drink and vape while you're staying
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:31.680]   safe from the virus in clubs.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.960]   It has an N95 filter battery powered suit controlled by a smartphone.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.400]   I sure would like to get this.
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.200]   We need to die from vaping.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.960]   This is an LA company that created this and I actually told my producer, we need to figure
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.640]   out if this is just a, like literally just a computer generated thing or if they actually
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.640]   made one because I want to put this thing on.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:55.480]   They call this the micro shell from production.club.
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:58.360]   I feel like it's made up, don't you?
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.800]   But I would, I would wear this.
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:01.640]   I would wear this everywhere.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.600]   I would be known as the micro shell guy.
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:04.600]   I'll do it for you.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.520]   I'll wear it on all the shows.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.280]   That has to cost a lot.
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.440]   Vape pen not included.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:14.120]   It's got an orange vape through a screen.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:18.480]   You probably have the vape inside with you.
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:20.240]   Oh gosh.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:23.240]   Filter there.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:26.080]   Sign up for updates.
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:28.640]   Rich would you let me know if you get this thing?
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:29.960]   I want one too.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:33.680]   It looks like something that was 100% created inside a computer screen and they're going
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:34.680]   to get publicity.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:36.680]   Exactly.
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.520]   Now if you want to look up, look up, what is it?
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:41.440]   Under the weather, the umbrella pod, I think it is.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:47.640]   And this, this company is pivoting to, they made like umbrellas that you put on like a
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.160]   pod, like a rain pod that you put over yourself.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:54.640]   And now they're pivoting to selling these things as like protective, you know, like, hey,
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:55.840]   you want to be in your own little pod.
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:59.640]   This is the same thing the guy who cuts your hair had.
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:00.640]   This is.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.640]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.640]   There it is.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:05.280]   This is exactly what he was doing.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.760]   He was wearing an umbrella pod with armholes cut into it.
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:10.520]   And I think this is it.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.520]   Look at that.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:14.160]   Oh, where can I get these?
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.360]   They were on Shark Tank.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.000]   I want that's you, Rich tomorrow.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000]   That's me.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000]   Yes.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000]   Wearing an umbrella pod.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000]   This is Leo.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.680]   I've been covering tech news for 15 years.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:28.160]   I recorded this video out in the rain and it went viral like nothing I've ever done in
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.160]   my life.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:30.160]   Maybe not on YouTube.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.240]   It was on Facebook and Instagram, but I couldn't believe it.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:36.560]   I think it took guts to wear a pink shirt, but it turns out it works perfectly with the
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.840]   baby blue under the weather.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:43.160]   See, you don't look at all dorky.
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.640]   So have you used this?
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:47.040]   Do you have you used this?
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.600]   I mean, the saddest part, the saddest part of this whole story to end cap.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.800]   But I think this did two million views on Facebook.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.800]   Wow.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.960]   And I gave it to Goodwill.
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:57.960]   I like brought it.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:00.080]   It was like one of those things you just dump out of the back of your car to like, because
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:06.240]   this was February of last year when nobody knew that they were going to want to wear
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.240]   this all the time.
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.240]   Nobody knew.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:17.640]   Rich, how could you not see the great potential in the walking pod from under the weather?
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.560]   Ladies and gentlemen, that's Rich tomorrow.
[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.800]   You see him on KTLA.
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:25.200]   If you see him walking around in one of these suits, it's okay not to cross the street.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.200]   He's safe.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.160]   Rich, thank you so much for being here.
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:29.160]   I really appreciate it.
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:32.880]   Rich on TEC.tv at Rich DeMuro.
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.600]   Actually it's Rich on TEC on Twitter too these days on Instagram, on Facebook.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.600]   He's the man to follow.
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.600]   It's always great to see you, Rich.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.480]   Thank you so much.
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:42.480]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:43.320]   I really appreciate it.
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:45.360]   Thank you also to Larry Magad.
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:49.360]   He is CBS News Radio's Larry Magad.
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:52.200]   Connects safely.org.
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:54.320]   Now that I'm back on Facebook, I follow you.
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:56.360]   And by the way, you posed a question on Facebook.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.920]   I wanted to answer.
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:04.200]   You mentioned that there was potentially a Corona cluster at CES.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:05.200]   Yes.
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.400]   And I saw you at CES my last day there.
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:14.000]   You tagged everybody who you'd met at CES saying, "Are you okay?"
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.840]   I never got a coronavirus and I did get an antibody test.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:21.080]   One of the ones offered by a request and I'm negative.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:22.080]   Okay.
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:26.840]   I haven't been tested, but I had a wicked flu right after CES and I had taken the flu
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:27.840]   shot.
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:28.840]   My kids got it.
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:30.480]   I don't know.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:34.760]   And we do know now that the first to death, I think in California, certainly the first
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:39.240]   death in Santa Clara County was somebody who had been to CES.
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:42.400]   So it's not out of the question that one could--
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.400]   That was a vector.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:46.400]   And I'm not saying that I got it.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:47.400]   I don't know if I got it.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:51.280]   I'm fine now, but I did go through a pretty nasty flu-like situation in mid-January.
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:53.920]   Yeah, Lisa was really sick too.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:55.640]   And that's why we wanted to go get the test.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:56.640]   She was negative.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:57.640]   Good idea.
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:58.640]   There's the flu still, right?
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:02.920]   So I talked about it with my doctor and he said, "So if you are positive, what's going
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:03.920]   to happen?"
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.920]   I said, "Nothing because we don't know if I have immunity."
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:06.920]   Right.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:07.920]   He said, "Then don't bother taking."
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.760]   So he's not going to write me a prescription because there's nothing we would--
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:14.400]   You can do it without a prescription at Quest Labs all over the question.
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.200]   But then you have to expose yourself to Quest Labs.
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:23.200]   Well, it was very dystopian because they spread the appointments out.
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:27.360]   My son came right after me, but they spread it out in such a way that you never see anybody.
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.720]   You arrive at the lab.
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:32.640]   The waiting room is empty.
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.160]   There's a-- nobody at the desk.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.160]   There's a kiosk.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:36.920]   You scan your thing.
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:39.600]   You sit down, although I wasn't going to sit down.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:43.200]   They told me later, "Oh no, we disinfect after each client."
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:46.760]   Somebody in the back goes, "Leo, you go in the back.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:49.960]   She's dressed in one of those things that Rich was just wearing."
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:50.960]   Right.
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:53.560]   And she takes your blood and then you leave.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:54.560]   So I feel like it's fairly--
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:55.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:56.560]   It's also a guy.
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:59.360]   There's also a company that will come out to your house.
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:00.800]   They said they would come to my driveway.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.120]   Actually, Marissa Meyer sent me a note to tell me about that.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:05.120]   And then the problem with Quest Labs--
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:06.120]   Wow.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:07.120]   There's a-- there's a--
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:08.120]   Yeah, and drop.
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:09.120]   It's a clever idea.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:12.760]   Yeah, no, she had her-- I guess she-- I don't know how-- I have to ask her how it came out,
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:15.000]   but she had her family tested.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000]   It's not cheap.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000]   I mean, it's like 150 bucks for them to come.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.800]   Well, the Quest is $100 every year.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:22.200]   Oh, the Quest is $130 and you go to them.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.200]   You go to them.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:25.200]   So we'll see.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.560]   That's the new thing is everybody said, oh, yeah, I had it.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.920]   I remember I was really sick in December or January.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:30.920]   Right?
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.760]   The New York Times had a story basically saying a lot of people think they had it.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.760]   And I don't know if I had it.
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:35.760]   I just know that I had it.
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.080]   Steve gives the things as he had it.
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.440]   My son, who had a legitimate story because he had been in Vietnam and Bali, we finally
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:46.680]   forced him to come home end of March.
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:50.960]   He quarantined, self-quarantined after he got home about seven days into the quarantine,
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:52.720]   he was sick.
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:54.320]   And we thought, oh, you must have had COVID.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:55.320]   Because how else were you?
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:56.520]   He tested negative too.
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:57.520]   So that's good.
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:56:59.520]   Well, is it?
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.800]   Well, that kind of wish if I could have had it.
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.720]   Yeah, I would have had it.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:06.120]   But I'm hoping I never did it.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:09.640]   Best case scenario is you didn't know you had it and you had it.
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:10.640]   Right.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.640]   Exactly.
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.480]   But all I know is that at some point, a lot of people are going to have it.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:21.440]   And some of us on this show, not all of us are over 60 and technically that high risk.
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:22.440]   Rich?
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:23.440]   You're the guy.
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:25.440]   You're the guy after this.
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.440]   You're the community.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.440]   We're all gone.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:34.360]   I anyway, so I thought I would bring that up, Larry, because I knew you were curious
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.360]   about that.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.800]   And we really did dodge a bullet.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:44.160]   Had this hit a month earlier, maybe CES could have been the cluster to beat all clusters.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:46.400]   It could have been a really a mess.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:47.400]   Absolutely.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:48.400]   I don't.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:49.400]   It's not.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:52.200]   It doesn't look like it was the thousands of people came home with COVID.
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:54.880]   But I have a feeling there will be no CES 2021.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:55.880]   I could be willing.
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:58.360]   I'm never going to CES again.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.960]   Everybody always gets sick at CES.
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:02.960]   What were we thinking?
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.960]   Right?
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:06.680]   Everyone gets sick in a healthy year.
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:13.760]   So it's like, yeah, I'll be honest, I love CES, but I will enjoy the year off from CES.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:15.360]   I will be just fine.
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:17.360]   And also, thank you.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:18.440]   Anyway, catch Larry.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:22.440]   It's safely.org.
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:25.160]   You'll hear them on CBS all over the country.
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:26.160]   It's always great to see.
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.880]   I had three radio guys on with me.
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:29.320]   This was the radio guy show.
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:30.320]   You sound good.
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:31.320]   That's awesome.
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:33.680]   Because I didn't and Rich him and that look good, but we found him.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:34.680]   You look okay.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:35.680]   Well, that's the beauty of radio.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:36.880]   You could sound good.
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:41.600]   And then people meet you and go, oh, that's what you look like.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:43.440]   Oh, hi.
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:47.600]   Doc Serals, it's so great to have you as part of our--
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:48.600]   It's great to be here.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:49.600]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:54.400]   You and your A, a Kai for quad, four channel tasting.
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:55.840]   It's on that side.
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:58.080]   And this is a stack of Linux journals over on the other side.
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.080]   Even better.
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.080]   Wow, look at that.
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:02.640]   So is this going to be where you're going to do the show from on Wednesday?
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:03.640]   Yeah, I like here.
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:05.920]   I've had two new lights up here.
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:06.920]   It looks great.
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:07.920]   But I do it up to you better than that.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:08.920]   And I like to find the greenery.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:09.920]   I really like it.
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:10.920]   It's really good.
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:12.920]   And you look like Edward R. Murrow with that mic.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:16.800]   I just want you to cup your ear from now on when you get it up.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.560]   Doc, it's great to have you serals.com@docsserals.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.840]   You catch them on a Zoom call.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:26.600]   How many hours a day do you Zoom these days?
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:30.040]   I was about to say most of them, a lot of them.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.040]   I Zoomed three calls.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:32.040]   I didn't read calls.
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:33.040]   Well, you can meet on Friday.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:36.080]   But as you meet with people, you're doing it on Zoom.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:38.080]   I did some of them are on other platforms.
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:40.080]   But Zoom is like doing.
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:41.080]   You know?
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:42.080]   It's like moving a big thing.
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:45.080]   Oh, and I was-- but after three calls and one day I was--
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:47.760]   I thought, I don't understand how people do this.
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:48.760]   It's exhausting.
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:49.760]   It is.
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:52.600]   I thought I had the immunity because I do it all day, every day.
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.200]   I'm getting ice cream because of it.
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:56.680]   Oh, it's terrible.
[01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:58.200]   Anyway, it's great to see all three of you.
[01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:59.520]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:01.440]   Thanks to all of you too.
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:05.560]   We will keep doing Twitter as long as we can.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:09.240]   Struggling along in the new era of COVID.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:11.400]   I'm in an everything home.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:15.600]   Wherever it is, I happen to be except six feet under.
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.440]   I don't think we've figured out a microphone that will work down there.
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:25.120]   But if you want to join us, we do it live every Sunday evening, about 230 Pacific 530 Eastern

[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.400]   They're always there.
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:01.400]   Thank you, chat.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.600]   It's great to have you.

[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:31.400]   Best thing to do though, take your mobile device, put a podcast client on there, overcast,
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:35.600]   pocketcast, Stitcher, Slack or Google's podcasts, Apple's podcast.
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:36.600]   We don't care.
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:37.760]   We're on all of them.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:40.680]   Put a podcast app on there and subscribe that way.
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:41.760]   You don't ever think about it.
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:44.840]   You'll have a copy of Twit available whenever you're in the mood.
