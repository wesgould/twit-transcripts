[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech. Renee Ritchie joins us for Mac Break Weekly. Jason
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.080]   Snell from Six Colors and a new member of the Twit crew. We've got Philip Michaels,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.240]   managing editor of Tom's Guide here. We'll talk about WWDC. Each of them will highlight some of
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.040]   the most important things they thought Apple announced on Monday. One thing they didn't announce,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.040]   new laptops. We'll talk about when they might do that. And then it's the annals of billionaires.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.000]   You won't believe what they're up to next. It's all coming up on a great Twit. Stay here.

[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:53.600]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. The show we cover the week's tech news.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.840]   We have a panel that all knows each other. So that's kind of fun. In fact, what's even more fun is
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   two out of the three year in studio. But let's start with the guy who's stuck in Canada. Renee
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.520]   Richie is here. We miss Jon Tuesday and Mac break weekly. I'm just so jealous that all of you,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.960]   you know, fully vaxxed people get to hang out and meet space again while I'm stuck here behind a
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.920]   closed border with the half-vaxx and no studio space. So nice. But we'll get there.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.080]   Yeah. We'll get there. And we miss Jon Tuesday. I take it because you're getting lots of
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.400]   information from Apple during a dub dub. Days and days and days and days. But you know,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.000]   that's the job, Leo. There's a lot. A lot to talk about from WWDC. So we do have a little bit of
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   an Apple centric panel, including Jason Snell from Six Colors. Oh, no.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.800]   Oh, no. I'm here. I'm getting full studio. I'm keeping you at touching you. It's been like a year
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.840]   and a half since I've been here or something like that. It's good to make a drive. So nice.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.000]   Well, you're just down the road. Yeah. I know. But there was like this invisible barrier
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.200]   preventing your visitation. So we're glad to see you. It's good to be here. Also here,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.040]   managing editor of Tom's Guide. First time on the show, but I'm thrilled to have Philip Michaels
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.280]   here. Hi, Philip. Hi. Thanks for having me. Great to be here. Good to see you. Great. Have we met?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.480]   Once or twice? Okay. We don't talk about that though. All these guys know each other.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.720]   So I'm just going to be sitting here at the Cool Kids table. I'm excited. Very excited.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.800]   Yeah. That's enough. That's enough. That table's over there. Oh, oh, you mean this is the outcast
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.640]   table? The one I usually see that. Yeah. So I'm going to be like Craig FaceTime. Elephant in the
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.120]   room time. Apple. Well, it's funny because John Prosser was absolutely adamant. Apple rumor
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.360]   monker. There will be new Mac laptop on Monday. He's already shaved his eyebrows. I don't know
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.400]   what else he can shave, but love to dream Monday morning before the keynote said no new hardware.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.720]   So it was like a battle of the rumor mills and love to dream one. There was no new hardware. But then
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.000]   something interesting happened. Apple posted the keynote on YouTube and among the tags,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.720]   M1X and MacBook Pro M1X. Are they messing with us? Are they messing with us?
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.280]   They're trolling. So who does those tags? First of all, do we know?
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.080]   Is it some P is it called? Well, it's not it's not JAWS. No, it's not JAWS. We know that for sure.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.640]   Yeah. It's some guy, some P on right. It's someone in the marketing department. Sure.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.240]   Why would they have put those tags in? They must have thought at the time they got a new book on
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.160]   SEO and they're just itching to try it out. Yeah, I think I think it's entirely possible that at
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.800]   some point they thought that those products might ship at WWDC or at least be announced.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.560]   Talking to developers, Pro Max, the developers love, Pro laptops. But not only is it a it would
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.240]   have to be a brand new chip. They've only done the M1 for Apple Silicon. So are they ready for that?
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.680]   And there have been so many supply chain constraints across the whole tech industry.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.960]   And they said specifically that the Mac has been constrained. That like is it surprising that
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.640]   perhaps a lot of companies are not able to ship these products when they want. We will never know
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.560]   probably whether they were really planning it would have been a good time. But I'm not surprised
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.480]   they didn't have it. Stephen Hackett on six colors your blog said 65% he did the math. Very
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.840]   enterprising of him. Yes. 65% of WWDCs have announced new hardware in the last 20 years. And in the
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.720]   last 10 it's about 5050. So it's not the people who say there's never hardware at WWDC. That's not
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.120]   accurate. It's sort of a I'd say these days it's a 5050 shot.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.840]   But what happened? Did somebody I mean it's very puzzling to me because this is a pretty well-run
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.160]   company. Somebody forget to send a memo down to the basement that we did. Well, we didn't.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.600]   Or to John Pachowski, right? So that Buzzfeed could say don't expect any new hardware.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.200]   We didn't release the laptop. So take those tags out or they obviously did the tags before the keynote.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.280]   Sure. Right. So and by the way the last keynote Alex Lindsay who was an eye for this on Mac
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.960]   Break Weekly said there were two jump cut edit points which I think were something that was
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.880]   snipped out that they had it was in and they because they didn't have time to do those fancy
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.320]   transitions they did everywhere else. I didn't I didn't think to look for jump cuts in this
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.400]   keynote. But I think it's credible at this point that they had something in there. Remember this
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.120]   is all pre-recorded and they cut it out. And it was 15 minutes shorter than two hours Leo. That's the
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.640]   other big conspiracy. Oh, go all the way to the end of the hour. And Apple cuts things at the last
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.280]   minute from its keynote all the time. I remember that one Mac rolled expo keynote in New York that
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.880]   I want to say 2002 was one of the last ones there. It felt very brief and it apparently they had
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.840]   cut something at the last second. So I wouldn't be surprised if they were pushing it right to the
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.880]   moment when they thought that they could have the hardware and have a ship date and then just
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.640]   decided now we can't we can't include it. It's very possible. In fact a lot of people predicted that
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.320]   they would announce it and say but you won't be able to order it till August or September.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.880]   Well, I think it would be entirely possible right that they what they want to do is they want to
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.880]   have a limited amount of time before the pre-orders and then a limited amount of time before it ships
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.760]   and they've been playing a little bit more loosely with that and saying okay maybe it's three weeks
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.120]   and maybe it's four weeks after that but they want a timetable and I think if you're Apple and you're
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.840]   looking at even if you're already making them but you're having supply problems and you realize you're
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.560]   never going to be able to fulfill demand. Maybe you just say well let's wait like our developer
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.120]   conference gets enough focus right like literally Apple doesn't need hardware in order to make
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.320]   people pay attention to them and they can always call another event and do another event especially
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.560]   now when they just have to play a video on the internet and that's all they have to do.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   There's almost lends itself to that kind of thing. There was a moment where I think it was Craig
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.520]   Federighi mentioned something and said we'll have more on this later there was this weird like
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   forward promotion of something and I thought at the time oh well that's because there's going to be
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.160]   hardware later and yeah yeah we did too we were sitting there saying oh boy no
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:13.760]   so much expectation old debt. And honestly that's the problem I have because I told a lot of people
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.600]   do not buy anything you know Apple's going to announce something in June.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.840]   We always do that like never buy before an Apple just standing wisdom is no matter what
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   you might want to buy if it's like a couple weeks from an Apple event just on the off chance
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.720]   and especially now to your point they are fine with leading edge silicon because they just bought
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.120]   all of the five nanometer process that that is but the trailing edge silicon all the big stuff
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.280]   like the controller chips and everything that their suppliers are using those are horribly
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.760]   constrained and if you can't get like one old chip to make the whole new laptop work then could
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.880]   just you better all display controller chip yeah or bluetooth or thunderbolt or like what
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.520]   did Tim Cook call them legacy nodes the idea which is a weird term of art that I had not heard before
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.440]   but it's the idea of the nanometer there's old crap that they still put on their computers and
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.760]   that's the stuff that's in short supply the stuff that everybody is using Apple's got it locked down
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.920]   when it's stuff that just Apple is is using so if you if we were able to see the secret top secret
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.720]   Apple roadmap for Apple silicon this would be a lot we'd be dead now we'd be one tattooed on
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.960]   Johnny Saruji's back right be shredded even he can't see it all be locked but but it would be
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.760]   perfectly sensible that this would be the time you'd release those kind of and by the way I like
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.600]   the name M1X that makes a lot of sense that follows the naming convention one year anniversary of the
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.440]   announcement of Apple's Ilchan to be the perfect time to show off something yeah you know big and flashy
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.200]   plus you want to get laptops out right about now people make buying decisions for the fall for
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:45.840]   school right so it wasn't at all a leap to think that Apple might announce them here and it's also
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.280]   because of chip shortages and covid not at all surprising that they couldn't but now what happens
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:57.200]   does this push the whole roadmap back do they announce a lot of stuff in September they're not
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.960]   gonna do I think in July and August right it's that's the dog days of summer you don't announce
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.240]   anything I don't know I could but if they're redesigns they wouldn't like if they're not
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.360]   redesigns Apple just drops Mac whenever they feel like it they've done it in July they've done it in
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.480]   August they've done it in November but these are supposed to be redesigned and they need
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.720]   they want to strut yeah I think they could do August and if they if that's what ends up
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   happening then great or even July but it's more likely that yeah they'll they'll make it into a
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.160]   fall thing and remember how many events they did in the fall last year I mean we could be headed
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.880]   for something like that again yeah so nothing so it's like a Disney plush show probably done for
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.720]   the summer I don't know I mean they if they want to get it out in three weeks they could I mean they
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.520]   could do it at any point I think maybe we overthink this a little bit like literally if Apple gets
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.760]   enough that they can put it on sale and it's brand new MacBook Pros people are gonna love that
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.640]   Apple Silicon MacBook Pros they're gonna be really excited they're gonna sell a bunch of them nobody's
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.360]   buying the existing MacBook Pros now right because everybody who would buy a pro laptop knows what's
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.160]   coming which is Apple Silicon versions of those that's another reason why you're in a hurry is so
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.200]   yeah so on one level you don't want to do the Osborne effect by pre-announcing it but like
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.800]   they kind of did the Osborne effect already by saying they're going to transition away from
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.320]   Intel so at this point you know if you feel confident you could start selling them late July
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.800]   or sometime in August maybe you do I don't know my nephew is a graphic design artist just
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.880]   graduated from the Rhyland School of Design congratulations Will very talented congratulations
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.720]   going to his first internship his first job probably he needs a new laptop he's got the 2015
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:35.280]   MacBook Pro I got him when he went into high school my mom and I were gonna buy him this 16 inch
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:45.760]   his future employer or at least intern guy said oh you really want a Radeon 9500 MX I said no
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:56.240]   you don't because that means you'd be buying the Intel i9 MacBook 16 or do you I think that's
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.240]   dated information is it can we assume that what I'm using right now all right well it's yeah and
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.320]   we have plenty of them I have there's one across the hall I gave mine and my son who's using it for
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:10.640]   video editing for his tiktok's that is right now the fastest MacBook I guess although with Adobe
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.920]   coming out with native m1 software it's the biggest MacBook we could say it's a sickly biggest
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.280]   well the graphics capabilities of the m1x
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.320]   rival that of the discrete graphics of the top of the line MacBook Intel
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:33.200]   well keep in mind we don't actually know what it is right like we don't know exactly what that
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.600]   chip wouldn't apple have to aim for that though yeah I think so I think that they're going to want
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.760]   to have a lot of GPU cores in there and then the question is just how well does apples graphics
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.680]   performance scale when they increase the number of cores right if they go from four to eight or eight
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.840]   to sixteen what does that mean and the rumors are that it could be quite impressive but it's
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.960]   it's their first take on it so we don't really know I know Adobe with the WWDC stuff because
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.600]   they were talking about ray tracing on apple right in general they were talking very philosophically
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.240]   about ray tracing and other high end graphic functions in some of the sessions kind of implying
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.800]   that yeah don't worry you're gonna be covered I mean I don't think they're gonna do an eGPU
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.040]   little right imagine this on twice the course four times the core right imagine you know don't
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:21.120]   think about it too much but imagine yeah so these are this I'm sure apple didn't want to do this but
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.200]   there are as a result of this there's there's a whole bunch of unanswered kind of things floating
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:32.080]   in the air but I think we're gonna have to wait till the fall however I don't want that to over
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.600]   shadow the fact that they announced a lot of really good interesting stuff that was a very jam
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.200]   packed hour and 45 minutes I joked last week we can't even cover or I guess it was on Mac break weekly
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.320]   we can't even cover in our two and a half hour podcast everything apple talked about in our
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:56.640]   45 minutes it was a jam packed episode I a keynote I don't really even know where to start on this
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.680]   so let me do this with each of you I'll start with you Renee what what would they I'll give you two
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.200]   I was gonna say what's the most important thing apple announced but what are the couple of or
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.880]   three if you need to things that apple announced on Monday that you think are important so I mean
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.200]   just personally my favorites are are you know and beyond the accessibility stuff that we saw come
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.720]   out before WWDC but just the privacy stuff the way they continue to push forward
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.680]   much to Facebook chagrin things like divulging all the URLs of every app that's trying to
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.240]   you know hook your data into some other horror source doing things like intermediating email
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:37.040]   intermediating IP addresses all of that I think is as an option you know is absolutely terrific
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.360]   and then I've been a longtime fan of extensibility and continuity I think those came out with iOS 8
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.120]   and those we're think one of those transformative things that apple has done in terms of mobile
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.920]   software and just to see them continue to push the possibilities like the interface possibilities
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.040]   of continuity with things like universal control I thought I think that's terrific and the more
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.880]   stuff they can do like that the more value they just bring to people who do have multiple parts of
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.680]   the apple ecosystem yeah I was it made me happy that I spent so much money on that ipad pro which
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.600]   was really a speculative purchase of hoping that the ipad pro would justify its cost and the fact
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:18.320]   that I can move the mouse from my iMac to my Mac book to my ipad and then take a file on my ipad
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:24.480]   and drag it back across is phenomenal it's a universal clipboard but made in a way that's so
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.200]   easy to relate to just so like intuitive to you so they're putting like really nice front ends on
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.000]   all of this geekier technology they've been invested they give us more information on on that in the
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.240]   sessions you know how yeah so basically they had all these ideas for like acoustic modeling like
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.880]   you put out low tones on the iMac and the ipad would identify where they're coming from and
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.840]   know where they are or they would use time of flight yeah or they'd use time of flight but
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.560]   they're just like no you're going to drag the mouse in the direction that you think that you
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.960]   know the computer is so why should we even bother users gonna pick it up you're moving and it does
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:03.280]   require Wi-Fi and bluetooth to be on right so it's obviously using that is it using uwb no probably
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.600]   not no it's not it's not like it does it works a sin like Renee said it's user intention if your
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.040]   ipad's on the right and you drag to the right it says okay the ipad's on the right and then it
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.440]   puts that little gray bar up but how does it know the ipad's on the right i mean because you put the
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.480]   because you moved the mouse you moved the cursor that direction but it could be okay so if you had a
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.640]   iMac a mac book and an ipad in a row how would it know if you want to mess with yourself you could
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.160]   fool it don't don't try to fool it put the mac book on the left and the and the ipad on the right
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.040]   okay most people use it with two devices it's it's basically sidecar without is there do you have
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.120]   to turn it on configure it it sounds like it's exactly sidecar it's uses the same principles and
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.520]   the same devices that are compatible with sidecar like it's doing a bluetooth low energy handshake
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.240]   to see what's there make sure it's logged into your apple account then it'll connect over Wi-Fi
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.560]   direct so it's a much much faster technology and it uses things like time of flight so people can't
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.480]   intercept it or relay it or do any sort of those kinds of attacks that's amazing it's a really good
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.880]   security model and also like it you have to be in proximity to it so that you're not doing
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.160]   something on your ipad locally and then someone at school sees you doing it you know there's like
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.280]   all sorts of really good safeguards in there and of course the first thing that people say and
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.520]   first thing came up for me is this is a great ecosystem play because of course you can't do it
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.400]   with any other device and i think the right ecosystem play in a way you mentioned sidecar
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.960]   sidecar is this idea where you basically can turn an ipad into a mac display right but it's still
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.120]   the mac display and you're still controlling it and running your mac apps and you can use the pencil
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.600]   and stuff but mostly it's just using it as a third just third party display it's just like
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.360]   extra monitor for my mac right and this is not that right this is you're still using your keyboard
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.720]   and your trackpad but when it's on the ipad you're using the ipad and the ipads apps and when you're
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.720]   on the mac part you're using the mac and you're using the macs app so i think it's actually a much
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:54.160]   better approach than just saying well what if your ipad turned into a dumb monitor for your mac
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.840]   which is what the first step was but this is what you can do now too with the mac with airplay
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.440]   to mac like they've made everything cool you can take over your ipad you can take over your mac
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.600]   you can take over you can just use both and and this is there's kind of we got to make up a term
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:12.480]   for what apple does all the time maybe it's syncrestic but uh which is a little obscure but
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:20.000]   the idea that apple is constantly adding features that at some point are going to merge into a larger
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.760]   more powerful hole do you see what i'm saying for instance uh the keyboard and trackpad on the ipad
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.680]   sorta made sense but now it really makes sense because you're using a mouse and keyboard on your
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.200]   mac and it works with your ipad it's things like that that apple's really good at and this is why
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.400]   i think there's a secret very detailed roadmap because secret plan to fight inflation and i know
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.760]   at the end of the line of the road map is some sort of weird ar spectacles in a car but but but
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.400]   you can see it kind of happening bit by bit and i love it when it you actually uh
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.440]   when a plan comes together i think actually a lot of when a platform comes together you use
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   that line yeah and that's exactly it they have big plans and pants to match i guess
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:12.320]   and they that's a reference and i think like one of the stories of this event if you if the
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.560]   same question to me that you asked rene um oh yeah we haven't gotten to each of you i thought
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.640]   so rene uh is is the idea that as a mac user especially i'm so used to apple product announcements
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.880]   being here are some features for the ipad and the iphone and here are some features for the iphone
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.200]   and here are some features that uh and this feature will sort of be on the mac but not and then oh
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.280]   let's talk about the mac here's a totally different thing we're playing catch up over here and then
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.840]   we we've implemented this thing but not all the way and those days feel like they're completely over
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.160]   and it's because apple has spent the last few years unifying these platforms to the point where
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.360]   now when they roll out a feature it just rolls out to all of them like they're the facetime stuff is on
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.480]   iphone and ipad and mac so many of these features they're a hundred percent on the mac just like
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.640]   they're on the ipad and the iphone they move in lockstep and you know that was their plan five
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.040]   years ago and they looked at their platforms and they said we can't do this yet we like we're not
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.160]   even running some of our base software has drifted so far apart that we can't even do it and uh and
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.400]   they seem to have gotten there this year it's funny because they threw a little misdirection and by
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:20.000]   naming their each device has its own name for its operating system even though they're all
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:29.200]   ios or macos but it's ios ipad os watch os tv os but when you say platform you're saying the apple
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.360]   platform yeah the the super platform the over right that this is especially for their three main
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:42.400]   primary computing device platforms the ipad and the and the mac this is they're all moving together
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.040]   as this kind of like overarching platform should mac fans take this is a good sign that the mac
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.840]   is uh persists in this that it's as important it's a co-equal i would because i got really tired
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.400]   of seeing apple introduce really wizzy features on iphone and then the mac got a bad version of
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.120]   it two years later yeah exactly now what they really should have done during the keynote is just
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.800]   rerun all the announcements like three times where it's getting it yet and now and now we're doing
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.120]   how are you in facetime with like we were doing with another platform one of the
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.320]   parts that's so interesting though is they got their own custom silicon now like one of the things
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.960]   like they merged a lot of the software teams years ago like the messages team is now a mac and
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.400]   ios messaging team but because they were using app kit on the mac and they had different frameworks
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.720]   and all these things and they had to use intel and amd or intel intel integrated it still took a
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.840]   long time it was extra effort to do everything on the mac and now they have m1 on like apple
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.640]   silicon across all these platforms we got things like live text using a neural engine to in real
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.120]   time go through and make all your text editable all your text selectable all your text actionable
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.200]   and they can just put that on the mac they don't have to rewrite that for intel for six different
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   years of intel chipsets and intel into gpu's and amd potentially gpu's offloading all that which
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.680]   is a considerable amount of effort and to jason's point we would get that next year maybe than a
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.720]   year after maybe never on the mac and this year we just got all of those neural engine features for
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.920]   free on n1 macs because it's the same chip that's in the ipad and the and the iphone this year so
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:14.960]   jason you would say that if of the highlights that you're calling out one is unified platform
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.720]   yeah anything else i'll throw out um a super nerdy one but i think maybe listeners of twit will
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.240]   appreciate it which is shortcuts on the mac very interesting there's so many i mean first off it's
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.800]   just what we were talking about which is this is an app that's existed on iphone and ipad and
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.160]   bringing that they bought by the way right yeah they bought it was called workflow it's a third
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.760]   party app that we couldn't believe was even allowed in the app store and then they bought it and they
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.920]   made it a part of the seery team and they rolled it out as shortcuts but they rewrote it this year
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.440]   in swift ui their sort of new cross platform interface development environment and that goes
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:54.320]   across all the platforms so actually the interface is new on the mac but that same interface is also
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.440]   now on the ipad and the iphone and what they said was this is the future of user automation on the
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.880]   mac and if you haven't been paying attention to mac user automation most people haven't you
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.160]   know south segue and stood up on stage when they launched tiger so that was what 2005 and they
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:15.520]   introduced automator and since then kind of nothing out of apple in terms of user automation that
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:23.520]   team got expanded yeah and so what now we see is that they incubated this shortcut stuff on ipad
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.240]   and iphone and are taking that step to the mac and it's not the baby version of automation it runs
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.280]   shell scripts it runs apple scripts it runs java scripts it's always a script compatible it well
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.800]   because it's running scripts it will run the osa which is the open open scripting architecture
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.520]   that's running on on apple's platform so apple script and java script basically it will run those
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.160]   but it'll also run you know a pearl script a python script anything else very exciting shell
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.880]   script all the stuff that you can call out to and that's what you do in automator or apple
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   script before you can call out to any script to run it that gives you infinite capability
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.240]   basically it really does nothing you can't obviously that won't work on the ipad because
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   there's no command line and there's no shell access there but on the mac side it's they've
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.520]   replicated but that's the risk isn't it's of automated you don't want to fork this so what
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   you'd like to do is have shortcuts have the same capabilities across the board right i think the
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.280]   idea there is that the platforms are different so some of the ideas like opening windows on the
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.760]   mac is not a thing you do on the ipad but you can open multitasking instances on the ipad
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.520]   and you can't do either of those things on the iphone and one thing that i haven't played a lot
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.760]   with but you know one of the blocks in shortcuts is device name so it's you can write a shortcut that
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.440]   says is this a mac if so do this yeah if it's an ipad do this different thing and write one
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   shortcut it syncs across iCloud is it over for apple script in uh automator or apple script
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:53.040]   i i wonder about the future of scripting on apple's platforms because apple script is really old
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.920]   it's from system seven era and i only kept it around because there were legacy applications
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.280]   well and there are a lot of the problem the challenge is is apple script allows a level of
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:10.160]   detail that i'm not sure um shortcuts is providing access to in individual apps the moment that
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.520]   shortcuts if they make a drive towards saying no no we want everything that you can script and
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.880]   that goes down to like a line you move the cursor one character over in a text editor stuff like
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.760]   that that you can do an apple script if you could do that using shortcuts i think they would probably
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.240]   feel just say i but when they say it's a multi-year transition i think that's why is because
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.600]   they this is step one of of a whole lot more but it's very exciting because in doing that they also
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.560]   brought over everything that automator was capable of doing and built a version of that so that they
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   could import automator workflows on the mac all those functions also run on on ios now so you can do
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.360]   all sorts of stuff on the ipad using shortcuts that you couldn't do before because they wanted to
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.920]   bring up parity with the mac version it would be smart to learn shortcuts at this point it sounds
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.560]   like i think you know one of the problems and this is because we're old mac old timers going back to
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:06.080]   1984 so we remember all this but with apple script the idea was applications would provide
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.520]   a dictionary of capabilities an apple script could hook into that but fewer and fewer applications
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.320]   do that it just died off and and instead what you've got on ios is something called intense
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.280]   in the intense framework and it's the it's the same idea it's what can you do with this app and
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.320]   then you can furnish that out for someone else to do things with the app yeah yeah so that's good
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.800]   that's a good architecture it's a forward thinking architecture i agree with you i think that's going
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.400]   to be a interesting and very big change philip what do you think now your article on tom's guide
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.080]   said apples walled garden just got even higher yeah is that a good thing or a bad thing it's a
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.120]   good thing in that as jason was saying all the the different devices are working together and
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.160]   in concert and you you there's a good thing if you use if you live in the ecosystem and you're happy
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.200]   and if you live in the ecosystem and they're happy it's great if you ever think about wandering
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:03.360]   off to use someone else's stuff the the macbook air in front of you here um i'm not really happy
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.280]   with this machine and and i i wouldn't mind experimenting with with other platforms and with
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.040]   other laptops your linux curious aren't you yeah yeah but boy oh boy i'm not going to do it now if
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.200]   no the mac os and the of the future and the the uh iphone os are gonna are gonna work i have this
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.840]   funny i have the same prompt because i love android especially what google's doing now with android 12
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.480]   uh i'm using linux right now i love linux but there is a lot of this incentive there's so much
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.160]   incentive to use an iphone and i bet in the mac uh there's so much benefit to that but i don't
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.440]   think it's good for the overall for the technology ecosystem to have a you know that's that's uh
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.360]   that's like bananas that's a mono in the sense of it's a it's a monoculture
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.640]   you know what i mean actual bananas yeah it's not just crazy bananas it's actual bananas
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.680]   we're at where there's a problem with bananas because there's only one strain of bananas it's
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:03.280]   still surviving and it's being attacked by a by a parasite and that means we might be out of bananas
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.760]   it's a bad idea to have a mono conno in bananas yeah we need yeah they're good by the way yes we need
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:13.840]   more bananas try those yes we need more bananas so the risk of a monoculture is it's vulnerable
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.160]   we have the choice like if you don't if you want them if you want like the all-in ecosystem you know
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.400]   curated experience you can go with apple and get your iphone and your mac and your ipad and be
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.480]   perfectly happy and not have to sweat any details or configure anything or do all those things like
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.960]   you if you're just you don't care about the technology you just need tools to get a job done and you
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.280]   don't want to fuss or must you have this option on one side and if you do if you're like a hobbyist
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.880]   if you're a tinkerer if you're somebody who wants to have a whole wide variety yeah then you can
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.120]   get android and windows and linux and all these things and i worry that you know people will
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.360]   prosecute this idea of apple being a monoculture so much that the people who do benefit from it
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.280]   will have it taken away from them and they'll just be stuck with a bunch of hobbyist tools that
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.680]   they really hate that you know it's much worse for them that it was having something easy to use
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.920]   because they didn't care about the technology and and you know for people like us i have an android
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.920]   phone and an iphone you know and i have a windows machine and i have a bunch of apple machines and
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.520]   i get to do that sort of i don't know that's an indulgence and a privilege but i get to do that
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.400]   sort of both the theme park and the flea market i love that that to me is the best solution yeah
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.880]   well and i'm like you i mean that's that's a hazard of our trade as much as anything else
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.920]   it's a bugger a feature i'm not sure but well yeah and i i mixed feelings about this you know
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:30.080]   we'll talk a little bit later congress has passed now on friday uh has introduced five new bills to
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.680]   regulate the tech industry one of which i'm all of four is an interoperability bill that would
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.800]   require companies to provide data portability so that you wouldn't be stuck in their walled garden
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.960]   i think they don't define data yeah well it's common with money yeah i don't think congress is
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.200]   really going to be the right person to figure this out but but it's obviously not in companies
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:54.240]   interests to do this uh and so they're going to have to be forced to do it if they if it's ever
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.600]   going to happen but it's definitely in consumers interest to have this portability a walled garden
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   is not good in general for the ecosystem is it i think the challenge with apple inventing some of
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.280]   these things that work best across its devices is that there's a question of who's going to do it if
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.880]   apple doesn't do it right it is certainly kind of innovation so this universal control
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.320]   where you've got a laptop and you've got a desktop and you can move the mouse back and forth and it
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:23.360]   all works magically like if microsoft step up and said we really like this feature we would like to
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:28.560]   also implement it on windows we want this to be a standard well here's the thing like there are
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.880]   two responses apple could have apple could have the response of like great that's great why not
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.120]   or they would say no no we made this ball it's our ball we're going to take it and go home and that's
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.240]   where the dividing line is because i think the argument is if you wait around for a and just industry
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.280]   wide consortium these things aren't going to get invented and they do make apples products better
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:53.840]   i don't think the primary intent is to wall apple off but they know that that's the secondary effect
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.160]   yeah it's not bad for the bottom line although there is an example a counter example which is
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:04.480]   project chip now called matter which did appear on stage a few times that was an industry wide
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.160]   consortium that was really responding to the fact that consumers were not using home automation
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:15.200]   because it was a tower of babble nothing interoperated you had a buy a base station for every different
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.680]   device it wasn't a good experience and companies really well this we're never going to be able to
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:25.760]   sell products in in this sphere so apple even they don't make a security camera but they're now
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.600]   offering unlimited storage on i-cloud plus for home kit security cameras that this is an example of
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:38.320]   sometimes the the the the right thing to do is also uh the right thing to do for consumers a good
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.400]   thing for the bottom line and sometimes you just have to i agree with you though you wouldn't have
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.160]   the innovation you're getting from apple right now if it wasn't an ecosystem and you still get
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.320]   companies copying each other all the time well that's what a lot of what apple did well exactly
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.960]   when apple was announcing the the live text and the the quick look up you can imagine android users
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.680]   are sitting there like leo decaprio and though once upon a time in the hollywood going yeah yeah
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.640]   well the entire face time set is essentially oh boy we're really behind zoom aren't yeah yeah
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.840]   they even went to the extreme of of making face time work on android and windows yes
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.760]   cyclic you're not as proud of you as well values of working yes
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:23.360]   uh so it is it was very interesting i think i'll at least the first half hour to hour was catch up
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.920]   was yeah we don't do this but we're going to do it now uh you know microsoft has lens google has lens
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:34.320]   both at the same names which is weird uh and now apple has something not called lens i've wall
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.880]   it was kind of interesting but i don't i don't want to i'm i'm finished yet philip i want to give
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.360]   you a chance to mention the the top line things that you think are worth oh yeah the the we mentioned
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:52.160]   face time the thing that really struck me there is the um the api that apple uh plans to put out so
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:59.520]   that developers can actually uh work with share play to um uh integrate that into their apps and
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.040]   the first thing you think of of course is sharing video sharing music and what have you but this is
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.520]   the feature that lets you watch a Netflix movie with the family right basically it's it's apple
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:15.680]   saying oh that uh that uh netflix extension that uh everyone's down voting last year we're we're
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.200]   gonna take that but i and they've lined up partnerships with your disney's and your houlouse and all the
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:28.160]   big there are members but i i really see a lot of developers taking that uh uh uh uh tool and running
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:34.080]   with it to integrate uh share play into their apps i i i can see dating apps having a field date with
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:40.640]   uh with that sort of thing good and so day yeah uh uh an extra feature in in in their uh application
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   when i see these features i think oh it's too bad that the pandemic's almost over you took you a
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.520]   year you can figure this out and now the pandemic but now i realize pandemic may be over but people
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.400]   still are gonna stay in their house it's over in the u.s and that's true it's a worldwide phenomenon
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.560]   that continues but but uh it's using the whiteboard people we're gonna use that whiteboard version of
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.120]   share play all day i'm not sure people are gonna go back to dating in real life i think there might
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.480]   still be a lot of uh you know virtual dating virtual schooling virtual work because a lot of people
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.440]   realize hey this isn't so bad i might want to keep doing this in fact this is gonna be i i foresee
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.560]   this being a big problem for companies uh with employees who don't want to go back in fact apple
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:24.320]   employees wrote a letter which got leaked out uh saying we don't all you you think we all want
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:31.760]   to come back to work Tim we don't you said you're not listening Tim you're writing uh lines in your
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   in your company wide memo saying we're all looking forward to getting back together in the same
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.640]   building and we're not i don't know how widespread that revolt is at apple but i hear from other
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.760]   companies people are quitting rather than going back and it depends on can i destroy their universe
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.360]   it depends on what the job is right like obviously there are jobs at apple especially if you're
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   building products that are probably only really well done in person but there are also jobs that
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:59.920]   are marketing or writing or documentation or things like that that you could do a distributed
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.760]   workforce and it would probably be fine the the problem i had with Tim Cook's announcement was
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.440]   it seemed very one size fits all that doesn't necessarily mean that's actually how it was inside
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.680]   apple but it seems like maybe it was perceived that way and there is a little bit of a fallacy
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.280]   in saying what we learned from the pandemic is that you can work at home two days a week but
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.520]   you still have to come in to the office the other three days because not everything we learned from
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.040]   the pandemic was it's nice to work at home some of it was it's really expensive to live in the bay
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.840]   area and i can do my job from somewhere else and that wasn't addressed in the memo so it's going
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   to be a challenge yeah i mean uh housing prices up here have gone through the roof meringue because
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.920]   people don't want to live in san francisco and they don't have to anymore people are moving to
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.880]   Nebraska i like corn corporations are buying all the houses anyway i'm gonna be a nation or enters
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.600]   that's an interesting thing too i saw that the other day that uh a lot of the houses being sold
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:54.880]   are not being bought by individuals but by companies what are they gonna do is it like air B&D they're
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.520]   gonna rent them out no they they dislike the idea of people having a generational well so they
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.600]   figure they'll remove that by just making it yeah we don't want that that would be a bad thing no
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.920]   we want to keep you in a way to extract the money Leo i mean they can't if they only have 80 percent
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:13.200]   of the wealth that not have 90 percent of the wealth in the country i'm trying to think of what i
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.000]   thought was uh was very exciting you guys have mentioned really actually all of the uh some
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.120]   of the things i was really excited about i as an old guy i kind of like the idea that i can have a
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:29.360]   legacy uh administrator take over my accounts after i pass away i thought that was very interesting
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.200]   of apple that amounts it's funny that they phrased it in that way because what they really did is
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.480]   sort of announce apple id reform but they did it in a very hard way because they've been you know
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.040]   apple id they needed to fix that were itunes id's and they were really just there so that you could
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:48.880]   buy drm music on itunes and it's evolved into this passport for their entire ecosystem and there's
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.640]   still parts of it that have been way behind and really kind of broken and those announcements about
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.480]   not just your legacy so if you die you can designate somebody before not in that order by the way uh
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.520]   you can designate somebody to take care of your account after you die but also that you can if
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:11.360]   you lose access to your account you can have designated somebody who will be able to get you back in
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.840]   and these are problems that have been huge in terms of supporting people who are in apple's
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.480]   ecosystem for years now and it all goes back to the fact that it really wasn't designed to be a system
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.760]   and they have those are major reforms that are going to stop a lot of people from losing their
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.520]   data their photos i get calls all the time for people with apple id woes yeah and a lot of the answer
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.680]   is we can't get you back in and apple can't get you back in and that's what this is all about
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.840]   they had a they had a big problem a few years ago we're like around the ios seven time the
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:45.120]   info second urge one they want everything they ran rampant through like two factor was everything
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.120]   was fail secure so if any problem happened you were just locked out apple couldn't help you anybody
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.480]   couldn't help you and a lot of nerds love that like you know like literally just because we know
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.280]   it's secure not because we love how it works but but it's not well but the thing is that for most
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.880]   people and i i learned this from dave nanny and he sat me down and said please stop this because
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.480]   it's not how humans work right you know when you come when it comes to backing up important things
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.160]   most people's fear isn't you know someone's gonna steal this photograph is that i'm gonna lose
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:13.600]   photographs of my of my wedding of my children and you have to have fails like fail safe like his
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.520]   whole thing was don't encrypt your black up your backup drives please and apple had this sort of
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   moment where they had to realize and he doesn't know it's health to that you can't be absolutist
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.520]   about privacy yes there are some people who are zealots or some people who want everything locked
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.240]   but you have to be compassionate for for people who just who need their data and that's why we got
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.720]   the new version of two factor that had like you didn't have to keep that recovery code printed out
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.440]   and if you lost it that was it all your stuff was gone forever now there it does create a risk
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.600]   because maybe people can subpoena it but they can help you recover it and now one step further your
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.080]   legacy or recovery contact so i mean the info second urge are going to be super super angry
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.160]   about this we'll see articles about it but i think the humans sort of won this one
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:59.920]   it's a pendulum uh we we did a last year which seems like a hundred years ago we did a panel on
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.960]   the security with bruce snire and uh it was really great and one of the things bruce pointed out is
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:11.040]   that a lot of stuff fails insecure that that's not at all unusual for firewalls another corporate
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:17.920]   enterprise security features to fail insecure they'll save that's not good but on the other hand
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:24.720]   failing safe every time is also hard for users so there it does seem like you need to find a happy
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.560]   middle ground in apple you need to pick your data types like some data types should fail secure
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.480]   absolutely like that information is better lost than made public and some should fail safe
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.400]   where that information is better for you to be able to recover it than it is for it to be gone
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.640]   like it's again it's an encrypted backup drive if that fails secure you are never getting those
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.280]   photos back if that fails safe you can take it to a recovery company i had a guy called yesterday
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.360]   said i just might my wife's iphone was full and i wanted to get some get her stuff off on an i
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:59.280]   cloud so i logged into it with my iTunes account and bought some iCloud and then logged and kind
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:04.160]   of the the really the bottom line is never use your apple idea on anybody else's device that's
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:11.120]   always a always a bad idea it didn't work as predicted i guess it wasn't exactly what he thought
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:18.800]   was going to have happened um get locked out i i have we have a lot of related stories to go into
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:25.200]   including by the way apple revealing that the trump administration d oj got a trove of information
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:35.040]   about democrats in the house judiciary committee or the ostensibly in a attempt to find leaks but
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.600]   really to target them bob woodward said this is nixon on steroids we'll talk about that apple
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:46.480]   revealed uh because the gag order was lifted a bunch of that there's a lot more to talk about
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:53.920]   those five five count of five bills to cut big tech down to size introduced in the house
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:00.560]   this is going to be fun we have there if you thought it's going to be all apple oh no there's
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.080]   a lot of other stuff um did we get everything we didn't obviously you know what i'll tell you i
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:12.000]   am excited because and i already kind of alluded to this because i spent an ungodly some of money on
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.960]   the new twenty twenty one m one ipad i bought the top of the line which is twenty four hundred
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.320]   dollars when you add it all up oh yeah on the premise that well apple must have something planned
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:28.000]   so i was very relieved to see the new multitasking which i until i use it i won't be sure but it
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   looks like they've kind of fixed multitasking on uh on ipad o s there's some new features in ipad
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.240]   o s and i think to me the one i want to watch you wanted to watch shortcuts i agree with you i
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.920]   think that's going to be interesting shortcuts on the mac for me swift playgrounds on the ipad
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:52.320]   able to make apple apps is fascinating i don't and again this is one where i'll have to try it to see
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.040]   can you make a real app at least you could put on the store but will it really be something
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:02.480]   somebody will want or is it a low code no code did you grenade did you get any briefings on that
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.320]   because i think that's really interesting yeah you know it's it's really a swift UI experience and
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.280]   i think it's meant at this stage to be um an alternative to people who'd otherwise begin their
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.760]   coding with some web based tutorial or on the mac and in full place it's not a it's not a full
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.080]   code environment i mean it's not an x code obviously but you can have your app rejected by the
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.920]   app is totally any other developer but i can make far to get out so easily now i don't uh
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.440]   has to be a hundred percent swift yeah and swift ui and swift but i wonder can you i guess you can
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.080]   code lines of swift yes you can do all of that and you can submit it the problem is that most apps
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.400]   that you would submit uh that these days have things that aren't swift in them they still got
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.760]   some legacy right you know objective c stuff like that you can see what happens you want to get rid
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.200]   all of that we would you know and they don't want it you to write objective c they want you to write
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.480]   and swift and swift ui entirely so this is a way to do that that's going to be the challenges can
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:02.640]   i write a useful app and swift and swift ui alone right and my guess is probably not
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:08.800]   today yeah i i think that's something to watch i really do i think that's going to be very
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.280]   interesting uh and i'll be an extra code uh x code in the cloud i think is going to be
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.640]   a huge over time there are a lot of interesting developer stories yeah
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.840]   yeah but i think this one is particularly interesting because we've all been wondering
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.720]   about how apple's going to bring final cut or hop is going to bring logic or hop is going to be
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:29.360]   bringing x code to the ipad which has a very different set of interface realities around it and also
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.960]   like the amount of ram the amount of storage you can get on those are very different than the mac
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.600]   but if you suddenly have access to x code cloud and you're typing away on your mac and then you
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.320]   pick it up you pick up your ipad and you go to the sofa but like your your true story your sync is
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:47.200]   all still on your mac and still in the cloud that enables a whole different kind of workflow and
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.800]   collaboration which apple has not been great at with any of their pro apps historically
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.880]   but it opens up to not just like a port of an ipad but a whole new paradigm of using
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.880]   all of your apple stuff on any of your devices yeah that's really interesting it's also
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.760]   this is another one of those where it's parity with existing platforms a lot of enterprises do
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.400]   a continuous integration development they need that and now you can do that with x code yeah
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.120]   you concurrency well you could still have concurrency but now they have a nice safe way to do concurrency
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.600]   yes um yeah there was a lot of stuff i thought i'll be interested to find out more about
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:31.760]   iCloud plus and the the it's not exactly a vpn but uh the iCloud relay that's going to be very
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:39.120]   interesting if you have to use safari uh but if if that it looks like it's on by default
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.080]   that's gonna really ask you pardon me well there's both there's they all safari is doing the ip
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:51.440]   screening as part of their desire to reduce the amount of personal information that's basically
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:58.000]   DNS as a full on service yeah uh full on service if you have if you are paying for iCloud will you
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.480]   automatically get iCloud relay and we'll be on on a i got yeah i just got asked to pop them said
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.760]   do you want to use it and then i said yes and the same with the mail and the mail one is fast
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.440]   saying to me too because they're not using machine learning to try to guess what the tracking pixel
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.680]   is and then remove it they're opening the full mail and crypt it on their side and then giving you
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.600]   a picture of it oh why every mail client everywhere is going to think it's a hundred percent open
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:22.640]   rate for every email is in danger either from malamor many many email clients including plenty
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.360]   available for iOS and Mac OS don't allow tracking pixels that's an easy thing to do my client
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.240]   doesn't allow images of any kind but this is going much farther i didn't realize was who were doing
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.040]   that um yeah so all the mail client gets back as apple they don't they don't know that you did
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:43.600]   it how often you did it for mailing list people for marketers this is this is going to be a very
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:49.120]   interesting battle because basically apple and google's doing this too uh are saying well first
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.040]   party's fine but anything other than the first party information it's not going to be allowed on
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:58.240]   our platforms facebook's gonna have a whole new newspaper ad well facebook's doing it too believe
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:02.000]   me facebook if you're a if you have a facebook account they got everything they ever wanted to
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.640]   know about you anyway right they're just adding more but uh they know plenty about you same with
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.160]   google's and truthfully same with apple um not both disclosing every link to every like if you go
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.480]   to apps and i was going to show you every sdk that they're linking out to from that app like that
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.960]   has any sort of not even just marketing apps but anything that that that sdk links out to you're
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.720]   gonna get a nice list of url showing you where your activity is being long so this clearly giving
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.200]   people what they want i mean there's no question at all that google's only doing it because they
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.000]   have to but apple's doing it because it's good for business but it's giving people what they want
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.520]   but at the same time i don't know if it's a good thing for the general internet ecosystem you know
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:47.120]   this could be this could be disaster you know your for instance you uh rene are on youtube so
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.640]   you don't have to worry because youtube tracking the hell out everybody watching your videos well
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.880]   there is a concern so like and i have been talking to people about this so for example if somebody
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.960]   is using this and they're logged in it won't matter because youtube has perfect google anybody that
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.120]   you're on your platform they have perfect knowledge but if you're not logged in right if you're just
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:08.320]   open a web browser it's not like you're an incognito or private mode because that would just height
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.400]   like that would just not index your search queries but this is actually obfuscating your ip and apple
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.800]   is smart enough not to completely obfuscate it like it's still going to show that you're in petaluma
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.360]   because there's a whole host of internet information that's useful to you if they like for deliveries
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.680]   or for where hotels are like right knowing where you are in general is good not just not just not
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.640]   just my little switch that you have i understand and i'm play with it you have there's a little switch
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:36.240]   that says yeah i want general location information passed along yeah right because otherwise there's
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.360]   no information it's not your ip address it's it's not even apple's ip address so third party ip
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.240]   address like cloud flare they encrypt your information on your end they send that to an apple relay
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.640]   which then you know gives you a temporary ip address which tends to be regionally based then
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.280]   forwards that to a second relay that's not under apples control which then decrypts it and sends the
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.320]   question off to the internet for for resolving and that means that neither side of that has your
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.840]   full picture like there's zero there's nobody that has perfect knowledge of you in that exchange
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:10.560]   which is the goal yes how fast is it is is responsive zero slow down as far as i can tell
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:15.840]   that's the theory tor uses at least three nodes so it's and it's gonna be faster than that and uh
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:21.360]   i will see how it looks when everybody uses it right now it's just beat on the people on the beta
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:27.200]   but uh the third party at least the one i've seen is cloud flare which has plenty of server
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.040]   space and plenty of bandwidth so what are they what are they using in canada
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:36.160]   do you know have you looked at the third party yeah well we have cloud flare i'm assuming it's
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.680]   gonna be the same in china it's not gonna be the same and maybe not in front like any country that
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:44.080]   has big data breation that's probably why they're doing it that way isn't it come to think of it
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.160]   well i i mean it's gonna be a big probably like i i know china is like an easy one to identify but
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.360]   there are so many countries that are really interested in data repatriation at this point like
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.800]   they just don't want america involved in their data and apple's gonna have to start it like the
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.240]   internet which was this international thing is gonna be incredibly provincial and regionalized over
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.000]   the next yeah also when you're doing that two step thing and apple's giving you the choice of
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.560]   being sort of very narrow or a little bit broader with your location uh in the united states that's
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.160]   a little bit different especially if you're someplace like california it's probably like are you in the
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.720]   bay area or are you in california in individual countries it's probably going to be are you in
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:21.440]   this very specific place in this country or you in the country and that probably means they're
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:26.880]   gonna need to have country specific relays absolutely because the fact is so much of the web is based
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:34.320]   on geo location not for privacy gpr but for yeah but for laws and for licensing of content and
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:40.000]   things like that yeah you can't if you live in europe you can't read the uh i don't want to try
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   free press i don't know if it is the truth but there may be l_a_ times l_a_ times it's not readable in
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.720]   europe because they don't want to have to do gpr and your your youtube session and your Netflix
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:54.000]   session and anything else you do are going to be based on where you are located yeah yeah so you
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.960]   can't geo hop for your Netflix right and that's not the purpose of apples feature right to do it
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.440]   you still may need to be dead yes and and by the way it's not like corporate stuff there's no like
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.960]   corporate tunneling features where it either so you can't use it to get exclusive access to some
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:11.440]   stuff and i noted that it does say i cloud relay turns off as soon as you turn on a vpn because
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.480]   that would get in the way exactly yeah it's very it's i think it's it's it's i'm going to say it
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:26.080]   it's an interesting land grab from apple it's a it's subtle what apples up to but if you put all
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:32.080]   the pieces together it's a very aggressive play uh and it's giving people what they want
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:38.480]   um and that's interesting you know i guess you can't go wrong giving people what others are
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.120]   going to be driven right to google well because they don't like it so yeah and if you're a marketer
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.800]   or if you have a newsletter there's lots of people we're going to go oh my god what are we
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:52.880]   going to do now go back to advertising like they'll do service they'll figure it out and they'll
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.280]   figure it out yeah a lot of a lot of the wrote that in platform yeah a lot of the targeting is not
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:04.080]   necessary and i i you know from my background in in media companies uh salespeople really like to
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.720]   drum up data and claim that data has value and it mostly doesn't you know you're
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:14.400]   telling me until 20 years ago that knew nothing it was entirely on faith no nothing
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.360]   absolutely and and they and they made it they survived yeah but the minute they could get
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.400]   perfect knowledge about their user they that's like crack they gotta have it right can't live
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.120]   without it i think that if you're a sub stack newsletter person you don't need to know your
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.440]   open rate you just need to look at your water though you look you need to look at your subscription
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:39.600]   numbers and see if you're serving that audience that way yeah day to day it is like crack day to day
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   open rates you don't need to know that nobody feels good when you read it doesn't it so i i do
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.400]   want that like so that is one point of concern i have because i do i don't need to know like Jason
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.000]   watched my video or opened my newsletter but i would like to know what percentage of my
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.440]   audience is enjoying my content because if i go the wrong direction and even though like they
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.200]   haven't unsubscribed yet but less and less people are watching are like reading it or watching it
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.640]   i want to reverse that trend and i want to do it before people start unsubscribing
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.240]   so i'm a little bit on the border here like i would like general knowledge about how happy
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.480]   my audience is i don't need to know specifically but i would like to know if people are actually
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.880]   reading there's a really interesting thing going on and you know the other example of this is
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:27.760]   Amazon sidewalk where people are almost knee jerk against tracking and ignoring kind of the
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.960]   benefit i mean the reason we have a free internet with tons of great content is because we've got
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:40.000]   an ad ecosystem because we have tracking sidewalk is an attempt by amazon to create something that i
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.080]   think has a real public value yes it's from amazon and yes amazon will gain value from it but i think
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:52.720]   we all could a mesh network over the all of our neighborhoods with low power not high speed but
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:53:02.240]   low power connections has real value but people are so anti amazon but also so anti corporate and
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:06.320]   anti technology that they're kind of throw i feel i worry that we're throwing the baby out with the
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:11.680]   bath water amazon was kind of sketchy with a lot of their i mean they've done a lot of release
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.920]   scale it hasn't been to their advantage that they have a background that says you know burn this
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:20.880]   recognition and ring doorbells and yeah they've earned a lot of really bad stuff but there's also i
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.040]   think a knee jerk reaction and and by the way i know it well because our it's anybody who listens
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:29.760]   to our shows chances are nine out of ten that you are on that side of the equation that you're
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.960]   right you're really pro privacy anti tracking and listening to steve gibson yeah if that doesn't
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:39.120]   explain then amazon rules this thing out and sort of doesn't tell anybody and makes it knocked out
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:44.640]   and like i i think sidewalk is no one would have turned it on had they given you the choice right
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.720]   make the case like treat us like adults and make the case i know i know i know us on it i mean they
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.880]   have a nice lady who lives in a box in my kitchen and she could say hey i've got this new feature
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.840]   and ask me tell me about it but she didn't have that the only people who will have the choice
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.520]   turn this on and offer people who already have those amazon devices in their houses
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:08.080]   so all of the privacy that you wanted is already you already signed off that's the thing is there's
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.200]   a perfectly good argument to make here but amazon with its reputation then kind of sneaks it in
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.920]   and says yeah we're going to be giving your neighbor's access to your Wi-Fi uh just for bandwidth uh
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.200]   but never mind it's fine it's gonna be fine and it's like nothing to see here i think there's
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   a better argument i mean i don't like it when Comcast wants to offer free Wi-Fi hot spots out
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:31.280]   of my house i don't like it either right turn it off i agree but again there's the argument to be
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.840]   made i think that that's something like sidewalk it is good see it is what it would explain what
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:40.720]   xfinity did only redone a xfinity's benefit sure they made money off it because now you're an
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:44.960]   xfinity customer and you have access to these hot spots amazon i think really this is something
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:50.160]   that is they had an open api it's probably a hundred percent privacy forward yeah anybody can use it
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:56.160]   and with this cap so that they don't steal everyone's family there's a huge community value to it
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.720]   maybe the issue was simply positioning but but honestly that's too bad because we're going to
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.440]   miss out i think on a lot of things that could make our world better because people are so
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.160]   knee jerk afraid of it and maybe these companies aren't but expressing it you know i mean it's a
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.680]   pr failure okay yes but that's a shame we're gonna educate us like they have time they can
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:19.040]   educate us they still could they could go out they could start doing a proper educational campaign
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.600]   started on monday i would i would love it it would be it would be fantastic so as far as i can tell
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.400]   sidewalk's dead in the water because enough people now know about it and and there's such a reaction
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.960]   to it that it's over and then i think that's a lot of justice point they have a lexa zero like
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.040]   they have n.0 they could be they could have a whole fresh opportunity if they just get their
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.440]   act together well maybe they will you know maybe that maybe there is a lesson to be learned meanwhile
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:48.320]   jeff bezos is going off in space so you can wave goodbye later suckers he saves so much money on taxes
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.520]   that he can afford to go off in this you know it's funny and i don't know what the story is i'm
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.920]   gonna have to really start reading the pro publica stories on this tax thing but jeff jarves was very
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:01.280]   upset he said jeff bezos has paid over 20 years billions of dollars in taxes there were sure there
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:05.840]   were some years where it was zero but those were offset against losses and he paid taxes in the
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.240]   other years and it's really not fair to cherry pick those years where he didn't pay taxes because
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:16.240]   he paid billions on other years and as he says it's unfair but i haven't really looked into it so
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:21.360]   and if you guys have an opinion on that we could we could bring that one up too but i do need to
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:29.280]   take a break because i don't want to be like john groover we're only an hour into the show your
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:34.720]   shirt fully buttoned these guys before the show we're talking about how uh when you're on uh
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:39.520]   groover's podcast you're about an hour or two hours in you realize he's still got four ads today
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.360]   but you know the same thing happens we're too we were too polite to say that it's also about you
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.040]   same thing happens here here we are here we are we're it's happening right now
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:54.480]   our show today brought to you by guess who amazon oh perfect this is something i have used because we
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:01.840]   had uh pill pack was a sponsor for a long time really great idea using technology to deliver
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:08.960]   uh prescription medications uh in the mail they used scanners to check make sure you got the right
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:13.840]   meds at the right time was really brilliant amazon bottom and they've incorporated this technology
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:19.440]   into something brand new which is amazon pharmacy now a lot of us are still staying home
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.600]   going to the pharmacy seems like if it has seemed all year like the most dangerous thing in the
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:29.680]   world you could do amazon pharmacy solves the problem it saves you time they work with your doctor
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:35.360]   and delivers medication to your door you get the meds you need without leaving the house one less
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:44.560]   errand more safety for you and it really is an amazing technology so it's it's absolutely uh
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.680]   easy to use your doctor's office could just send you next prescription straight to amazon pharmacy
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.440]   by the way they do something extra that your pharmacy may not be doing amazon pharmacy
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:57.840]   coordinates with your doctor to make sure it's accurate they're really focused on getting you
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:03.360]   exactly the right medication in the right dosage you can use your insurance of course amazon pharmacy
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.920]   works with almost all insurance plans nationwide of course it saves you time because you don't have
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:14.560]   to go to the pharmacy honestly i haven't been to the pharmacy in years i love this idea no more

[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:31.120]   it without insurance now as you as i mentioned it does take insurance but if what's great about
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.400]   amazon pharmacy and this is something no pharmacy does you know how many times if you go to pharmacy
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.560]   fill the prescription you don't know what the cost of it is until you're at the cash register and
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:46.400]   they say that'll be five hundred fifty four dollars please that is really scary with amazon pharmacy
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:52.160]   everything is up front the pricing is completely clear and understandable they will tell you
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:58.160]   what the cost of the medication is what your insurance copay is and if you're an amazon prime

[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.840]   of things we did on the on the geek cruises stand up and bow the ship and glacier bay and watch the
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.120]   uh so a neat one's the ice floating down the last day watch the glaciers calve it's really
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:05.760]   incredible ketchup can sit all of the all of the fun places um i did a geek cruise to alaska but
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:14.720]   it was a chess cruise interesting yeah it had uh there were like larry evans and the u.s champion
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:19.680]   had all these grandmasters on board they were have it's a weirdest thing because you're looking
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.160]   at the window as the glaciers go by but meanwhile there's 15 chess boards and we're doing a simultaneous
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.520]   and that's much more important than those glaciers who cares so it was really fun playing as castles
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:34.080]   and bishops yeah it was great it's very nerdy experience that's the nice thing about a cruise
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.960]   ship you can be as nerdy as you you really can be as nerdy as you want to be
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:45.680]   uh find out more at cruises.twit.tv five count them five bills so the house
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:54.960]   judiciary committee remember the the the tech CEOs coming and testifying the zuckerberg and dorsey
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:00.240]   that thing's also was on mute base was was just the same color as his drape so that's like plenty
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.520]   from just look like a floating line yeah nobody's sitting red
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:12.480]   they all testified this was part of a 16 month long investigation by the anti-trust
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:21.040]   committee of the house judiciary committee and now on friday five bills introduced in the house as
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.320]   a result of this investigation now the problem with saying that anything has been introduced
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.520]   they're bipartisan but the problem with saying anything's been introduced in congress is
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:35.360]   the house is one thing the senate is completely another and who knows if any of these have
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.520]   changed totally different totally different lobbyists you don't know who's getting money from
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:47.200]   what so uh davis isalini who is uh the chairman of the committee uh said in a statement our agenda
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.880]   will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest most powerful tech monopolies
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.120]   play by the same rules as the rest of us i think that's a giveaway that word wealthiest
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.000]   because i think some of this punishment is because they're too successful not because they're too
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.800]   powerful i'd like to hear powerful be the first word not the second word in that sentence do you
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.240]   remember that when the testimony though like it started off with him saying we have to investigate
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.720]   whether these companies need to be broken up and then nothing in the entire hearing had anything to
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.200]   do with breaking up the companies it was mostly concern over competition about whether they were
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.600]   mean to partners and competitors from the democrats and then like suppression of conservative speech
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.360]   from the republicans and then at the end you go thank you all for coming it is now evident we have
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.600]   to break up these companies yes the thing it's like there was zero conversation about break up in
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:37.760]   the entire section well and if anything they were complete the the agendas were completely
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.600]   different but they all have the same goal which is to spank these guys well it's it's the allos
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:47.680]   in wonderland thing where it's first sentence then trial yeah exactly so here are the five bills
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:54.080]   again who knows uh you know some of them i think are not a bad thing one empowers the justice
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:00.560]   department or the f t c two this one is going to never pass break up tech firms by forcing the sell
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:05.040]   off parts of their business that could create a conflict of interest that's like youtube from
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.920]   google was the example that's really challenging because you approved these mergers you said facebook
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.240]   could buy instagram you said facebook could buy what's up you said google could buy youtube it was
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.680]   all approved and now you're going to say oh yeah uh take back i think they can't list them in search
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.120]   right that's the other relief is that otherwise they can't list youtube in google well that's a
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.160]   different bill for consumers this is a bill that would bar company it's hard it's confusing because
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.040]   there's five oh there's another bill would bar companies from giving their own services preference
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:39.360]   over their rivals and of course google got in trouble for shopping and the the eu uh i don't think
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.840]   it's ever successfully demonstrated that google was favoring shopping but and it looks like if you do
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:50.640]   search google favors youtube and its search results maybe it's very hard to know and be even harder
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:59.200]   to enforce but since apple doesn't do search uh twitter doesn't do search facebook i don't know
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:04.080]   facebook favorites his own services in the search results i think it's really all actually do like
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:09.280]   if you put a video like a video from an out of platform service into any post you make on that
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.560]   platform whether like you put a youtube video on twitter you put a facebook video in it they're
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.640]   not gonna favor it they they're gonna down it will be actually decelerated like they will not show
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.680]   it to people because they don't want you leaving the platform yeah they're doing their uh they're
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:25.360]   doing their business anyway you could make that illegal i think that's really the purpose of antitrust
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.920]   and and congress in general is to force these companies to do something that may not be in their
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:35.440]   best interest but it is in the national interest is in society's interest that's the point right
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.720]   that's what laws are about you want to kill somebody that might be in your interest but it's not in our
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.840]   interest we don't want to let you do that um another bill would block companies like facebook this one
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.800]   i think has a better chance because it's uh it's looking ahead it would block companies like facebook
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:57.920]   from buying up nascent competitors so it's pretty clear from the testimony and the email and discovery
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.240]   that facebook knew that instagram and what's app we're going to be a threat to its business
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:07.120]   bought them they tried to buy snapchat for the same reason to keep them from being competitors
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.680]   so this would outlaw that that one i think has a
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:15.600]   leo if only the government had some sort of mechanism whereby it would improve purchases of
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.680]   companies by other companies already i can't believe we don't have that law it's all been
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.680]   defanged we do but it's all been defanged it's the federal law that could have stopped
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:29.840]   barn doors after the horses are backed yeah yeah 2021 but they're still approving those like literally
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:35.040]   this this year they're still approving those deals here's one that is uncontroversial
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.000]   because it raises government fees always a good thing and say it actually already passed the senate
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.120]   uh senator clobichars bill that would boost merger filing fees so if you're gonna
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:52.240]   uh get a government approval for a merger you have to pay filing fees that those fees would then go
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:59.200]   to having uh more antitrust enforcers so that's good you know uh you know fund the antitrust enforcement
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.480]   anyway uh and then the the final bill would force platform this is the one i i think we need but
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:09.040]   it's going to be challenging and you you brought up something uh rene on this one it would force
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:14.640]   platforms to make data interoperable so you could go from one service to another so if you had
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.440]   you know google kind of does this with takeout but to take out formats unless the other service
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:25.760]   understands jason um are that easy to import they're a lot easier to export yeah but there's a bigger
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.960]   argument i forget if it was benedict evidence or benedict one of the bands was bringing it up
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:33.280]   like who owns like if i like your instagram picture who owns that like if i email your gmail from my
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.720]   i cloud who owns that email where's my expectation of privacy and your expectation of data uh
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:44.560]   uh transport transport ability yeah i mean can we agree on at least some fundamental stuff that i
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:50.160]   for instance should be able to move my apple photos to google photos or vice versa yeah in this case
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.880]   you newton as you mentioned pointed out this week it seems like the big tech companies already know
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.440]   this is happening because they're already implementing these features and i think that's yeah absolutely
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.520]   you shouldn't say oh well if you want to get your photos out of our service you have to drag them
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.160]   out one by one you gotta there's got to be a button that you can say i need to cancel and i want all
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:13.280]   my stuff back like that's i think that's not an unreasonable thing that like that's an easy one
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.160]   i would hope so they did it for gdpr right like they had the app yeah data port abilities part of gdr
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:23.040]   that's right yeah so they're maybe they're already doing it yeah i don't know how to solve that
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.080]   problem such an Icarus thing like they these companies knew the stuff was coming for years and
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.440]   everybody's planter dot jason's written about it you know feel everybody's written about this
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.040]   for years and they were just flying closer and closer to the sun saying those governments are
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.840]   too you know the eu might try this the doj might try that and they were fearless they raced as far
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.280]   as they could to the line and showed no signs of slowing down and i think if they'd done just a
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.240]   little bit better risk mitigation they could have stopped a lot of these problems in their tracks
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.600]   and now they're doing the worst thing imaginable which is allowing the most tech unsavy self-interested
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.480]   easily bought off people in the world the people who while trying again like while trying to make
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:04.160]   a browser ballot to to save slept near and fenrear fenris they destroyed every web rendering edgian
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.880]   that we had like everybody now uses some flavor of hdml that's how good they are with these laws
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.720]   they're doing the same thing to everything else so i i wish these companies had been smarter
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.000]   five years ago or more prescient five years ago and yeah did a little bit humble
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.600]   yeah they're they're kind of not wired that way are they i think that they weren't paying
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.440]   attention for a long time and then they also figured that they're so powerful and that they're so far ahead
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:34.960]   of law drafting right like the any law that gets drafted is going to be playing it's skating to
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.160]   where the puck is and not where it's going to be i think i think that that may still be true i think
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:46.800]   that they're they have some reason to have this confidence level that even these suggested laws
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:53.600]   i'm not entirely sure a lot of them will do what they think it will do or solve the problems they
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.240]   think it will solve it as too bad that we get so cynical about governance because it's kind of
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:04.640]   important but it also gets it's a competent yeah well it's also very easy to say you know half of
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.600]   these are proposed just because they make good press releases there with zero expectation they'll
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.800]   ever become law well the approving the mergers is the one that kills me as like they'll say it's the
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.360]   the barn door is closed after the horse is gone like what they're saying is all our existing
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:24.240]   enforcement is so corrupt or incompetent right we're gonna do we have to spell it out for you
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.560]   as congress and the answer is yes apparently you do have to spell it out didn't they with the
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:34.480]   AT&T time Warner merger just like a few months ago say yeah we shouldn't have approved that was a
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:42.560]   bad idea what were we thinking how big that one should be fired what it was me well ironically the
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:49.440]   acquiring companies are suffering their own uh pain or so sure everybody agrees all of the content
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.000]   that it bought because boy that was a bad idea the market is spoken one of the worst parts for me
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.080]   was like i watched all of that testimony and you had people there spouting these cockamamie theories
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:04.960]   like something like our our speeches being suppressed when the top 10 articles on facebook are like
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.000]   exactly about you and the things that you're complaining about you have zero suppression going
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.720]   on there but they argued that over and over again and then very briefly every once in a while
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:18.080]   that veneer would fade and they would become like this the sharpest most sincere most accurate
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.720]   best attorney in the world and completely deflate one argument after another and then they go back
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.040]   to their circus act so it's not like they actually believe this stuff they're doing all this theater
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.280]   to the detriment of actual regulation because they know it's better for their personal power
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.840]   when they're fully capable of actually reasonably and rationally prosecuting these things
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:44.320]   now i'm just a crass into me oh well at least tiktok lives on
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:51.680]   biden has uh revoked the trump ban on tiktok and we chat although he uh the president did say he's
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:56.640]   going to have the secretary of commerce look into whether these chinese-owned companies are a threat
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.600]   in some way i don't know how you solve that one this is really tricky well you have to figure out
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.440]   what they're doing with all this what the data what's happening in the data collecting and or the
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.000]   algorithms yeah exactly yeah i heard an interesting conversation speaking of john grouber i think it
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.960]   was john grouber and vintomsons podcast and they were talking about the power of these platforms
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:20.320]   facebook and twitter is that they build these algorithms up and then they walk away and they sort
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   of say well we're not really responsible it's just the algorithm but they wrote the algorithm and
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:30.240]   one of their fault one of them said well what happens when somebody who is potentially a malicious
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.440]   intent can control that algorithm and control what people see and they didn't say it and i'm sitting
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.320]   there listening to this saying like tiktok right because that that's the argument here is that you
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:48.240]   get a source like tiktok that's completely algorithm driven and is through the caiman islands or wherever
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.360]   else run by a chinese company that's essentially under the auspices of the chinese government and
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:59.280]   you know whoever runs that algorithm can control what every tiktok user sees and what they don't see
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.360]   and it's really powerful isn't it and it's super powerful and it knows about human nature and
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:10.080]   about human psychology and the danger isn't just an unrestrained and unconsidered algorithm the
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:15.760]   danger is that somebody says now we can use this but to do whatever i'm more afraid of mark zucker
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:21.120]   bird doing that than i am of president she i mean i you know i think she president she could completely
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.480]   do it but i because he's been caught several times over again i mean honestly the enemy might be within
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.880]   it's not necessarily a foreign power i ops member he was like trying to use the news feed to make
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.560]   us sad and see what that would just see what happens like again he keeps getting caught i don't think
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.680]   marks immoral but i do think he's kind of a moral and an engineering kind of way you know and i
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:45.200]   don't know how you speaking about legislation i don't know how you legislate the creation of algorithms
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:50.880]   to curate content that's really tough that is next level for for a bunch of politicians who are in
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.680]   their sixties and seventies and have their i don't care if they're 25 i don't think they would yeah but i
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.320]   like i'm saying is there are multiple levels removed from even remotely understanding those
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:06.480]   issues well let's say you got a um uh uh technology savvy congress
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:12.000]   in there i don't know what they would do anyway right and they probably all worked for those
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.720]   companies at some point right yeah so it's this is the other like and there's also real world
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.960]   challenges like i know like one of the things youtube is facing now is like who determines
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:27.280]   what an expert is and you have people who are bird kernels start generals special operators
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.680]   uh medical professors just like board certified medical professionals doctors lawyers all these
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.800]   people espousing incredibly extreme fringe theories on youtube like in videos that are
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.480]   convincing people about landish outlandish counter facts or made up stories and youtube takes those
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.680]   videos now and they go on twitter and say you know i'm this person i'm this i'm an expert they're
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.440]   not letting my video up and youtube's like we need a hundred of you to agree before we can let that
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.720]   like how do they determine veracity how do they deter like a lot of things an algorithm by itself
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.680]   can't really determine for you except popularity and their nightmare is hard to arrive from i don't
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.600]   know if tiktok struggles with this but i think facebook struggles with it trying to figure out
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:09.360]   how to do this right they created that oversight board uh you know partly is an exercise to to
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:14.800]   you know rush off responsibility but yeah but they said they're gonna adhere to it the oversight
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.560]   board said yeah well but the but okay so i think this is an example of the oversight board working
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:26.800]   they said okay it was okay to ban president trump but it wasn't okay to do it without a limit on how
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:33.600]   long the band is so facebook came back and said all right the ban will be two years and uh now this
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:40.480]   is going to be the tricky part pending on whether we consider him an ongoing threat in on january 7th
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:49.440]   2020 what is it 2024 no 2023 we will reinstate him of course that little middle part whether he's
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:55.280]   an ongoing threat is going to be very challenging for them but it but it at least they responded to
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.840]   perhaps legitimate chrisp for the oversight board and said okay you say we should have a limit this
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:05.600]   is what we're going to do right that that that sort of worked that's a kind of governance yeah up
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:09.680]   until the point where they don't want to follow the rules and then they just won't right it's just
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.880]   have to really apple announced last week a change to their app store review policy where
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.920]   they're adding another layer of appeal so that if you get rejected you can appeal it to a higher
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.600]   power and now there's apparently another higher power you get rejected three times if you want
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:28.000]   and i thought you know fill yeah but in the end it's all people at apple telling you whether you
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.200]   could your app like on one level it seems very weird like perhaps apple should have an internal
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:39.920]   system that allows weird things to bubble up to instead of using some sort of formal appeals
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.880]   process but regardless it's not like you're going to a neutral arbiter here you're just going to
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.120]   somebody else who works the next cubicle over and asking for a different opinion the other
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.440]   thing the government is struggling with all of us are struggling with is ransomware
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:59.600]   it is a challenge for sure and it's becoming more of a challenge it's the
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.440]   Christopher Ray the head of the FBI said it's a challenge equivalent to the challenge we faced in
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:10.960]   9/11 the implication is its nation states attacking us it's not just you know random bad guys
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:18.240]   i don't know you know he knows better than we do he probably has intelligence but that's a
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.880]   but what do you what do you think what are what
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:29.040]   can the government do anything about ransomware no no no they can't um it's it's
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:39.600]   it's um the problem with the the cyber crime is that it always seems the cyber criminals are
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:46.800]   one step ahead of everyone else different from different from uh crime in the the physical world
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:53.440]   where uh the was funny we at least and i were watching a movie the other night about robbing
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:18:00.640]   um armored cars they thought well that's pretty antiquated yeah why would you rob an armored car
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.280]   when with a couple of lines of code you can get much more money uh completely risk free
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:12.240]   who needs guns anymore so any smart criminal is now as long abandoned the i do people still
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.800]   rob armored cars is that still going on i'm sure that they do there's still plenty of dumb criminals
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.800]   yeah don't worry much of bitcoin cars bunch of armed car robbers still got learning to code yeah
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:26.720]   they need to code learn the code join it you don't even that's the beauty of this you don't even
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.520]   have to learn to code because the ransomware has been written for you it's ransomware as a service
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:38.240]   that's what almost all ransomware attacks now are is just script kitties uh you know saying oh
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:44.880]   yeah i'm gonna use you to attack this company uh okay fine give us 10 percent by the way the cut
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:49.680]   the as far as i could tell the cut that the ransomware authors are asking is lower than apple's cut
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:57.520]   just i just want a little point of information there um but who's kind of
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.280]   you can use our ransomware for 15 percent but they can't wait to see what you'll do with it
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:06.880]   our ransomware is thinner lighter and faster than ever before actually it's terrible by the
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:11.600]   way the decryptors apparently the colonial pipeline they paid millions of dollars to the
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:17.280]   ransomware authors uh dark side it got the decryptor and it was so slowly threw it away they said
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.760]   we can't use this we're gonna do it ourselves visual base
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:28.240]   i think i think steve gibson looked into it and it was like very poor code because there's no
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:33.840]   incentive for them to write good code to decrypt right but at least if you know what the decryption
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.240]   code does you could build your own decryption code to do it exactly once they get the keys the uh he
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.520]   said you know steve can do it in a sampler well clearly they know how to do it because the encryption
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:49.360]   is almost instant so why is the decryption slow so slow if they don't care right they know how to do
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:55.680]   it yeah the us did get money back this is actually an interesting uh mystery we don't know exactly
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:02.000]   how law enforcement recovered two point three million dollars in bitcoin paid after the colonial
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.680]   pipeline attack money paid by the colonial pipeline to the ransomware hackers it's not completely clear
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:14.480]   how they did it they seized about sixty four bitcoin from a virtual wallet they just looked at the ledger
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.200]   please say they just looked at the ledger that would be great i think some people think all the
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:25.120]   fbi's figured out how to you know to decrypt the i don't think so on the blockchain they just
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:30.080]   looked at the link i hear they knew they knew as a cat it was and i think that the smart people are
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:36.960]   thinking it was a so when you when you do bitcoin you can do it one of two ways i foolishly decided to
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.160]   manage my own wallet and of course i immediately forgot the password so i can't get into it or
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:48.080]   you could even more foolishly in my opinion uh go to somebody like uh coin base or
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.880]   mount gox and have a custodial wallet where they have access they control your wallet
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.960]   you can move stuff in and out of it they can move stuff in an avenue for you uh the problem
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.560]   with the custodial wallet is you have to trust these people in the case of mount gox that was a
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.760]   mistake right they took the money and ran so i decided not to do it also get subpoenaed
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:10.640]   and they could get subpoenaed and we think that that's actually what happened is that the uh the
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:15.040]   ransom where you'll remember the password and you'll retire you're living on a beach or any 20
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:20.240]   percent unfortunately that was my thinking was i'm glad i can't get into my wallet because the
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.640]   bitcoin keeps going up if i had gotten into it i would have sold it for a thousand bucks and i'd be
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:30.160]   uh you know it would have been worse i figured by the time you know quantum computers come along and
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:35.920]   i can crack that password yeah i'll be uh we worth billions the richest 90 year old on pledge
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.440]   this is a strange check out investments only have it go up
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.880]   well i uh unfortunately i might have been wrong about that on the other hand if i'd bought game
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.640]   stop i would have been happy hmm why is game stop going up again
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:56.240]   any thoughts are you stop i thought everyone had really gone on this on amc the new one right
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.800]   stock of the day i'm i've got a step to date on my meme stocks games game stop is up
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:08.720]   five point eight percent uh yesterday to two hundred or sad or friday i guess two hundred
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:14.080]   thirty three bucks you know if i could bring this whole segment to a summary the internet
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:23.120]   was a mistake yes computers were a mistake there you're right amc was up i really think it's
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:28.240]   fifteen point three nine percent so you're right but that was for act there was actual news
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.840]   on uh on amc there's a lot of it's got to be it's got to be because mutual friend of the
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.280]   shelf dave whiskers won an entire game spot on mr beast last week that's got to have
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:43.920]   oh wow that mr beast likes to give away the the loot doesn't it stores all the whole stores
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:50.560]   wow let's take a little break more to come those of you who tuned in thinking i there was a guy
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.160]   actually the chairman said hey call me when they're done talking about apple because uh i'm gonna
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:59.760]   go watch the western club show yeah yeah they did but it was on an iphone he didn't answer
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:05.280]   what is he gonna be doing to call me he's gonna come back and we're gonna be talking apple again

[01:25:49.840 --> 01:26:01.760]   looks like something bad happened previously on twit all about android one and a half years after
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.440]   the very first like the initial launch of stadia already a year and a half later
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:16.480]   support is finally coming to android tv in an official sense why the heck was this not done sooner
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:24.160]   mac break weekly i really liked this new quick note feature yeah idea that you pull up from the
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.000]   core wide left i knew no i can't watch that goes another tingos automatically yeah but is also
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:37.360]   attached to the app that you created the note sticky note that seems very useful and very interesting
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:45.920]   tech news weekly more than 800 arrests worldwide are now tied to an fbi operation that europool
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:50.720]   called one of the largest and most sophisticated law enforcement operations to date and they
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:58.560]   surreptitiously and secretly ran their own encrypted phone company deliberately selling it to criminals
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:06.400]   who basically run a very large scale encryption honeypot to it technology isn't always pretty
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:12.960]   but we are i hope you saw all that and if you didn't we'll make sure you tune in this week because
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:20.080]   there's lots more good stuff in the store we are going to cover the new windows windows 11
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:29.040]   goes to 11 goes to 11 goes to 11 june 24th which is a thursday which is kind of a weird day to do
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:35.200]   announcements on thursday june 24th paul tharotten mary jofoli from windows weekly will join me
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.920]   will stream the launch of wind we don't know what the name of it is but it's getting more and more
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.880]   clear from the little tweets and stuff that it's going to be windows 11 and then we'll do windows
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.320]   weekly shortly after that we have paul nary jot time to file her stories and then we'll gather
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.280]   regather for windows weekly so that's moving not next not this week but next week it's moving
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:02.720]   to thursday right after the uh microsoft announcement weird do you cover windows right philip these
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.560]   guys don't know nothing about windows i'm gonna ask you a little bit i have people who do that for
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:13.200]   i have the best way to cover windows exactly uh but we'll we'll be covering that as well with the
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.720]   firewall it's they said never 11 right leo they said like 10 was going to be their platform for
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:23.840]   the future well so we if you really care about this stuff you should be watching windows weekly on
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.760]   wednesday's with paul mary jot but apparently microsoft never said this is the last version of
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:35.520]   windows just some pion said it and microsoft never corrected it it was somebody from microsoft but he
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.240]   said it like at some meeting somewhere and and it suddenly spread his wildfire but it was never
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:46.720]   really so microsoft never officially said windows 10 that's it it's all over um it is kind of
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.760]   right on the timeline it's been about five years since windows 10 that release a new one but
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:29:00.160]   the real question is what it could possibly be uh and paul and mary jot keep telling me calm down
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:06.000]   it's not going to be anything great deep integration of game pass that is the only thing i really want
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.400]   from windows the biggest thing you're you're actually not far off the biggest thing is there's
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:18.560]   going to be a new windows store that's the big thing direct direct x 37 direct x 37 so i don't
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.840]   know is that unfair i mean apple announced macOS monoray it's not a huge difference from but apple
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.440]   does this kind of every year microsoft's been updating windows every other you know twice a year every
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.440]   six months but it's been weird like they've had different names for them in different timelines
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.240]   and it's felt a bit cockamamie like what are we going to call this one some of them will have
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.760]   weird names some will have like very pedestrian like windows allow at least something we can
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:45.040]   understand yeah anyway it's getting back to the basics yeah just give it a number and and move on
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:52.400]   yes the real creator creator release so it was one of those they they announced uh shortly before
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.760]   this they were not going to do windows 10x which was an interesting kind of rethinking of windows a
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:03.200]   simpler cleaner windows perhaps more secure how many times is that that microsoft is backed away
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.840]   from a rethinking of those never never gonna do it it's gonna be it's gonna be in the windows
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:13.120]   rt retirement yeah i remember they uh they were gonna do uh long horn i mean this you right that
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:19.600]   story has gone on for years and did they not um suspend the device that they were gonna
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:24.640]   primarily the neo yeah the neo yeah which is the dual screen device they did the duo but instead
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:30.160]   of putting windows on it they put and right on it right and then they initially said 10x is for two
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:36.160]   screen devices put and right in the first one and then killed the second one so then they killed 10x
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.480]   surface prox i think they still have that right they didn't they didn't discontinue that i
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:46.640]   hey yeah i mean i don't know i don't follow it that closely i so 10x is not going to happen
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:53.280]   but microsoft says features of 10x will make it their way into windows um i really thought windows
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:00.800]   was due for a kind of revamping to be more secure get rid of win 32 really lock it down a little bit
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:07.760]   more you know i don't think it's fair mit technology review says uh that the problem with ransome
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.960]   where is a governmental problem because we ignored it for four years under trump Steve Gibson i also
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:19.760]   don't think it's fair said the problem with ransome where is windows period it's such crappy bug ridden
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:24.800]   insecure software that you know if we didn't have to use that we wouldn't have the problem
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.520]   i'm not sure that's completely if all of these are some slightly true right they're running windows
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:35.280]   98 still that's the issue that's exactly it is the the challenge is that it's not microsoft security
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:41.280]   profile today it's microsoft security profile 20 plus years ago that's still running software in
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.080]   places that are important which is just bananas but not the the metaphorical bananas not the real
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:54.960]   banana okanawa banana well and also you know i every patch tuesday there's roughly on the order of
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:32:00.720]   a hundred fixes and if all of them were for legacy code i'd say okay great they're just going through
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:05.440]   the code fixing it when there's a problem they fix it but they are introducing new flaws as well
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:14.400]   unfortunately so that so that's not it um i don't know i feel i feel like so what paul and mary joke
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:20.160]   said and i hope this isn't true i really hope that windows 11 is as microsoft has said every
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.600]   time the most secure version of windows ever just like apple says the thinnest i've ever made
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:30.560]   well you wouldn't want this one's not as secure as last time but you know it's
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.520]   it's secure actually you don't want him to tell the truth but i think the real
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:39.920]   point of this according to paul mary joe and this is very disappointing to me is that
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:49.040]   to juice pc sales the for years the only reason people upgraded windows is when they bought a new
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:54.880]   pc that's how you get the new windows right most you and i but we tech enthusiasts maybe we go out
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:58.720]   and we get the nest the new version of windows but most people they use the version of windows that
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.760]   came with their pc and they only get a new version when they get a new pc so microsoft according to
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:09.760]   paul and mary joe who probably should know better than anybody microsoft says well we had a good year
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:14.560]   in pcs last year because of the pandemic but it's going to be a terrible year everybody was going
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:20.880]   to buy a pc for their kid got one we got to do something about it i know a new version of windows
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:27.600]   everybody will go to the store to buy a new pc is that incredible maybe they should get a video
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:32.240]   with like the friends reunions big did they get the friends back to do a windows 11 video
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:39.920]   back uh jennifer aniston and marcy perry was that for windows 95 or 95 because
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:47.440]   there's no bigger stars in the galaxy than the friends everything old is new again bring them back
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:51.440]   yeah to go back to what you're saying though i mean like the the ransomware is an economic
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.280]   crime it just becomes so lucrative that they can afford to put resources behind making the
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:00.080]   ransomware and any security system that involves humans is flawed in some way or another because
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.960]   they can make it really secure and then you'll get somebody to go i'm going to remove all this
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:08.560]   there's always if there's incentive it'll happen is what you're saying yeah well i honestly if you
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:15.280]   want to blame something for ransomware blame bitcoin ransomware was around before cryptocurrencies
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:21.600]   but remember they would say go down to the 7/11 and buy some uh what do they what do they call those
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:26.960]   little cut iTunes gift cards gift cards and send them to us it was it was really a you know a kind
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:32.640]   of minor problem at that time one step above like drop the money in a bag in this trash can at the
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:35.920]   corner of the corner because there was no good payment scheme and as soon as cryptocurrency
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:40.720]   became widespread enough that you could actually expect the victim to use it ransomware blossom so
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.120]   i'm blaming bitcoin for environmental disaster can i really blame them for both is it yeah blame
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:52.720]   bitcoin for everything it's all bitcoins fault uh no the bitcoin bros are going to hate me now
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.920]   i'm in deep trouble they hate you they hate coin it's not safe right dogecoin i can't blame dogecoin
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:04.560]   anyway we'll find out june 24th windows 11 i remember when windows 7 came out
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:10.800]   michael stuff set out party packs i got one had a remember that john you were supposed to have a
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.840]   launch party in your home and they sent out it's like streamers and balloons and i had playing
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.880]   cards it said windows 7 it was like i don't i don't know if it worked but it was really did you
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:26.000]   not be safe was that windows xp 95 was start me up that was the last windows launch that i think
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.400]   people really got excited about and that was for good reason lined up for that 95 was a big
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.720]   sleep forward i think i went to the windows 2000 launch and they had
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:43.520]   santana there to play that's pretty good the the the matchbox 20 songs that everyone was again no
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.920]   greater stars in the galaxy yeah did they give people free you two songs for the windows amule
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:55.600]   so and the other thing that's happened is microsoft in the days of windows 2000 and windows nt
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:00.560]   had really two versions of windows they had 98 95 the consumer version which is yeah unsec
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:06.240]   unsec you know if you if you forgot your password on windows 98 no problem just hit return and
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:12.320]   you're in and then they had nt which was designed for enterprise and was much more secure uh
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:17.200]   with xp microsoft kind of unified those units kernel right we hope it's all going to be nt from
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:23.760]   now on now i'm told again by the experts paul mary joe that we're gonna have another fork in the
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:29.680]   road where we have windows 11 a consumer version of windows and windows 10 a business version of
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.640]   here's okay hey apple guy is going to talk about microsoft so everybody just gather around good
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:40.800]   the challenge microsoft has is not that they're not smart and not that they're not creative and
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:46.240]   not that they don't want to nuke good people i have seen over the last decade plus so many
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:52.000]   really good products yes come out of microsoft get announced by microsoft the problem is that
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   microsoft has such market share and such legacy and has to maintain this existing pool of users
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.960]   that every time they try to escape their own gravity pulls them back like i was at the d conference
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:13.920]   when they announced their touch interface that was metro at the time right and i thought oh my god
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.440]   they got it they figured it out they're gonna they're gonna blow the iPad out of the water this is
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.440]   gonna be amazing and like a year later they're like no forget it forget actually in that demo
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:27.200]   they're like no no don't worry if you press this button it's just excel it's like guys you were
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.840]   right there it's so close but they can't and so i i feel for my head a phone because windows
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.800]   phone was a great phone yeah i really liked windows it was a great operating system the people at
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:42.400]   microsoft are so smart and so good at making this stuff the challenges that they've got their existing
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.640]   support channel and sales channel and their legacy hardware partners legacy and that actually
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:54.000]   surface being such a good product line surface is an example of out of microsoft almost that apple
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.120]   microsoft breaking out and saying what if we made our own hardware and it's like yes and it's good
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.000]   yes be be more like apple microsoft but they can't they kind of can't they do and Paul says this
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.320]   all the time they have apple and big big time they totally do yeah which is a mistake but they also
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.880]   can't advertise against their own oem so they advertise against apple and people just look at
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.880]   it but i don't want apple i don't care if it's my phone or my mind windows like why should i
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:21.280]   buy you instead of a del and i think it's i think it's more of a tragedy than a point in laugh i'm
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:25.680]   not pointing it laughing no it is a tragedy because i think that they have done some amazing stuff
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.720]   and it's almost like their customers and their partners won't let them i've said this before and
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.560]   i i really think it's true because such an adele came from the azure division he is very much a
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:40.960]   cloud guy and he's already kind of reposition the company ultimately you want to fix ransomware
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.280]   you want to fix security you want to fix this legacy problem you don't run windows on-prem
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:52.640]   you run windows in the cloud and i think ultimately that's going to be what happens it's going to be
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:59.520]   windows virtual desktop it's going to be windows from the data center let let microsoft handle it yeah
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.520]   windows when and they actually offer this as a product that's expensive right now they have
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.800]   supposedly been talking about launching something this year that's windows desktop in the cloud and
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.640]   i think that that's really they can make christina warren ceo because she just wouldn't care she would
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:17.360]   just push all the stuff through she could run out care at all she doesn't care no legacy is definitely
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:22.320]   the the millstone around their neck that's always kept them from and that's what's been always been
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:27.760]   great about apple is they're willing to say to their users sorry yeah it's over get out of there
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:31.840]   soft was like desperate to keep windows like but microsoft made that classic blender thinking
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.600]   windows was their business and not their product where apple was like we don't need the ipod anymore
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.040]   we have the iphon we don't need the mac anymore the ipag oh well we'll let them fight it out that's
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:43.040]   fine and microsoft especially under balmer was so everything had to be windows and nothing could
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.680]   challenge windows and he scuttled three or four a mate like from the courier to their experiment i
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.840]   forget the name of that experimental operating system he just kept killing every bit of of
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.480]   in beautiful innovation that came out of that company for a decade and we thought that we escaped
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.200]   when the della took over and when panels penitook over more and more things but they to Jason's
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.600]   point they still have that gravity they can't escape their enterprise windows legacy yeah and
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:09.120]   if they did cut the cord and make a brand new version of windows that did everything they wanted
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:14.000]   it to do but wasn't really backward compatible what would have happened is that nobody would
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.080]   upgrade to it and everybody would use old versions of windows that are broken and insecure forever
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:25.760]   so like they they can't force their users it's it's just a fascinating thing but i think what's
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:30.000]   amazing about it is they keep trying to be as creative as they possibly can be
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.520]   and i give them full credit for that it's just it's a struggle for them except the xbox they have
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.240]   like relative freedom on that it's amazing no they've done very well yeah yeah because there they say
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:46.160]   oh they don't have you you need to buy a new xbox now yes so good or game pass so good
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.040]   if you guys watched the uh Netflix series was originally a crackle series called startup
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:57.280]   no no i just started watching it but somebody told me that season two in fact i'm wishing i could
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:06.000]   find a synopsis for season two uh involves the fbi coming up with a in encrypted messaging program
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:13.680]   that they convince the bad guys to use totally plausible oh man did that inspire the fbi i'm
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:20.240]   wondering because we're now learning that anom which was the fbi australian sting was thought up
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:28.400]   a year later in 2018 just the fbi get crackle did they get crackle did they get crackle why don't
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:34.720]   we just do that it was either that or they were going to put comedians in cars and have them get
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:41.040]   coffee yeah it could have been one or the other they were close with both um so the apparently was
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:49.040]   over drinks with the uh australian federal police uh they came up with this idea of
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:55.360]   uh they conceptualized according to anom was the result of like-minded and passion
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:01.120]   passionate individuals in the afp and fbi thinking differently to solve the common problem of the
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:08.000]   use of encrypted communications for criminals the individuals did conceptualize some of this over
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.520]   a beer from there they worked on a plan they they could work and was legal and resembled
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:19.920]   strikingly resembled a uh show on crackle uh which had been aired the year before no i added that
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:27.040]   part so anom is a fascinating story though because the the trick was how do we get the bad guys to use
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:33.920]   these this encrypted messenger how do we get them to trust it by the time they pulled the plug on
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:41.440]   june seventh last week nine thousand encrypted devices were in circulation they hundreds of arrests
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:48.880]   were made and uh it turns out that they did a couple of things which were brilliant for one
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:54.960]   thing they charged two thousand dollars to use this every six months they made it really expensive
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:00.320]   which apparently if you're a bad guy you go wow this has got to be good it's like a
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:05.600]   gold encrusted iPhone yeah it's got to be good the other thing they did is they made it you can't get
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:15.360]   an anom unless you are referred invited by somebody else just like clubhouse you got to get an invite
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:21.200]   and so it was one drug dealer inviting another drug dealer again reassuring the crooks oh this
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:26.880]   must be good because uh pin swapping and Joey Joey grenade balls grada flowy says this is the best
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:33.840]   but the best thing they did was they got a quote significant crime figure in the middle east
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:41.120]   uh an australian born a guy who's now in uh by the way is it skipped bail and cypress he's now in
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:49.360]   his temple they can't get him named joseph hakan ayeek he was patient zero with anom they got him
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:57.680]   i don't know how they got him to use it and recommend it and hey if ayeek's using it
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:05.200]   it's got to be good the funny thing is they're now saying apparently he's leading a lavish lifestyle
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:11.840]   and Istanbul should he use borat would have been wasted yeah the uh australian police force uh
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:17.520]   spokes was in ryan says ayeek's use of the device was perceived and is an endorsement and the platform
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:25.040]   grew exponentially from there now the australian police you're saying ayeek everybody thinks you
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:31.520]   set them up so you should turn yourself in because if we don't get you they're gonna get you for your
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:39.520]   own safety you should give yourself up um you know i would be celebrating this they arrested a lot of
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:47.040]   people they broke up a lot of uh rings of criminals of all kinds um you know it's it was a real
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:52.640]   success story except that that that key line because we can't break encrypted communications
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:57.200]   we're going to do our own i'm really a worried that this is going to become
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:04.080]   the proof that the fbi and austrian federal police and others want to say i've been trying over and
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:07.840]   over again to break encryption well interestingly the week after this happened they introduced a new
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:15.280]   bill in the australian uh parliament or whatever it's called to uh to say you need a backdoor we need
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:22.720]   a backdoor but clearly they don't they just need do you need ayeek ayeek to do their fitting and
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.680]   apparently this all happened because somebody there was a tip given to somebody on a blog who said
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:34.000]   all that anom stuff is going through the u.s and they verified it and that blog post has since
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.880]   been deleted but that was when that's how it apparently that is when the arrests began so why
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.000]   not be doing it forever exactly they had to pull the plug at them interesting the anom this is from
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.760]   a story on computer weekly began slowing is spreading slowly in australia the phones were
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:52.880]   sold through word of mouth recommendations passed on by a network of criminal distributors set up
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:58.400]   by the fbi's informant we don't know who the informant was i probably was not a yeek but maybe
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.960]   sales took off during the summer of 2019 has demand increased both in style australia from
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:08.160]   other countries stuff spread it's it's a viral this is like a viral hit of our lives and some
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:13.760]   aggressive you guys never have used that very users in europe pay to fee of around a thousand
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:17.120]   to fifteen hundred dollar euros for a six-month subscription paid in
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:26.640]   bitpoint uh here's uh here's an example um conversation of an encrypted message on anom
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:32.480]   uh i have a cargo ship with the captain on side two they want to throw over load as they leave
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.960]   so once the tugboats release the pilot boat guides them out to see once pilot boat leaves
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:42.960]   we message saying throw they'll throw right away can you do this if so what's your fee oh yeah they
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:48.320]   could definitely catch it they charge twenty dollar dorphy twenty percent dorphy so these are
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:54.160]   the kinds of conversations they were they were just wide open imminent threats resulted in automated
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:47:00.640]   alert to investigation teams within the afp and law enforcement parties partners uh to start
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:07.440]   those arrests um wow what a story you know in one way it's just a really great sting
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:13.760]   well done maybe a Netflix show soon yeah art imitates life imitates art the fbi under us law is
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:20.560]   not permitted to monitor communications of us citizens so they so if if you are a use at us user
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:26.800]   you but this is why they got the afp involved right they couldn't monitor you but the australian
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:34.480]   federal police could so just five eyes it right over yeah so that's interesting um
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:41.360]   they use the telecommunications and other legislation amendment the assistant and access act of 2018
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:47.120]   to allow these law enforcement agencies in australia to order technology companies to assist
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:53.840]   secretly that brings us to the apple story where the apparently the department of justice
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:03.600]   uh subpoenaed apple and uh was at google also um microsoft for information about uh democrats
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.640]   well not just democrats uh they're using app for the account today please don't yeah who else uh
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:15.920]   don mcdonald oh don mcgane yeah the white house council under trump was also surveilled by trumps
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.680]   justice department and his wife and his wife and his wife and the gag order just
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:26.160]   expired and apple and notified them may fifth yeah and so apple said well we couldn't tell you then
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:31.760]   because uh that's how the law works in the united states is a gag order of federal judge
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.960]   said you cannot disclose the subpoena i guess that makes sense you don't want to tell the bad
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:43.520]   guys that they're being observed um apple said we complied but once that gag order expired may
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:50.320]   fifth they told everybody including don mcgane uh eric saw swallwell of california uh on the
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:55.600]   house intelligence chairman adam shiff and others in the intelligence committee ostensibly uh looking
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:02.400]   it was a federal grand jury that issued the the uh subpoena looking for leaks uh although i don't
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:09.200]   know why you would uh surveil the president's uh council because they thought he was the leaker
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:15.360]   yeah maybe he might guess yeah and he might have been yeah um apple said we regularly challenge
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:20.640]   warrants subpoenas and non-disclosure orders and have made it our policy to inform affected
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.160]   customers of government and requests about them just as soon as possible in this case
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:29.440]   there was a non-disclosure order signed by a federal magistrate provided no information on
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:33.760]   the information the investigation and it would have been virtually impossible for apple to understand
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:38.720]   the intent of the desired information without digging through users accounts consistent with
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:42.480]   the request apple limited the information provided to account subscriber information
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:47.760]   and did not provide content such as emails or pictures so it's metadata but we do know that
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.640]   metadata can be very useful in this who's talking to who when you know you could put together a lot
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:59.440]   um it believes other tech companies received a similar orders microsoft told cnbc that they
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:07.440]   had received a similar subpoena from the doj in 2017 the doj's watch dog is currently investigating
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.960]   the probe to see whether it was politically motivated
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:18.400]   which it might have been might not might not but anyway uh this is going to happen all the time
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.440]   apple has to obey the laws of the land it's in including by the way china yeah sure
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:31.760]   hey it it it's it's weird to me i i understand apple has to do what it has to do with subpoenas
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:38.080]   and they disclose them when they can at the same time that you're you're you're doing the the
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:43.520]   privacy is a fundamental human right it's a little contradictory it's a little contradictory i
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:51.120]   feel that they need to put an asterisk in there somehow or or or some sort of caveats it's it just
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:57.200]   it is residents of russia china and bellowers are not in towards your own knowledge it feels like
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:03.760]   it it's something that apple has to address in a serious way if they're going to make privacy
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:10.560]   part of their um their big push well maybe apple says you know we believe in privacy to the extent
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:16.640]   and federal laws allow i mean i think the challenge is and and you saw this in the san
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.480]   bernadino shooting right is like apple they did a good job fighting it right i can engineer
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:25.600]   they could try to engineer more and more of their product to be unreachable by subpoena but they also
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:31.520]   know the further they go down that path the more they risk laws being passed that demand that they
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:36.800]   not engineer their products to be that level of security so that that's part of the challenge
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:42.400]   here but it's true it it you know we value your privacy but if a judge doesn't then you know there's
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.880]   your asterisk is in there somewhere if the judge says no then we have to give them all your it's
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.280]   hard for any i'm not going to give apple a pass but it's hard for any multinational company to
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:56.080]   exist in this environment perfect example apple just released its supplier report in which they
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:59.360]   said you know we're really doing our best for making sure there's no child labor blah blah blah
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:05.760]   information just had a story came out on tuesday that some apple suppliers in china are telling
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:11.520]   ethnic minorities don't bother applying for jobs if you're a muslim or a weager uh don't apply for
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:16.560]   jobs we're not going to hire you of course then there's also the accusation that they use weager
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:23.600]   slave labor and some of these suppliers as well so i'm not sure um you know this is this this is
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:32.720]   tough and i feel like i i'm gonna believe apple when it says that it's got a set of standards i
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:37.840]   think the challenge here is that they're playing whack-a-mole yeah a whole bunch of players that they cannot
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:42.000]   tear themselves away from plus it's the suppliers to the suppliers to the suppliers is a chain all
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.320]   the way down and so a report comes out and they're like oh okay well i guess we'll have to tell them
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:51.120]   not to do that too and then there'll be something else that happens and i think the big picture here
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:56.560]   is just that apple is producing so much of its product line in china at this point and it doesn't
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:02.400]   really have very many alternatives and so it's kind of yeah it's stuck it's it's it's hoised by its own
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:07.040]   patart here yeah here a couple of examples from wane maus article and the information one
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:13.680]   april job ad from uh beel crystal a company that makes iphone cover glass says quote Tibetans
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:22.080]   weegers we yi dongxiang from Tibet or shinjong regions not accepted another example for cathais
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:28.000]   tatming which makes stamp metal parts for iphone said minorities without dietary restrictions are
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:35.680]   accepted weegers excluded and on and on the information said more than 30 of the 100 online
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:41.600]   job ads uh most of which were posted within the last 18 months explicitly mentioned the posts
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:47.280]   were related to apple work but because some of the suppliers work for other brands besides apple
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:53.360]   they left out anything that that didn't mention apple right so it may also be that apple has
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:59.360]   certain standards and what that means is they're like okay you know over here is the apple stuff
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:02.720]   we'll follow this standard yeah and then the rest of us will have a factory we're just gonna run
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:07.360]   our factory with the whatever yeah and apple is responsible for such a huge part of the economy
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:10.560]   in southern china like when you go through shinjang and all those states that it's
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:15.520]   it's non trivial for the chinese government to manage that relationship as well right it's not
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:20.000]   a one-sided relationship i think that that's something that's easy to lose sight of is china
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.360]   benefits greatly from having all of apple's business there but apple also benefits greatly and has
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.000]   so much of its business there that it kind of can't get out and there aren't really any alternatives
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.320]   and so there is a push and pull and and this seems to be one of the places where this story
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:41.920]   notwithstanding it seems like apple has done a better job of identifying abuses and trying to
[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:48.240]   change the culture in these places to the best of its ability but how much is that really that's
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:54.720]   you know this is u.s. policy in general which is you want to promote uh democracy liberalism
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:00.800]   and freedom but at the same time you have to live in the world and not everybody believes the same
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.280]   way you do and you you know there are plenty of people in the united states i think we should just
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:10.800]   put up walls and and you know leave the rest of the world out um chappels point of view is we think
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:15.920]   we bring up the and i think a lot of people in the in the west believe this as well we improve
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:21.680]   situation the conditions wherever we are by participating as opposed to apple believe in engagement
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:25.600]   engage you know google didn't google said we're not going to deal with china we don't want to deal
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:31.600]   with it uh we're not going to sell to china um i think both of those are uh reasonable
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:34.960]   and they're very different circumstances like apple has not only huge manufacturing capabilities
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:39.760]   but a huge market is our second biggest market where google faces entrenched staunch competitors
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:44.480]   and why do you and wade all other companies where it's like amazon too it's nowhere nearly as
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:50.240]   attractive for them to be in those markets yeah it's easier for google say no yeah let's take a break
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.680]   great panel rene richies here slumming from mac break weekly good to see you we missed you on
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:00.560]   tuesday you'll be back this tuesday though right yes absolutely okay so we'll talk more about what
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:05.200]   you know someone's got to keep and you're not going to check oh man i don't know i think you i think
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.640]   you actually egg him on with the comic book stuff i think i blame you that's true you have jason
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:16.480]   on again then we'll just never stop it's also great to have jason stell another comic book fan
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:22.160]   apparently from six colors six colors dot com the incomparable you do those great radio plays and
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:25.760]   you still doing those right yeah the radio theater continues and we got lots of other
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.560]   podcasts over at the incomparable and uh you know there's the most important podcast on the network
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:35.760]   though perhaps is magnum podcast a podcast where uh phil michaels and i and david j lor
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:40.640]   uh watch magnum p_i from the eighties so you know it's a fine three it's a fine bit of
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:47.360]   madness with nineteen legacy from a friend oh yes what are you using lego to do the plot that's our
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:53.760]   that's our capatory david that's david all david he's lost david plays with the toys he where can i
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:59.360]   get this fabulous magnum p_i lego there's an etsy shop that makes things that are not named
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:07.760]   um the the brand name i believe it was 1980s tv detective it was uh or tv p i or something there's
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:11.920]   like a columba one and there's a magnum one and they find all the parts and and then you can buy them
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:20.800]   on the same one one thing and i and uh by the way you you say in this particular episode episode 37
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:27.120]   the uh legacy from a friend features a remarkably large number of things that make no sense oh yeah
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.880]   this we we all grew up with magnum p_i and we love it dearly but some of those episodes well magnum p_i was
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.920]   was made in the day when there were no dvrs and people weren't going to go back and watch things
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:43.920]   over and over again so it was a reddit at this time yeah there's no continuity editor saying that
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:51.040]   this doesn't make sense legend of the law star that you know i never really watched magnum p_i but
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:56.720]   now i think thanks to the good offices of the magnum podcast i might be able to change your life
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:01.200]   or it could change my life that that the uh the fact is that this is actually the 40th anniversary of
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:06.800]   raiders of lost ark and the story is that tom selick was cast as indiana jones and then they picked up
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:12.800]   magnum p_i to series and wouldn't let him out of that to shoot raiders of the lost ark and so
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:18.080]   uh eight years into their run they did like uh raiders of the lost ark parody episode just to i guess
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:23.920]   rub it in rub it in his face or maybe he felt less bad about it but remington steelham do you think
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:28.720]   his career would have had a different trajectory had he appeared in raiders of the lost ark you would
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:33.920]   say we think of the lost ark had a different trajectory we have this debate because um because
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:41.840]   tom selick is well a handsome man is very good at being a comic uh actor who reacts to stuff and uh
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:47.040]   that would have been very he would have been a very different indiana jones than harrison ford
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:51.680]   yeah and he did okay right he ended up on an eight-year run on network tv with magnum p_i and made a lot
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:57.040]   of money although he's doing those ads for a first more conversion sure so i don't mean what we do
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:01.920]   he knows in future episode i'm not the special episode where we review the reverse mortgage
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:09.680]   commercials i once interviewed the skipper from gilligan's island um um allen hale jr whose father
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:16.400]   was a great allen hale cowboy actor and uh it was very sad because uh he got paid so little for gilligan's
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:20.480]   island like you know hundred dollars an episode or something as long before you got to participate
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:25.600]   in the profits or anything that he really was broke uh later in life and was selling castrol oil
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:31.680]   on tv and uh i interviewed him and it was kind of a sad story because you know he was like for me
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:35.600]   i grew up with gill you grew up with magnum i grew up with gilligan's island and it was kind of sad
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:40.880]   to see uh the skipper struggling a little bit having gone through some tough times and thirst and

[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:57.040]   little as ten thousand dollars that's how much to get started you don't have to put in millions
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:02.240]   to do this this is actually a great way for you to kind of become part of something that's very
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:07.680]   very exciting or you can get into one of our crowd's funds they do funds too for as little as $50,000
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:12.480]   this would be I wouldn't say this is your only investment this is a way to diversify that's why
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.720]   they're looking for and accredited investors because I want to make sure you understand
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:21.680]   you know what you're getting into minimum of ten thousand dollars required to invest investment
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:27.520]   terms are going to vary depending on what country you're in and of course all of this is explained
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:31.040]   when you go to the site just put the country you're you're investing from in there and they'll tell
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.760]   you exactly what the requirements are I think this is really interesting so let me give you an example
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:42.640]   uh right now of uh of an investment they're getting into it's called moodify you can join
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:47.680]   right now our crowd's investment in moodify it's radically altering the multi-billion dollar fragrance
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:53.760]   market how are they doing that digitizing sense that this is the first company I've done this they
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:04:00.000]   develop software that enables function specific sense so things like improve mental performance
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.960]   this one I'm going to get eliminate the perception of bad odors and much more before people come back
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:12.000]   to the studio I got to get that you can get an early on moodify and other opportunities there are
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.520]   many more at our crowd.com/twit and if you're interested investing you have to join first
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.280]   you have to be accredited there is a minimum investment I want you to know that all up
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:29.200]   upfront but the our credit account is free oh you are crod.com/twit and I want you to know about
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:36.000]   this I think it's a very interesting opportunity uh I don't know I don't I've sat by on the wayside
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:41.280]   while so many people I know have become very very wealthy investing in companies that I'm looking
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:45.360]   at going I know this is going to be huge I'd think of you know people like Kevin Rose who got in
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:51.680]   at Twitter on Twitter in like 2007 at the very beginning this is an opportunity to do that
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:55.600]   so if you're in a position financially where this makes sense for you I think you really should
[02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:01.280]   check it out our crowd.com/twit not for everybody I understand that but for people who want to
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.320]   diversify their portfolios and have the money to do so this is a very interesting opportunity
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:10.880]   our crowd.com/twit thank you for supporting us by visiting that site
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:22.240]   iPhone 13 what how do you know about the iPhone 13 I you know I I only know what I read and there's
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:27.440]   always people I read on Tom's guide yeah no there no there's coming this fall we know that we know
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:34.560]   it's coming this fall one after 12 yep it actually might be the iPhone 12s no you never know would they
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:40.080]   skip the number 13 like you know that is that is a scary like certain Chinese phone makers skip
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:46.240]   the number four four four is unlucky eight's lucky that's where like nobody does nines no he's nine
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:50.480]   unlucky in China is that why no I don't know but there was no windows nine and there was no
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:56.240]   iPhone nine and there's no note nine they skip the nine right there was no iPhone nine yeah so
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:06:00.080]   that because mine means no in German let's let's assume that it's going to be called the iPhone 13
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:09.120]   oh is it because it means no in German or because that's the kids joke 9 9 13 that's
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:15.680]   you know unless you're a Trisca Decafobe that's a safe bet exactly yeah and we know or at least
[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:20.400]   where we can pretty much guess it's going to have a new processor it'll be the A15 processor
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:29.360]   and and the other stuff unlike software which apple keeps very much behind closed doors they
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:35.360]   have to work with supply chains and supply chains are a bunch of chatty cathees so you it's really
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:40.480]   true apple is very good at keeping the lid on Cupertino employees yeah but they can't stop
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:49.200]   Foxconn and the Foxconn suppliers from from talking so the rumors as we've been following
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:55.200]   them at Tom's guide is that the pro models will get the adaptive refreshing display much like that
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:07:02.160]   that's nice much like the gal promotion promotion promotion promotion and it could be possible
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:08.480]   that the lidar sensors will work their way down to the the standard and mini models apple wants to
[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:12.960]   do that because this is part of their AR straight exactly exactly got it now on the ipads they're
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:16.640]   going to have it on more phones that makes so you can you can make some educated guesses about
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:22.320]   what's going on from from what I really want to know is where's my pixel six that one's coming in
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:26.880]   October you think October that's what they usually announced that's they they're they're very
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:33.280]   predictable yeah although they didn't do a 5a they will be they have said that there was a rumor
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:40.320]   earlier that it was going to be canceled um uh and google did the rare step of actually confirming
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:45.520]   no no it hasn't been canceled it's coming to the u.s. in japan and it and the the official statement
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:53.040]   I believe was around the same time that the 4a was launched so that was August of last year meanwhile
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:59.520]   Larry Page is making robot air taxis I don't know when those are like
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:06.880]   forever so not allowed to touch page rank anymore the company's kitty hawk we've known about that
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:13.280]   for some time uh and this is the kitty hawk heavy side named after for some reason late english
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:17.920]   mathematician and physicist Oliver heavy side not named after the heavy side layer in the movie
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:23.200]   cats based on the street uh stage play cats could be maybe that's named after Oliver
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:29.040]   just by tsl I'm sure was he poem yes the heavy side that's what I thought it seems like heavy
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:36.480]   side's a bad name for something that flies but um I could be wrong um so they think they will have
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:44.240]   approval for electric air taxis uh in 2023 if you've been waiting for flying cars it's coming
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:52.720]   any day now um I guess there's not a lot more to say about that I my first ces um
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:09:01.360]   included a press conference for the flying self-driven car that was in 1995 yeah no no this was uh
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:08.640]   this was at like 2015 2016 and I remember the lead that I wrote uh was along the lines of
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:13.200]   you've been asking yourself where the hell are the flying cars here the hell are the flying cars
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:17.520]   yeah but the answer is where the hell are the floor they're always 10 years out every year they're
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:22.000]   10 years out that's the truth barely drive land cars this is not gonna go well for us yeah then
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:27.600]   the new york times today did a feature story that is basically all of the flying car startups
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:33.520]   that are out there all of which have these things that are basically like small airplanes with
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:39.200]   many many many propellers but the goal of all of these startups is to create something that's not
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:44.000]   affordable but actually extremely expensive but they can land sort of anywhere there there are
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.320]   VTOLs there are virtual vertical takeoff and landing passenger drones yeah yeah well you
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:54.400]   passenger drones right exactly you won't have a pilot instead it'll theoretically fly itself
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:58.080]   although some of the moral trilite aircraft and currently you have a you have a pilot but they're
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:04.800]   trying to really they're trying to make uh a drone that's big enough to carry a person instead of
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:09.440]   just like a little hg camera that's that's kind of what they're that so that uh determinators will
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:13.520]   have something to write in after a judgment day i recommend technology just in time i recommend
[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:17.200]   this new york times story because you can't read to the end of it without thinking this is never
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:22.800]   gonna work well here's a story from Forbes that well might even underscore that apparently the
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:29.280]   engineering for heavy side was done by a guy named daman van der Linde he conceived and built the
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:37.200]   initial versions but was fired in may uh by thrun Sebastian thrun who's the CEO of kitty hawk and
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:42.960]   that larry page former founder of google and you know money man behind kitty hawk because they
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.080]   disagreed uh sources according to Forbes said van der Linde thought the risk strategy that
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:54.560]   thrun and page were pursuing was too risky um so who did they hire to replace him the former editor
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:11:00.000]   of wired magazine yeah christian understanders understanderson who probably is a great engineer
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:07.440]   i don't know maybe not he he was a co-founder of 3d robotics which remembered tried to make a
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.880]   drone to compete with the dji and that's actually how you make a flying car as you stick on a thousand
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:20.800]   true fans yes that's it that is a very good joke i got it i like it just for you
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:29.200]   uh anyway uh flying cars i mean really place your bets i gotta do a sick regular segment
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:32.800]   you win some money if they ever make a flying car i gotta do regular segment on this show the
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:38.640]   annals of billionaires because they're up to all sorts of stuff like jeff bezos going in space
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:43.280]   and then richard branson richard branson after jeff bezos announces he's gonna go in space says
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:49.760]   no i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it before you do and now elon's on a rocket tesla tomorrow and i
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:57.600]   would be surprised wouldn't be surprised it's a very moon raker time was uh it is with uh if you
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:03.040]   if you real music energy you need not you need a giant mountain or maybe a secret island or
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:07.840]   something you know landing pad of money to follow gently i have to read i didn't i missed this i
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:14.080]   got the sunday times but i i missed this here's here's the flying car taking you don't want to ride that
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.480]   that one of their one other shots is of of one of these cars coming in for a landing it's the
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:25.120]   heavy side and it is the most tenuous oh god questionable landing ever and i'm sitting there thinking
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:31.280]   who released this is pr video what it does that's the one this is it here it is the press conference
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:37.200]   i went to see vertical takeoff and landing the CEO of this company said oh i was first inspired to
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:42.640]   build the flying car because a dear friend of mine died in a helicopter accident oh that's good and
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.840]   i'm thinking do you want other people to join me why don't why can't we just use the undisclosed
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:52.080]   ufo technology isn't it all just laying there ready for us to oh and by the way we're going to
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:58.160]   see the 25th we're going to see that report uh to congress about ufo's although it was leaked and
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:02.320]   apparently uh it's all just uh well we know everything's in there we know everything's in there we have
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:06.960]   the technology swap tips travel between planets but not to remain cloaked that's we know that's we know
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:10.640]   you know everything we need to know yeah they got everything they want except that this does not
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.960]   look like something i want to write in no the the part where it slams into the crown at the end
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:21.440]   the low point of it's got one two three four five six seven eight downward facing rotors so it is
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:26.080]   basically an upside down this is the video that they used so imagine what the other is a good one
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.040]   this is a good version of the good landing this took us 20 takes to get this right if you want
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:34.960]   to be convinced that flying cars are never going to have to read this article watch the videos and
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:40.480]   landing you can take off from i mean get a walk away from is a good one right the flight is nice
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:46.400]   but the landing is 9.2 g's and of course they're all expensive that's the other hundreds of thousands
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:51.280]   of dollars yes so it's not although they do the usual uh silicon valley softistry where they say
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:55.680]   things like oh but once they are driving themselves we'll make a pool of them and then they'll be
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:59.600]   available like a noob or on demand and then when you calculate all of that it will be much more
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:05.200]   expensive than flying or than driving it's like no that's not going to happen that's my neighbor
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:08.800]   has a seaplane just parked in the back on the river there and he takes off and lands all the
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:14.320]   times was this really that revolutionary the technology honest or are there angry um flying
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:18.080]   car people like there are angry tesla people and angry bitcoin people are we just gonna are we on
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:24.080]   their list now oh yeah yeah all right on every list of this one looks really kind of tesla flying
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:29.040]   cars with bitcoin which is going to be out here with this is uh from a company called opener again
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:34.720]   not a great name and it's the black fly the black fly because it probably buzzes and is a pet
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:38.960]   and it's easily swatted out of the sky
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:46.240]   i just yeah it's going to take longer than people think we need transportation for the
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:51.200]   Boston dynamic robots it's all this is about i swear to god this looks like this looks like
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:56.400]   the onion here's a guidance navigation and control engineer at opener in a custom flight
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:02.800]   simulator chair sure that that looks good there is a moment in this story where he's talking that
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:06.880]   the reporter is talking to one of these people at one of these companies and they're extolling the
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:11.920]   virtues of how quiet the thing is and then they have to stop talking because it's taking off and
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:17.360]   it's way too loud and you can see from that that the reporter is deeply skeptical of this whole
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:24.480]   quiet is all relative fockiness uh yeah well anyway that's good i will i will be reading that
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:30.160]   article this is uh this is an example of why the new earth times is actually better online because
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:36.400]   you can't do these animated gifts than the uh newspaper or whatever no animated uh newspapers
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:44.000]   and no flying cars this future the Jetsons got it wrong i got a robot vacuum though so i got that
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.320]   going for me facebook's going to do a smartwatch with two cameras
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:57.440]   to the last i have something to pair with my facebook phone i did i did work as a
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:05.040]   tweet just how about na na that's enough it's it doesn't even deserve an extra syllable just na
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:11.760]   you guys think about twitter's monetization plans you've got twitter blue which is not
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:16.320]   watching you did you you can get it in Canada right did you get twitter blue yeah yeah i looked at
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:20.480]   you know i mean but like i don't see any value prop it's like any feature that i wouldn't care
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:23.760]   about about twitter is available in twitter blue and no feature that i actually care about in twitter
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:30.720]   is available in twitter blue it's very odd and would you consider the uh the uh the only fans twitter
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:35.680]   only fans whatever it's called where you they pay it's more like patreon uh it's interesting and
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:39.680]   they've they've confounded it with a newsletter service sort of just bake that right in there and
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:44.720]   it's it's interesting because we're watching instagram um sort of try to find its way by doing
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:50.160]   affiliate revenue for creators and niktok and snap have creator funds youtube just does
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:54.880]   direct payments through ad sense and now they're adding applause and they have memberships and
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:59.600]   they're all trying to figure out ways to sort of share the money but not really share the money
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:04.320]   and i feel like it's not democratic enough because people are giving them vast amounts of data and
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:09.120]   unless you're you know creator you're not getting anything back from those platforms so it's like
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:14.960]   half a step diagonally in one direction that might be slightly forward happy anniversary to the uh
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:25.120]   ad86 42 years ago Intel's uh uh 16-bit architecture that actually created the x86 architecture we're
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:30.240]   still using the designers at the time extreme tech had a great article on the 42nd anniversary
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:36.960]   the designers at the time thought this is just a temporary chip just a temporary the
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:42.640]   according to steven p morse who led the development of the ad86 the new cpu was quote intended to be
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:49.760]   short-lived and not have any successors 42 years later we can't get away from x86
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:56.240]   so what made that architecture succeed was that it was in p b m p c's or things like that at the
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:01.200]   time and that's and then everybody wanted all their software with it standardized on that and
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.280]   then couldn't escape the gravity that's what the gravity started for microsoft yeah right then
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:11.200]   yeah no defying gravity um they did make decisions that made it easy to maintain backwards
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:18.000]   compatibility with earlier intel products so even the x86 was wearing the millstone of legacy
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:24.240]   he uh the designer morse notes that had he known he was inventing an architecture that would power
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:29.600]   computing for the next 40 years he would have done some things differently including using a
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:35.840]   symmetric register structure and avoiding something that still gets me something called segmented
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:43.440]   addressing which is clearly a cluge uh when i first i had been programming for the mac for the
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:48.480]   sixty eight thousand which had a flat memory architecture it was beautiful it had uh uniform
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:53.120]   registers it had all the things the x86 didn't when i started reading the documentation from the x86
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:19:01.120]   i said what you can't address all the memory at once you can always uh amazing it was your beta max
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:08.640]   yeah but at one the beta the sixty eight thousand was the beta max sad to say the x86 was the vhs
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:16.400]   uh and then finally well actually two more stories one very interesting i'll be watching
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:22.320]   with interest el Salvador has adopted bitcoin as its legal tender it was using the u.s dollar but
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:29.920]   it wanted something less stable i guess yeah so so uh yeah you can now pay your taxes in el Salvador
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:39.440]   and bitcoin you can buy stuff in bitcoin exchange that saves you money on wheelbarrows uh it's
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:48.240]   it's crazy um i don't yeah it's just so volatile it seems like it might be a bad choice for a national
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:53.600]   currency but the part of the problem is about 70 percent of the el Salvador population doesn't
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:58.720]   have access to banks or any other traditional financial services so this way they can they can
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:05.520]   create an imp you know jump skip the bank thing and go straight to the crypto thing skip the copper
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:14.480]   um bitcoin is is kind of it was up 230 percent over the last 12 months so it's very volatile but
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:18.800]   now now it's back down a little bit it's just crazy and finally i will still end with this because
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:26.400]   this is our comedy segment uh representative louis gomer of texas uh i don't know do you have
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:32.640]   people like this in the uh in the uh can canadian parliament sadly yeah they're all from elbert
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:41.360]   oh seeing sorry elbert uh and kabek kabek is easy is this an inside joke i don't know no it's
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:47.840]   albert is is the texas of can the texas of canada well louis gomer's from the texas of texas and uh he
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:53.040]   asked whether the forest service well i'll let you i'll let him he's talking to the uh forest service
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:58.320]   or the uh it's not blm black lives matter the bureau of land management he's concerned about
[02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:06.080]   global warming um and so is there anything that the national forest service or blm can do to
[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:13.120]   uh change the course of the moon's orbit or the earth's orbit around the sun
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:19.840]   obviously that would have profound effect profound our climate yeah well he's thought it through yeah
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:23.040]   i would have to follow up with you on that one mr gomer
[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:29.760]   you can't well if you figure out a way that you in the uh forest service can make that change
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:35.760]   like to know uh also yeah the forest service has uh all the tools it needs to change the earth's
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:42.000]   orbit all the trees trees are very tall you take some of those sequoias in the national parks and you
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:46.880]   what if we put a comb around the line cars in the same space and just engage their engines all at
[02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:51.280]   once actually i had a he'd have more credibility if he said could we have superman fly around the
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:57.520]   world backwards and reverse time would that be possible i believe that mr freeze just shoot
[02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:04.720]   shoot the earth for the tenure anyway i just uh that's on twitter see there's the tech angle it's on
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:11.280]   twitter uh awesome tech that would have to be used to closely technology would have to use to of
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:16.240]   course it would but you can't just move the moon that tree idea i was floating now it's just me
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:23.520]   rain star yeah hey it's been great having you philip i had no idea you had all this connection
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:30.240]   to all these guys so it's wonderful to have you uh in i it's it is good to uh to be in and to see
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:33.440]   come back that i haven't seen in a while and i'd love to come back that's kind of what this
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:38.080]   show's all about is folks you haven't seen in a while and for the first time in studio which is
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:44.240]   really great managing editor at uh tom's guide which has always been a very good a place to get
[02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:49.040]   your tech news and information and sure kilups keeping up the good work thanks anything you want to
[02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:54.640]   plug besides your tom's sonic podcast which i think we've really really done uh no i we've
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:59.680]   we've done the lord's work there uh that and tom's guide those are those are what's uh a lot of my
[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:06.240]   hours you you don't have like a odd couple podcasts no not not yet not yet okay what would be the
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:13.040]   next tv show you might want to but i think it would be tales from tales of the gold mongue
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:18.880]   sure a podcast where people tell stories about the ill-fated abc adventure series
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:24.080]   tales of the gold monkey ill-fated how many seasons did it just one season one but it was uh it was
[02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:29.920]   a memorable one so you it's not like you already got this all teed up i'm really glad to hear it
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:35.200]   because you know the nonsense level of our podcasting is continues to increase after all these years

[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:03.920]   and get them back on the air and rene richie someday you'll come down you'll be allowed to cross the
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:10.080]   forty ninth parallel and enter open the border again the golden land of opportunity uh stuck up
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:16.880]   there in montreal youtube.com/rene richie is is youtube feed anything what are you what are you up to
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:23.440]   these days i saw you had a good reaction video on ios 15 anything i had like a really really hard
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:28.240]   week beyond wwdc and maybe reevaluate a lot of stuff so i decided the last two videos were very
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:33.120]   different than usual i was very based and i think i'm going to continue that like less packaged more
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:39.040]   um more direct communication so now i'm changing up the style of the videos i was starting which one
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:46.480]   should i watch just is the prototype why you hate ipad o s 15 i had pro rage that was a good one
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:50.880]   i'm gonna watch that thank you okay like little things like you know not disclosing that the guy
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:54.800]   you have talking badly about apple silicon is paid by you know consulting by intel those
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:59.200]   sort of things i think you just mentioned those in passing oh you know your coverage oh you think
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:04.960]   you would who did that yeah uh wired in their story about you know why apple didn't bring some
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:11.520]   of the m1 features to intel um they have an analyst who has been incredibly pro intel you know as
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:15.680]   since he's been consulting for intel over the last year and they don't mention actually interesting
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:23.120]   story uh right now rumor that intel is looking at buying for two billion dollars a chip maker s i
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:32.480]   five sci-fi and their claim to fame is much like arm they design not build their their fabless
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:40.720]   chip designer on all around uh risk architectures so this may be intel's we'll see this may be intel's
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:47.920]   response to the m1 they might be might be looking more at risk five yeah uh s sci-fi i don't know if
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:54.880]   it's sci-fi or si-fi i think it's sci-fi um is led by a guy who was at quackalcom until last year
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:26:01.600]   and it's i think i guess it's it's it's they're they want to they want to compete with arm of course
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:05.760]   arm is about googles working on their own silicon too yeah it's gonna be super interesting yeah that's
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:09.840]   one one of the reasons i was interested in pixel six is because that's a google system on a chip yeah
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:16.960]   so uh yeah i i think it's you know 42 years old the x86 architecture maybe time to look at something
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:24.160]   else thank you for being here and a lc on tuesday thank you all for joining us we do this week in
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:28.320]   tech every week believe it or not it's hard to believe something this wonderful could be on
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:35.120]   weekly but it it really really is uh joy i'm just kidding join us uh every sunday right after the
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:42.880]   radio show 230 pacific 530 eastern 2130 UTC there's a live stream you can watch live audio and video
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:50.480]   so watch or listen at twit.tv/live if you're doing that the chatroom is live at irc.twit.tv there's
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:56.560]   also a kind of another room going on in our discord which i really enjoy rene i saw you were in there
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:02.480]   if you are a member of club twit you can which is something we just launched recently and it's

[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:13.040]   ad-free versions of all of our shows ad-free and as a result tracker free but you also get access
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:16.160]   to the discord which was we thought we're just going to throw this in and it turns out to be
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:21.680]   really wonderful place to hang out um we've been having a lot of fun in there uh we do a
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:26.080]   linux show on saturday's there's stuff we can do thanks to club twit that we really couldn't do
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:32.000]   before we also have a twit plus feed of stuff that didn't make it into the podcasts
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:37.680]   additional stuff we're actually going to try on a new show in there uh for breaking tech news so
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:43.200]   that'll be something to watch for and uh there's also so this the ad free versions the discord and
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:47.600]   club twit twit plus feed all of that for seven bucks a month i wanted to give it a plug because
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:52.240]   we'd love to have you in the club it shows your support for twit helps us keep doing what we want
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:57.600]   to do and provided enough people show interest we could do even more we're you know looking at
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:03.520]   going back to ces and things like that uh more information at twit.tv/clubtwit
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:08.960]   on demand shows always still available for free there's no paywall at twit.tv you can get this
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:13.760]   show and every one of the shows we do and have ever done they're all available for download there

[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:44.560]   we also have our twit forums for people who are watching after the fact it's a little less
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:50.880]   live than the chat and the discord but it's really a great place for conversation twit.com community
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:59.040]   www.twit.com community we also run mastodon which is a fediverse federated version of twitter
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:05.680]   at twit.social and i'd love to see you all in both those places as well and all that's free
