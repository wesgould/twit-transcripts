[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   The Big Bang.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   It's time to Twit and a very good day to all of you.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Here we are gathered together to once again dissect,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   analyze and misrepresent the world of technology news.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I'm your chief misrepresenter Leo LaPorte,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   joining us on the panel today.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   The wonderful Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Hello Andy.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Hey there, hi there, and ho there.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Are you in the Dunscap Studios?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Dunscap Studio A, the Aerosmith got out of Studio B,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   so we've got the whole facility to ourselves,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   so no band width restrictions here we go.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It doesn't leave like little wet marks everywhere he goes,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I just don't like him.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   We just replace the carpets every time he pays them,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   he pays them off.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Hey, we can afford it.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I feel bad because last week poor Andy's
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   sitting in Dunscap Studios for like an hour.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Wait for--
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I actually created the lists, so they're going to put
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Skype on the list.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   You're on my list, buddy!
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Because I assume that if you log into Skype at computer B,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Skype just assumes that you would want to log all the chat
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   invites to, you know, about new computer,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   but apparently not.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Yeah, because I called and no Andy, so we just--
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yeah, we went on.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Andy might be coming back to this.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I sense he's going to come back to this computer
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   that he hasn't touched in the half hour,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   so I'll just keep all the chat invites to this first machine.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   That's a good idea to do.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I would have liked to have you on the show because it was a show
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   that needed the Inotco Touch, but don't worry because this show
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   will also need that touch.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Joining us from Great Britain to give it the British Touch,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   just a little touch of class, of course,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   will Harris from willharris.co.uk with 1L,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   has 2Ls of the superfluous.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Well, we'll have that.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Good to have you back, and we're going to get a report on Halo 3
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   because you've just spent the entire weekend playing it.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And because John C. Devora couldn't join us,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   he's traveling this weekend,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   playing the role of the curmudgeon, Mr. Reynolds.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Not a pirate.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Big chainy, all right.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Welcome, Mr. Vice President.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   What an honor.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   All right, hi, Leo. Good to be on.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Thank you.

[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I just watched -- I'm catching up on my sopranos,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and I just watched the episode where Uncle Jr.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   writes to Dick Cheney, saying,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   "You know what it's like having trouble with a gun accidentally
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   shooting somebody.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You know, help me out here."
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I hope that's not my position this time.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   No, Randall Schwartz is -- oh, I don't even know where to begin.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He does the Geek Cruises News' podcast
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   because he has been on every single Geek Cruise ever.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   All 37 of them, so far.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   All 37 of them.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And he's, of course, a world-famous Pearl programmer,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   the author of Learning Pearl -- what, not Learning Pearl?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yes, Learning Pearl.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Learning Pearl Intermediate Pearl,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   which used to be called Learning Pearl Object Professors of Modules.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I was the author of the original programming Pearl, blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Pearl's, of course, swine.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yes, 250 magazine articles, too.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   All right.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Well, he's always writing one.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And a regular around the Twit headquarters.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It's good to have you back, Randall.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And possibly we're going to -- we're waiting to see if Doc Serals will chime in
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   because the big story of the week is Microsoft.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Steve Ballmer -- I mean, talk about Dick Cheney.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Steve Ballmer is a Dick Cheney of Microsoft.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   He's the hit man.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   The guy you bring in there to deliver the bad news steps forward this week to say,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   "Linux and open source software violated 235 Microsoft patents,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   and declines to say whether they're going to sue,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   declines even to say which patents."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   What the hell is going on?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Doc is a virulent anti-software patent guy,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   so if we can get him on to talk about it, we will.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   But Randall, you must have an opinion on this.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You work in open source of free software all the time.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Linus Torvald said -- see, part of the problem is Microsoft is saying
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   you guys should look and see what patents you violate and let us know and pay us.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And Linus says, "I'm not going to look because even the act of looking could cause problems."
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   He said most open source programmers intentionally don't do patent searches.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Software patents are so vague, so difficult to enforce.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   We don't want to do software patent searches because that exposes us to liability.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   This is a problem with software patents.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's supposed to be something like copyrights where in order for a copyright to be violated,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I actually have to go to your software and pick it up and drop a piece of it
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   or derive work in my work.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   With patents, I can be completely isolated.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I can be working in Antarctica and come up with something really clever and cool,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   but you might already have a patent on it and that's where it goes bad.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And this is just insane.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   From what I can tell from seeing various opinions of this thing,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   this thing that Microsoft's doing is just saber rattling.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   They're just trying to scare up the notion that maybe some more people
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   ought to pay them the way that Dell did.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Yeah, well, and you mean novelded?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Novelded, sorry.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   That's where the story really begins because novella,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   nobody could understand this, gave Microsoft this huge amount of money as a license fee
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   to indemnify itself and its users, people using SUSA Linux,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   so that Microsoft wouldn't sue them.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And everybody said, "What?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Who would Microsoft sue them?"
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Well, now the other shoe drops.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Microsoft does think it's got, I think it's 235 patents total and 42 of them, 43 of them.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   No one knows in the Linux kernel alone.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   How many of them are going to be the obvious stuff?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   They're all going to be obvious.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I think there's been an analysis already that somebody, I forget now,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   sorry, I don't have the name in front of me,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   but somebody earlier said that there was about 220 Microsoft patents,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   this is a research from like a year ago, that would overlap things that are in common
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   place in open source.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So maybe Microsoft's actually using this list that was revealed a year ago.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's a similar number, isn't it?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yeah, it's way too similar, yes.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And then they added through and a few like, "Oh, mice clicking, we own that."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   The triple click, they patented the triple click.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   They may well have been, you know, that's a save dialogue, right?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   That's a very numbers out of your butt.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Also a Microsoft edition.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   No, there's got to be prior for that.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So, Brock Law had something to say about this.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Actually, I guess it was even Mowglen, who is the lawyer we've talked to him on Floss Weekly,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   who is a really brilliant guy who is behind GPL3.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   What's the story on these ASUS of vouchers?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Will, do you want to talk about this?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Yeah, well, it seemed like, obviously, the Nivel vouchers have been demitted,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   issued by Microsoft.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Isn't that sounds positively--
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It sounds like the letters of transit in California.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Or it sounds papal.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You know, we will sell you a voucher of liability.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It could be like a dulled warcraft certificate of indemnification.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Yeah, it could be a wow item.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's crazy.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It was basically saying that there's no expiration date for redemption of the voucher.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   So, what could technically happen is that when the GPL version 3 comes in,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   which has a clause in it, which basically really tears down the boundaries between
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   proprietary and open source software,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   when that comes in, if somebody then redeems a voucher after that,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   then that could be that then all this pacing claims are invalidated because someone
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   has redeemed the indemnification of that--
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Just redeem it once.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   All of the Linux community.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So, here's the clause in the GPL3 that Mowglen says triggers is,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   "If--" No, I'm going to speak legal easily here.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   "If pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   That is very important.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   A single transaction or arrangement.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   "You convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of a covered work
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   and grant a patent license providing freedom to use propagate modifier convey a specific copy of the covered work
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   to any of the parties receiving the covered work,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   then the patent license you grant--" and this is the important part,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   second important part--" is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   and works based on it."
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So, in other words, if Microsoft, even to one person says, "Okay, you're clear, everybody's clear."
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Which is pretty crazy.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   How much money is it going to cost me in court to basically have that endorsed?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   If I run into trouble, I mean, that's the force of this--
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And really judge even understand this.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I mean, Mowglen says, "Microsoft's been tossing the vouchers wholesale out of airplanes,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   quote, as though coupons themselves were hot, as indeed they are."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   He says, Mowglen says, "Even that won't work because of the lack of an expiration date on the vouchers."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   In other words, as the sun sets up with her eyes and this is Groglaw writing,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   "We may be bidding a fond farewell to Microsoft's patent bullying."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   They've actually pulled the rug out from under their bullying.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   So, it says that--
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Anybody got a voucher?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Randall, you should buy a voucher.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I don't have a voucher.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   No.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   There's an interesting thing in the computer world which says that Microsoft declined to comment on the issue through the operations firm on the grounds that GPLv3 is still in draft form.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   However, Mowglen thinks the company is being deliberately vague about complaints with GPL3.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Interesting.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   But GPL is not the only open source licenses out there.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   There was Microsoft talked about the BSD style licenses and the other things that are out there.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Nope.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Probably not.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   But let me understand.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Do you think that what Microsoft is doing now is because GPL3 is coming close to reality?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Microsoft's just a death pangs.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   This is them realizing that open source software is taking over.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I think that's-- if anything, the interpretation I would put on this is they're scared.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   You don't start spreading fun like this unless you're really threatened.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Of course, Rebelize.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   This is the company that even the US government couldn't break up.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Right.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Yeah, and also this has-- if this is really a tactical op, this has to be a two or three-year plan because as yet the open source community has yet to produce something that does for the average user what Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office does.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Right.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And I think it really just illustrates the fact that Microsoft is such a large company.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   You can have different factions just pulling in completely different directions.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   You know, the legal guys in this end trying to, you know, sue open source into a blivion.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And then you've got the guys like doing silver light making it cross-platform and, you know, striking out in all kinds of different ways.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And it just seems like, you know, there's no real direction that Microsoft has.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   It just goes in all these kind of different little spikes, you know?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It goes in all regions.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Well, yeah, that really is exactly what I thought since I saw this.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I didn't see some guy at the very, very top issue in a directive that then all departments have to then figure out how to implement.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I saw one section of Microsoft feeling as though they could make a play that tactically would work out well for them.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Yeah, but Steve Ballmer is a big section.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Yeah, but I don't know.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I keep wondering how much he's the head and how much he's the tail.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Now, we know how much he's the tail.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   If you've seen that video of him talking about 12% percent.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But he's the big old tail.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Big old tail.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So according to Engadget, a 66 year old inventor has thinks that he's actually patented Velcro.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And he says his slidingly engaging fastener actually isn't patented Velcro.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   He's going to replace Velcro.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   It's the next Velcro.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I apologize.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   It uses a series of interlocking grids consisting of tiny hexagonal or triangular islands, which apparently form an uncommonly strong bond when they're joined together.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   They can support eight times the weight of Velcro.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   This is like when the company tries to convince me to buy a new razor that has four blades instead of three, isn't it?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Are you still using four? I'm using five.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   I don't know how many remember Neralco, but I mean, I just, I'm too much going out of my life to be worried about what shaped my Velcro thing is our end.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I just love it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Engadget also.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Engadget got a lot of attention last week when it released what it claimed was an Apple memo, an internal email saying, and it's, boy, when I read it, and I read it before the retraction, it sounded like an April Fool's joke saying,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   the iPhone is going to be pushed back to October and Leopard is going to be pushed back to 2008.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Sorry.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And, and Engadget published this at 11.49 AM.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   The stock price, massive selling on Wall Street, it dropped in six minutes from 11.56 AM to 12.02.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It dropped from 179 bucks to 103 bucks, wiping out $4 million in market cap.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I had two reactions to this.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Number one, when you read about how this story came about, it's not as if they got an anonymous email and that was too good to go with.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   This was supposedly an app from Apple PR, so you can just simply go onto their website, call, make a phone call and try to verify this because it just seems so outrageous.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   On the other hand, no, I wasn't aware that Engadget had a, had a way of making $4 billion in money disappear.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   So I think we should all be very nice to Engadget.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Engadget number one news source.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Very.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Let's see what Engadget, please don't touch my 401k.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It's amazing, isn't it? The power that they wield.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Now the good, go ahead.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   That's just my say.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's also incredible how quickly the stock bounced back.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Well, that's exactly right.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   It rebounded by 12, 12, I'm sorry, 1222, it had rebounded and ended the day just down just 1.25 billion in market cap.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   I was actually up.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   It was up.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   In fact, up a lot because first Apple denies it, Engadget retracts it.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Stock market responds by rebounding most of the way.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   The next day, the FCC approves the iPhone and the actual Apple stock ends up finally up to $109 up to $2.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   The real winner here is the person who bought it 103 bucks.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Yeah, that's what I was wondering about.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Given that this phone press release was sent out by an individual, it seems as...
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It's a new kind of pump and dump.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Yeah, that's what I was wondering about.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   That's the first thing I thought about.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Well, I mean, it's crazy because you have to give some credit to Engadget because if it was a setup,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   it was a really good setup.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   I mean, the email came from inside Apple.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Yeah, but they should have.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   It was sent through the Apple mailing list to all Apple employees.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   It came from inside.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And then was forwarded by an Apple employee to Engadget.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I mean, you can see exactly why they would go for it.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And you can also see Apple PR is notorious for not giving a monkeys about replying to anybody.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Do you think they just didn't call New York Times?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Do you think they just didn't bother?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   No, so Engadget did put a call into numerous places like inside Apple to try and get a confirmation or rejection or whatever.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   But of course, Apple is notoriously difficult to talk to unless you are Walt Mossberg or whoever.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   They're just like, "We're not bothering with blogs."
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Now, here's what Engadget says.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   This email was sent within Apple's internal email system to its employees.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   He says, "That fact is not in question according to Engadget.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Do they have their return to that sense?"
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   No, no, no.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   That's absolutely true.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   What had happened was that someone, you know, the speculation about how it happened, either someone hacked in through, you know, their mail server and at least this phony news, you know, inside or more controversially.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   You could, the speculation that it could have been someone within Apple looking to flush out a leak.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Ah, no, that's happened.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   To see who forwarded it, you know, what's happened.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So the email...
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Well, okay, that's a good point.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I have received these sort of emails before some, I believe from Apple, some from other companies, and the solution is always the same.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   You basically, your reaction has to be met with the same degree of passion as the ridiculousness of the claim.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   The ridiculousness that the iPhone is going to slip that many months is so good that I would have to look for Apple's personal information.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I would have to look for other, I'd have to exploit other assets before I would report on it.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Even if I did at that point, my report, I mean, this is something that's really, really basic journalism.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   You would say not that Apple has announced this, but that we received a sort of odd PR thing from someone purporting to be from Apple.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   We are, the story is still active. We're still falling up on it.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   This is a rumor at this point until we get it directly from Apple.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   I'm wondering if this doesn't speak to the fact that there is so much clamoring by so many parallel news sources to try to get information.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   In the old days, we would have had one or two or three networks that would have sat on this for a bit, knowing that nobody else was going to break it right away in the general resources.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Engage it now, trying to compete with 17 other ways that I could find out about inside Apple.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   They got to get it out before Gizmodo does. They're Russia.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Exactly. Exactly.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   We end up with the irresponsible and unethical operation.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Well, I wouldn't go as far as a column irresponsible and unethical.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Their passion got ahead of them, and that's a big mistake.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   They said, "I'll quote this is Ryan Block, the posting 1149 May 16th, Ryan Block says, "We have it on authority."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   That's all he says that as of today, the iPhone launches being pushed back.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   We have it on authority.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Now, he doesn't say anything else.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I guess, I don't know, what would you do, Ani and Naco, if you get sent from a reliable source, what is clearly an internal Apple email?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   It's their bullet news.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I mean, what would you do?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Well, first of all, I'm in the very luxurious position.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   You don't have to get it out fast.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Well, exactly.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Let's say you're Ryan.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Let's say you're Ryan, and you're on the line.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Well, what I'm all about to say is that when there were rumors about leopard shipping in March or April and May,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   as soon as I got that information, I was weighing this against what I know about the status of leopard and what I know from conversations I've had from people inside of Apple and analysts outside of Apple.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And I know that this is one vote for leopard shipping in March or April, and 100 votes against it shipping even in the timeframe that Apple originally promised.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   If I received that email, I would be immediately suspicious because everything that I'm seeing says that the iPhone is on track to be announced to be released when Apple thinks it's going to be released.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   I would be dogging down so many contacts.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I would be calling in favors to confirm this first.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Also, if it were really a PR release that's been released by Apple, Apple released to me, they never have any problems confirming something that they've already made public.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I would think it's very, very suspicious that I couldn't find any other markers.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Then in the end, I would have probably would have done what appleinsider.com, which is a very, very good news site.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   They're not a rumor site.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   They're a very good news site.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   They often say, "Look, we have this thing that we don't know what to do with it.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   We think the responsible thing is to tell you that we've received this information, but also say that it looks suspicious and we haven't really confirmed it yet.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   But FYI, here's what we got, and here's the background on how we got it."
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   That is really true.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   That's the right thing to do.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I think you absolutely right.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   In other words, transparency.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Be completely transparent about it.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Tell them what's going on.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And don't attempt to get a leg up on the other guy.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Except then you might have accidentally revealed or might have to deliberately reveal your source tracking.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I mean, how is it they got this information?
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   They might have to start saying, "We got it because this guy that we've been dealing with all this time forwarded to us, that might be more telling than what they'd want to do."
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Yeah, and this is something that all journalism is facing.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I had a really interesting conversation with some guy who had put in 30 or 40 years in television journalism behind the scenes
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and talking about what it was like during the late '60s and early '70s when he first got on the scene
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   saying that it was great because we were shooting, there was no such thing as a live fee, so we didn't have to worry about going out live.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Also, even better than that, we shot everything on film, which took time to process, which took time to physically cut and edit,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   which gave the person whose filing this report time to talk to more people, time to sit and pause and relax and have a coffee or an Irish coffee.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And think about whether this makes sense in the best way to report it.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   But there's no use of being nostalgic about that. That's long gone.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Slow down the internet.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Well, nowadays, we have live feeds of a car on a highway doing nothing but driving down a highway.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   We're going to see until the public demands something better than this, this is the sort of mistakes that are going to be made.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And once again, in gadget's currency is immediacy.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And this is a mistake that is very, very easy to make when your lead time is dictated by minutes as opposed to hours or days.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   So again, I'm not demonizing them. I'm glad I'm not in that sort of situation.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   However, again, if the public is not willing to accept that sort of stuff, they're going to have to make more demands upon the media more than,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   "Hey, look, I just got this information for anybody else."
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Well, did any of the Apple rumor sites fall into this trap? It happened so fast. They didn't have time, probably.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I don't think so. I didn't tune into the rest of the... I wasn't starting to look at other rumor sites until two hours after the announcements came out.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   I'm sure, right. Speaking of, by the way, this is not the only big story that got botched.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And there's another big story that got botched by mainstream news, or maybe not. I don't know.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   There was a story... Actually, it wasn't exactly mainstream media, but there's a story going around.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And I saw it picked up on slash dot, but it was originally published on a Seattle website called CrossCut.com that covers Seattle news
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   that the post-intelligencer, the Seattle PI, was going to start putting itself out on electronic paper sometime in the next two years.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I reported the story. A lot of people did. I thought it was a very interesting story.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Then the Hearst Corporation and the PI said, "No, we're not... No, what are you talking about? We have no plans whatsoever to do that."
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Now, Hearst does, in fact, own a part of the company that's doing this. It's a Phillips.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   The electronic paper comes from Phillips.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And it's kind of credible that this might, in fact, be in plan. Maybe they didn't want anybody to know it.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Maybe they didn't want the unions to know it. It's very cool. This electronic paper, you can roll it up, put it in your pocket.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It would automatically have the latest news on it.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Does it clean itself? Have you put it in the bird cage?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I don't know. That's a good question.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   It smells like one of those tree-shaped air fresheners.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Yeah. It's $8. Can you $48? Not so much this roll-up.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I'm thinking it's a true story. It's got to cost a lot of money.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   But you reuse it. You don't have to buy a new paper.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Well, there's a lot of really great technology that hasn't really been out there yet.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   I have a friend who works for an outfit called Nadek Labs here in Massachusetts.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   And their job is to basically beta-test all technology that the military is thinking about using.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And they have... Better than digital paper, they have digital cloth that can be basically sewn into a uniform.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Wow.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   So, you're sleeve is a monitor and your sleeve is also a keyboard.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And the damn thing works. It's the most incredible thing.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Now, of course, you have to be the United States government on a spending,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   fortunately, we have a United States government on a spending.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   We do.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   To be able to afford the sort of stuff.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And it's also hard to realize that Sony has a really... I think a really, really nice e-book reader.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   But no one can really justify spending $299 for a digital book reader,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   even though it does support open formats.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   So, they have so many different problems to crack before digital paper becomes better than a half-cent sheet of paper.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   LG Phillips...
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   LG Phillips, the company that developed this Korean display manufacturer,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   said it solved a lot of the problems of e-ink.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   They've got a 14.1-inch color screen using e-ink.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   It's thinner than a postcard.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Has the clarity of a traditional newspaper.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   It's color.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Can be bent with no distortion or fade.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And they announced that a week ago.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So, you got to think that newspapers have to do something.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   You're in the newspaper business.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   The cost of newsprint and ink is skyrocketing.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Revenues are plummeting thanks to Craig's list and websites that are stealing the traditional revenue of newspapers.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   That's exactly the problem.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   A lot of the blogging and a lot of the conversation I hear is more about how the newspapers and magazines are being challenged by journalism.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   They're not.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   They love the journalism that's being done in blogging.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Oftentimes an editor in a newspaper or a magazine will poach a blogger because they're doing such great work.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   They'll write them checks in order to write for them.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   The problem is that they just don't have any advertising.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   They can't figure out a way to get people to pay for the product that consumers still want.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   All the news that still goes around is still links to the Seattle PI, Boston Post, Boston Globe, New York Times.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   It's just that the 50 cents is not being dropped into the political machine.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   They're not making the money.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   That's right.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Unfortunately, I really think it's a system that's going to have to collapse not completely but largely so that it can be rebuilt in a brand new and modern fashion.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   You don't see the newspapers being the ones to do this.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   It is one of those things where you've heard me use this phrase before.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   It's a great e-paper electronic documents, electronic news.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   It's a great idea.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   A lot of people are going to have to die first before it really becomes reality.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Meaning we're not going to go out and kill people to make this happen.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   But a whole generation of businesses are going to have to collapse and have to be reborn with people who are running these companies who grew up reading their news online.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   People who grew up consuming their news online before they figure out how to make not only just make this work but also make money at it.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   That's the toughest not to crack, how to make money at it.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   It was a little deja vu because I'm reading slash dot and I read the first story.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I had even mentioned it on the air.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   And then eight hours later slash dot update, nope, retraction.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   It's not going to happen.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   So I'm thinking, boy, this is the week of retractions.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Bad news.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   I don't have to think about publishing online.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   You can always burn the evidence really quickly.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   I keep thinking this has got to be a phony story, but I haven't heard any retractions yet.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I saw it on TechCrunch and I've now seen it repeated on a number of other sites.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   CBS apparently has purchased the financial podcast Wall strip for $5 million.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   That's awesome, isn't it?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I find it hard to believe, frankly.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   It's not like it.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I mean, it's a really good podcast.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Can we start a financial podcast?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   The first thing I did was say, wait, quick, who could?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   So I think what they're really interested in is not so much the podcast or the content,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   but the host of the podcast is absolutely adorable.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Apparently, according to TechCrunch, Wall strip had her contract locked down and they were
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   trying to get Lindsey Campbell, the host of it.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And since they had the contract locked down, they paid $5 million, bought the podcast,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   and now they've got Lindsey.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   So between, they've got her and they have got Amanda Congdon.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Sounds like CBS is interested in, I don't know what, Cute Girl Podcasts something network.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   The Cute Girl Podcasts network.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   It's got to look into the shareholders.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   $5 million.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Yeah, but you're buying a lot of talent.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   I guess it's talent.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   It's a classic go far beyond that, especially depending on what the terms of that contract are.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Yeah, Katie Couric gets $15 million.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   That's true.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   And what's she doing lately?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Well, more people listen to her than to me, so I suppose I shouldn't say anything.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I just, I had to say, wow, yeah, let's start a financial podcast quick.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Yeah, and realize we are in what our third, third boom right now.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Is this the third boom?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   What boom is this?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Boom 3.0?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   This would be the one that's going to collapse in 11 months where it's amazing when you see
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.360]   all these, I'm getting more in, I can always tell what stage the boom we're in by the number
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.920]   of invitations I get to go to New York and have lunch with a CEO.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.920]   Because everybody has a brand new CEO and they want me to meet them.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   That hasn't happened since the late 90s.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.920]   Now, it hasn't gotten so bad that I have to tell them, well, no, it's not actually ethical
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   for you to fly me out and give me dinner.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.920]   So I could, you know, not that I'm interested in your bowling alley maintenance, social networking
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.920]   book, book marking with user generated content portal.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.320]   But yeah, I mean, I have no doubts that there are people who are willing to chase that kind
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   of money.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   Do you remember how much money was paid for the business.com domain back in the...
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   No, how much?
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   The second boom.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   It wasn't something like one.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.800]   It was in the seven figures.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   I remember that.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   Shh, millions of dollars.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.280]   Someone had the business.com domain and someone had in the pockets checkbook.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   And where is business.com?
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.280]   Is it online?
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   I mean, we don't...
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   Probably at least to a porn site.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.280]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.320]   Well, there are acquisition rumors flying around the rumor, according to ValleyWag, that
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.520]   Google's about to buy feed burner for $100 million.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.160]   Worth while, you think?
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.080]   It's quite a lot of money.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.680]   I'm not sure exactly why they would, to be honest with you.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   But who knows?
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.320]   I mean, why did Google pay $6.1 billion for double click?
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   Or $3.1 billion?
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.120]   And now Microsoft has purchased an online ad agency, a quantitative for $6 billion, the
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.320]   largest acquisition Microsoft's ever made.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.320]   Yeah, that's just a good buy-out.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.080]   We got all this money and we put it aside for Yahoo!
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.680]   What else can we get?
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.240]   I think this shows you the strength of online advertising, how all the players now are lining
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.040]   up, including other agencies and media entities, which are buying up these online agencies
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.800]   as quickly as they can, scooping them up.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.440]   Everybody obviously believes that the next big thing is online advertising.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.360]   And yeah, are they looking to buy Bebo as well?
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.720]   Yeah, now Bebo is a music site, right?
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.000]   No, I think it's social networking.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.560]   It's like a Facebook.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.320]   Yeah, it's like a UK version of Facebook.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.080]   I think it loads people in the UK use Bebo.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.640]   It was the number one search result for 2006 on Google and I had never heard of it.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.800]   In fact, that's the only reason I know of Bebo.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.200]   Everybody's looking at the ones looking at Bebo.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   You ever get this?
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   Yeah, you're British.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   What is Bebo?
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   It looks kind of junky.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.440]   Oh, it's like Myspace.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.720]   A junky Myspace.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.600]   It does look a little awkward.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   That would be great.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.600]   Is it bebebo.com?
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600]   What is this?
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.600]   No, this is it.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   This is the things we're getting up.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.760]   Holy on CBS.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.200]   It's out of San Francisco.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   You know, they're a San Francisco company.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.680]   Really?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.480]   Looks like I can meet some nice chicks there.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   There's Beboers or Zetby Boers.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   Can't tell.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   Beboers.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   Beboers.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   Behours.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.480]   Stay safe.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.960]   Be gobo.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.680]   It does look exactly like my space.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.560]   So why would Yahoo even want this?
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.560]   Because they like for a font.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.640]   They like the font.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.240]   It's a nice font.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.080]   You kind of wonder whether Yahoo.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.080]   The rumor is $1 billion.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   Is this worth $1 billion?
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   No.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.920]   I could see Feedburner for $100 billion.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.400]   That's got a lot of users.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   It's a good business.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   It's an infrastructure company.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   It's not a service company.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   It's an infrastructure company.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   Those do really well.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   There's revenue model there.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.400]   I don't know what Bebo is all about.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   It's fun to say what Bebo is all about.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.960]   Hey, Nathaniel, look what Bebo is all about.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.440]   That's beautiful.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.440]   Beautiful.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.960]   Hey there, dude.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.520]   A.C.S. has been circumvented again.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   Yay.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520]   Again.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.200]   This time they have circumvented the unreleased version.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.520]   They've already cracked it before it's even out.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   Well, yes.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.280]   Of a good movie.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   They cracked what?
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   The Matrix?
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   Well, because the trilogy...
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   The Trillinger.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   You're in 9F9.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   He got revoked, right?
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.360]   The Matrix coming out from the end of May won't work with the 0.9F9 key.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.120]   So they already cracked the new key.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.120]   So they've got nothing.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.200]   But they can't change it.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   The A.C.S.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.600]   terms mean you can't change it for another 90 days.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.480]   So it's cracked and there's at least 90 days until they can fix it.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.200]   How does Sliceoft stay in business?
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   I don't understand.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.720]   It's awesome, isn't it?
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.440]   They break their software into two components.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.960]   One that they can sell anywhere and one that they can sell in Trinidad and Tobago.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.760]   Thanks to the internet, you can download it from anywhere.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   It's amazing.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   It's amazing.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.560]   That's why they don't have one product.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.840]   They have one product that will take any DVD from their DVD unlocking product.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:39.160]   They will sell you a product that will rip any unlocked DVD into video files, but it
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.840]   doesn't work with protected DVDs.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.560]   Oh, but there's this other product that they happen to have that will tear in any DVD and
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   protected DVD and make it look to the O.S.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.560]   As though it's unlocked.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   Including High Def and Blu-ray.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   Right.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   And you look at...
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   I was about to make an assumption.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:03.120]   When I was writing a book about DVD ripping, of course, trying to write about DVD rippers
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.160]   for Windows is you're trying to hit a moving target.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.640]   Oh, yeah, because they're all going out of business every five minutes and another
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   one's coming along.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.600]   But Sliceoft has been just ticking along, ticking along, ticking along.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.840]   Well, I want to thank Sliceoft for a link to Twit.TV on the front page.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.840]   Oh, they're awesome.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.360]   Yeah, but wait a minute.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.680]   I feel like I'm a sitting duck now.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.760]   They're going to come on or a sitting fox.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.760]   They're going to come along and...
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.040]   I mean, it's like, "Oh, we're in Trinidad and Tobago."
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.920]   But if you want to go after somebody in the States, here's the Leo Laporte recommending
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.480]   you use it.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   It's very nice down there.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.480]   You've been on those Mediterranean cruises, curving cruises.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.840]   I'm moving to Trinidad and Tobago.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.840]   Oh, boy.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.840]   Did you see that?
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.840]   Did you see that?
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:47.360]   Listen to the NADVDA success story watching HD DVD videos with that HTC compliant hardware
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.120]   by Paul Therot and Leo Laport.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.760]   More podcasts by Paul Therot at Twit.TV right on the front page.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.960]   That's brilliant.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.600]   I'm just waiting for Zennel to come on.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   Oh, then, Leo, if you click on it, they've got a link to the MP3 of it.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.760]   You can listen to it directly.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.760]   Paul Throp podcast.mp3.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:11.240]   I'll tell you what, for all the Twit listeners out there, we need to suddenly have a secret
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.640]   code word for when you've been compromised by Homeland Security or the MPAA or something.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:21.320]   When you do a podcast on Lotus123, a look back, that's your cue that you're being wiretapped.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.320]   Okay.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.840]   So, listeners take that with a grain of salt.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   It's Lotus123.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   Okay.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.840]   I'll look back.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.240]   Just say that once now and maybe they won't hear this episode.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   Okay.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.040]   As soon as you see, right because they're listening now, but...
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   Well, it's in Windows machines.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   What's the little things they're downloading?
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:41.480]   So, if soon as I do that podcast, you'll know that anything I say from then on is Homeland
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.080]   Security speaking and not me.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   Bizarro speak.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   Bizarro speak.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.080]   I'm love.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   Love.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   Protection.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   Copy.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.080]   D.R.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.760]   Well, I think you wouldn't even need that secret code when I start saying, you know, copy
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.760]   protection is not that bad.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.760]   Like a simple one.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   It's a simple one.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.760]   It's a universal.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   It's consumer enablement.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.680]   It's all consumer enablement.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.680]   It's good.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.240]   Microsoft and part of it's a region, the ongoing search to outreach and empower its customers.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.680]   I don't lock up.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.040]   If I say the word empower, right there, that's it.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   That's a sign.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.760]   Myra Gay, here's a story you won't hear on the new tweet once they get a hold of me.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.760]   The pirate base.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.400]   That's another special episode we should do.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.920]   We should hear the entire sellout compromise show where everything we say is just to get
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.080]   advertisers, just to get investors, and just to make sure that any outstanding warrants
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   get cleared up.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.560]   April 1st, we'll do that.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   That's a stee-nose.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:41.240]   Randall did a quick research, and he says business.com sold for in 1999 for 7.5 million.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   Yep.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.480]   Now it's almost a directory site for you to plug in the URL.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   Isn't that funny?
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.320]   Hey, here are some links about business.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   Oh, man.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.000]   But now sex.com, I think sex.com was the most expensive ever, and that one.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.600]   Yeah, what about broadcast.com there?
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   Yeah, Mark Cuban's living on that one.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.600]   I'm just pleased to hear who now.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.600]   Yeah, living on that one.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.760]   Pirate Bay is going to launch a streaming video site.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.320]   They say their process of building a YouTube competitor that, of course, won't care what
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.160]   Viacom says, and I'm looking forward to that.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   That makes perfect sense, right?
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.160]   I mean--
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.160]   Can show you a DMCA if you--
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   Because YouTube is increasingly going to be compromised.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.200]   And just so-- say, just be safe.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.200]   We're pirate.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.200]   We're stealing this stuff.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.200]   Come on over.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   And you can't get us because we're on a-- wherever they are.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.200]   We're trying to get that to big one.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   Next slide, folks.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   Sweet.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   Same condo complex.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.760]   You can do to stop that, but I really can't condone a site whose purpose it is to violate
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   copyright.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.760]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   I mean, I can't condone that.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   Even though--
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   Well, you go there.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.160]   Sometimes violation of copyright is actually best for the industry that's being, you know,
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.840]   pirated from, but I just can't condone that.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.800]   Well, I think what you're seeing here, though, is the side effect of these companies holding
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   on so tight.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:04.960]   If they would just relax and do-- you know, what EMI is doing, do DRM-free stuff, or just,
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.520]   you know, look, I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.840]   When I go on to iTunes, the first thing I do when I want to see a TV show is I go to
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.160]   iTunes to see if I could buy it.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   I prefer to buy it.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   I would rather buy it.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.520]   I will buy it if I can.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.560]   If it's not on iTunes, then it's up for grabs.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.560]   I don't know.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.160]   I might, you know, I might download it somewhere.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.200]   But I always go to iTunes first, and I don't think I'm alone.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.040]   I think people would prefer to get it legitimately and pay for it if it's reasonable, and it
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.000]   doesn't have a lot of copy protection on it.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.320]   But if you don't let us do that, then you're going to get the pirate pay.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:39.360]   You may actually have a slightly different tune, though, not to mention on iTunes, but
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.280]   suppose whatever you want to watch three years from now, and you show us to follow three
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.480]   years from now, doesn't have the same copy of protections with iTunes is selling you
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.320]   today, you might have a different tune than that.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.080]   Will it get worse or better?
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.760]   Well, no, because you won't want to have to pay for it twice.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   Right.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.160]   So even though right now you go to iTunes first, because--
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.880]   Well, that's why I think there should be no DRM.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.800]   But even now, I'm willing to put up with some DRM, some less-onerous DRM, just because
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   I want to buy it.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.280]   I think that's a measure more of the fact that, and I think most people are this way,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.960]   that they want to be honest, and they'll even put up with something they don't like,
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.320]   as long as it's not too-onerous.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.280]   But I really don't understand why people won't even sell it at all.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.040]   Yeah, the other thing that, and again, to stick up a little bit for these pirate sites
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.760]   and putting up illegal videos on YouTube, there is so much content that's absolutely
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.520]   orphaned, and that is a game.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.080]   There's so many TV shows that will never come to TV.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.640]   One of my favorite bootleg videos of all time, The Flying Car Masa of Brothers did a three-hour
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.160]   version of the Comedy of Errors with like 20 VOD Villains, like, they're all jugglers.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.640]   The funniest shows I've ever seen.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   They're great.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   I love them.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   They've been on PBS.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.040]   Unfortunately, it was alive at Lincoln Center because of the agreements they make for it
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.080]   to broadcast live from that facility.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.080]   Right.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   PBS can air it exactly once.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.960]   The member stations can record it and re-air it once during that week, and then it disappears.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.680]   And no one can see this now.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.840]   So on that basis, I'm sort of okay if there's no alternative, the alternative being that
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:07.320]   this wonderful piece of art that so many people were so very hard on, this thing should not
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   be allowed to die.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.040]   And on that basis, these sharing sites have a really, really good reason to be.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:16.720]   But really, the selfish reason that why I go to iTunes first is because these sharing
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.040]   sites just kind of suck.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   Right.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.560]   You know, PDP, you think, "Oh, great.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.640]   Here's the show that I wanted to see."
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.880]   And then it's like three hours later, it got hung up at 98%, and it's like, "Oh, geez.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   Why the hell did I bother?"
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   Well, I'll give you a good example.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.520]   We were talking last week about Stephen Fry.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.160]   And I learned about Fry and Lori, and this is great, and I love Stephen Fry.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.720]   And so I find out he does a TV show on the BBC called "Quite Interesting Man."
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   I'd love to get that show.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   Right.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.560]   Can't find it.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.560]   Look everywhere.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   What's your funny story?
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   Huh?
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.000]   I'm going to see that filming on Thursday.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Are you?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   I'm so jealous.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   It's a fresh friend of mine works there.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   It looks fantastic.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.360]   Would you please ask him why they don't make it available to buy or purchase or download?
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.720]   For crying out loud, how much do you guys pay in license fees to the BBC anyway?
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.880]   It should be free.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.200]   Yeah, right.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.280]   So I think it's going to be going up when the BBC gets it's playing a thing.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.280]   That new I-FIF.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   Yeah, but that will be Windows only.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.280]   You should also work on Max, right?
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   Right.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.280]   Right.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.280]   It's ridiculous.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   It's like an interview.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.520]   You won't be requiring my license fee.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.160]   If they sold it for a buck, how much money are they leaving on the table?
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.320]   I would have bought it for a buck and episode.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.080]   It's not just the buck and episode, it's the control over the viewership saying you're
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.200]   coming to my site to download this.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.880]   You can learn about other programming we have available and maybe you can see some
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.120]   ads that we're going to be charging people to put up on the site.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.320]   The buck is great, but you want to control who gets to see it and how they see it.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.480]   You don't want to see someone put up like an eighth generation ripped off of some really
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   crappy, kind of cabled.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.480]   That's right.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.280]   They want a pure digital- And that's Corey Doctor's point is it's too late.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:52.720]   If you don't do this, that's the version that's going to get distributed.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.720]   It's too late.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.720]   You're giving this away on broadcast for free.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.200]   Of course, you can't stop people from doing that.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   So why are you trying to do it?
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.440]   Why are you trying to do it after the fact?
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.480]   The carts are already left to barn.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.560]   I mean, that's another generational thing.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:12.520]   I think that there's a generation of people who are younger than 20 years old, maybe even
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.160]   younger than 18 years old, there's that generation of the ones that come after it are starting
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   to lose the connection between paying for content.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.440]   Not because they're dishonest, but because they never had to.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.440]   They never had to.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.920]   They grew up in a world in which this stuff was available.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.360]   It simply is their reality.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.720]   Just like I grew up in a world in which you could certainly assume, I grew up in a world
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.680]   in which there was always tape decks.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.600]   You can always make a copy of whatever it is, whatever CD you bought.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.720]   You can always mix it together into your own mix.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.640]   That's why MP3s just took off like a house of fire because it was what we were used to
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.280]   only taken to the next level.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.520]   So when old dinosaurs, old elderly dinosaurs like me, they start to make a fuss about
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.560]   copyrights and saying, "Well, geez, pirate Bay is not that good.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.880]   It's possible that I'm one of this generation that just is not going to ever understand
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.640]   the importance of paying for, excuse me, the last generation to understand the importance
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   of paying for content."
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   Right.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.240]   Maybe that's because that's why I want to pay because I'm old and the next generation
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   won't.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   They even offer a deal.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   Because I write for newspapers.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.440]   But you guys create content, like I create content, we have a different view of the whole
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   thing too.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.160]   Well, those kids are going to create content.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   I mean, they're going to grow up.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.760]   They're going to mix up some stuff.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.360]   And they're going to say, "Well, I had to get all this stuff for free in order for
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.680]   me to have my mashup of it."
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.720]   And they're going to think their mashup doesn't have any value.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.720]   They just share it.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:26.040]   I remember when JEXE's Midnight Runners did that song.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.040]   Come on, man.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.040]   Come on, I lean.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.040]   Come on, I lean.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   I lean number eight.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.840]   Sir Ripser that.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.840]   Sir Ripser a lot.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.000]   I leaned over.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   I go to the Q1 site.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.680]   I'm going to get on my belt just getting a little stale.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   I go to the Q1 site.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.680]   I can't download anywhere.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.680]   I go to the Q1 site.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.160]   It says DVD is available the first season.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]   I'm great.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   And guess what?
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   Region two encoded.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   Yeah, I can't even.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.160]   I can't even.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.360]   It's like, and then of course, what's the quote of the week on the front page?
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.560]   The Q1 quote of the day, "Never was anything great achieved without danger."
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.760]   Niccolo Machiavelli.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   So there.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   I'm stealing that thing's being decided.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.760]   So you're going today this week to see it.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   That's great.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   Easily available.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.760]   Right.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.760]   Those old nude thumbnails.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.800]   Google won a big court case.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:25.880]   The problem was that they were displaying nude thumbnails in their image search.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.560]   There's actually a thumbnail fetish site.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.720]   Just knuckles, just fingertips.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.720]   Ooh, thumbnails.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.720]   Bob, it's just nude thumbs.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.720]   Dude thumbs.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.280]   Perfect 10, which is a porn site.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:42.840]   A dude saying, you know, you can see the perfect 10 girls in thumbnail form thanks to Google's
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.840]   image search.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.680]   And we want them to stop doing that.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.320]   For entire person's perfect.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.760]   That's hot.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.080]   That's all you need to thumbnail, baby.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.880]   A federal appeals court Wednesday cleared Google to resume posting tiny versions of nude
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.960]   photos.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.840]   So congratulations, Google on that big, big victory.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.360]   Hey, when there's a thumbnails that 10 in binary?
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.160]   Oh, one instead of one.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.160]   One zero.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.160]   Yes, two.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.000]   Perfect two.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.080]   So I tell you, it's a pet.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.680]   If you look old, oh God.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:21.640]   What if Google reached a compromise?
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.120]   Let's add a new feature of the search engine that digitally adds a photo of room.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.720]   It can't plan hand over the heads of all the people that come out.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.520]   You wouldn't want to see it.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.120]   Just to take her soft.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.520]   Nice rack with that face.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   Ooh.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.520]   That grew.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.040]   What happened to your nose?
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.560]   Great, great, great rack.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.560]   Wow.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   Wow.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.080]   Is that like the first nose job ever done?
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.680]   We were suggesting that maybe they should do ASCII versions of thumbnails.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.680]   Aski porn.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.680]   Aski porn.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.680]   Well, just description.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.880]   I think Andy had this description.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:55.360]   Yeah, I just say, Candy is slowly mixing a picture.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.360]   Imlets her hair is slightly tousled but still tied in the back.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.360]   She's wearing a camisole.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.800]   One's getting strapped to the slide.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   She's never so slowly off her left shoulder.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.080]   But she's grabbed the right shoulder because she doesn't want the other one to drop.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.640]   I think I like her.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   All right, that'll do.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.440]   I don't need no pictures.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.840]   I think my head, the mind is the biggest sex organ.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.840]   Well, not the biggest but the speaker side.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.120]   In Leo's case.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.760]   Imagine using Amazon hits to do all those translations.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.120]   That would be crazy.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.960]   No, use the Turk.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.760]   Use the Turk, right?
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.080]   Let's see, Blizzard announces StarCraft II.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   I love StarCraft.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.240]   What a great game.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.880]   I mean, I'm played in the ages.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.000]   This is, we're not talking in the world of StarCraft though, right?
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   It's not an online game.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.960]   No, no, no, it's a direct sequel.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.480]   I mean, StarCraft is still a massively popular game on the professional gaming circuit.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   Is it really?
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:53.200]   Because it's generally considered to be one of the last really pure RTS games.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.200]   There's such a good game.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.680]   Guys, I have the crazy keyboard macro fingers running.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.680]   Right.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.280]   It's still one of the most popular games ever.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:10.000]   If you've ever, I've gone to these internet cafes.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.400]   It's a place like Toronto and others where there's a large Asian population and you'll
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.760]   go in and there's 20 people playing this game.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.880]   It's scary because they're so fast.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.840]   They're playing against each other.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.080]   I would be, I would be, I tried to play against these guys.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.920]   I mean, it's a different game entirely.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   They're right.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:32.000]   Build order and getting the right macro set of.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   It's bonkers.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.240]   Excuse me, I just had a little explosion here.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.440]   My exercise ball popped.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.640]   Too many thumbnails.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.120]   Whoa.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.880]   That's incredible.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.280]   The room of planning Hannah Macra would have prevented that tragedy.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   Wow.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.480]   It's good I wasn't bouncing at the time.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.560]   I really would have hurt myself.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   All right.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.200]   I wish I was watching the webcam.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.840]   I'm recovering now.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.840]   Wow.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   That was an experience.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   Did you hear that?
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.840]   Yes.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   That's pretty crazy.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.840]   Okay.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.840]   It's a soul.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.920]   And six million souls credit and anguish and then we're silenced.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:21.080]   I think it was the Zerg that did it.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.080]   So have you played the Starcraft to anybody?
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   Anybody take?
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   I've heard the reviews.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.560]   It looks, you know, it's the same game.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   It's just more.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.640]   No, it's not out for a good while yet.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.600]   Now what is out and I know you've been playing a Halo 3.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.440]   Tell us about that.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.680]   Well, it's a lot of fun.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.160]   This is a beta download, right?
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   It's not the officials.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.120]   So you can get the beta by, there's a game called Crackdown.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.840]   When you put Crackdown in, you can like download it through like the menu system, which basically
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.400]   are the only reason that anybody bought Crackdown I think.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:57.920]   And like the beta is just just under a thousand megabytes.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:03.240]   And it's three levels and it's deathmatch and you get to play like capture the flag or
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.280]   just deathmatch or the different like, you know, sniper only or rocket launcher only
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.080]   whatever across these three levels.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:15.280]   Is there, does anybody have a fitness exploding fitness ball because that would be the ultimate
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.560]   weapon of doom?
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.520]   No, unfortunately, unfortunately, no.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.240]   It's pretty much the same as Halo 2.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.560]   Well, that's what everybody's saying.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.000]   In fact, even the graphics aren't that much better is what I'm hearing.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.640]   No, unfortunately, I mean, hopefully it'll get started up a bit.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.800]   But I mean, it's, there are some subtle differences.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:37.120]   You know, there's little bits of new equipment and weapons and stuff that, and new vehicles
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.720]   and stuff that make a little bit of difference.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:44.080]   But it's sort of like mostly more of the same, but on steroids and, you know, in HD.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.600]   And you think that people are really excited to see that there's still active development
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.200]   of this game that their favorite game isn't going to be taken away from them?
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.880]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.000]   You know, the thing that cracks me up is that the actual thing is coming out in September.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Halo 3 itself, I mean, Halo 1 itself wasn't, to me, that innovative.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.440]   It was very reminiscent of an earlier bungee game that I used to play.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.400]   Marathon, which is a great game.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.160]   And frankly, Halo 1 was just marathon.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.880]   Well, people seem to be really compelled by the storyline more than anything else.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.480]   The gameplay is really wonderful, but it's the environments, the characters you get to
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.480]   play.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.680]   I know this is true just nearly everywhere, PG.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:28.280]   But I think that the Halo soldiers are the first like video game themed characters outside
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   a Lara Croft.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   I saw a comic book in mentions.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.640]   And that's not an easy costume to make for God.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   Who is that?
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.000]   I think one of the master chief is that his name?
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.200]   Is that the guy master chief?
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   Yeah, master chief.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.040]   One of the big things about the original Halo was it was one of the first games to mix,
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:47.920]   like the kind of doom style like crazily claustrophobic interiors.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.400]   And you could go into those and then suddenly walk seamlessly outside into a massive open
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   air environment.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.400]   And then which is not easy to do.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.600]   That was like, you know, massive load times.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.520]   And you could never go outside outside and do them or whatever.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.640]   Well, in fact, in the old days, an engine either was an indoor engine or an outdoor engine.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.640]   You didn't.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.640]   Right, exactly.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.120]   And Halo did both seamlessly.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.560]   And it was just, you know, that was the mind blowing thing.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   We had a lot of fun.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:16.200]   I remember on the set of the screen savers with Halo 2.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.680]   We used to play land games all the time.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.320]   In fact, sometimes the show wouldn't would actually we'd be in the middle of the game
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.320]   and the show would begin.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.200]   And we'd kind of like, we didn't really want to start the show.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.400]   We were, you know, it's a live show.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   It has to begin.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.360]   But people would say, okay, go ahead and just start the show.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.120]   I'll be right there and continue the game.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.040]   And I remember Kevin Rose must have spent hours.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.320]   Was it Kevin or maybe it was a Joshua and Brantana, whatever.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.800]   I think it was Joshua and Brantana, whatever producers must have spent hours.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:45.040]   He figured out how you could line up eight jeeps in a circle facing each other and hit
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.720]   it just right with a bazooka that they'd all flip in synchronous.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.560]   It's just crazy.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.800]   It's just crazy.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.520]   That's just way too much time wasted.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.360]   You need ballet music with that.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.200]   It was straight out of that.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:03.520]   There's a filthy term that I'm not going to use right now, but I need to purge that
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.000]   image from my mind.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Okay.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.960]   I'll go to the Urban Dictionary if you just type it into the chat room and I'll look
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.680]   at it because I don't know these terms.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.480]   You know, I'm a different era.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:18.160]   Apparently, summer camp, that's a common activity, not in the camps that I went to fortunately.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.160]   Okay.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.560]   Now my mind's going somewhere.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.040]   I'm not sure I want it to go.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.000]   So I'm sure where your listeners will explain.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.760]   They all know what you're talking about.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.280]   I'm going, what you talking about?
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.600]   So Halo 3 going to be worth waiting for, worth buying.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   I think it's safe.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.360]   If you played it all weekend, it must be.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.800]   It's going to be the end of the trilogy storyline.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.880]   And it's going to be the most popular game on Xbox Live for the next 24 months.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.880]   Only because...
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.880]   So.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.520]   Only because Spore is not out yet.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.720]   Actually, you know what?
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.560]   Halo 3 on Xbox Live would be a lot of fun.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.560]   You know what?
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.320]   Will you meet me in Xbox Live and we can have a Twit tournament?
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.320]   Yeah, that'd be rock.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.920]   And then it'll be like the screensavers, we'd say, "We've got to start Twit, but just
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   a second.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.520]   There's one more thing to blow up here."
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.720]   Well, hey, if we all get the Xbox Live cameras, then we could all film each other in kind
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.560]   of like a virtual tournament.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.640]   Ooh, that'd be something to watch.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.640]   Geez.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.200]   Maybe the Department of Homeland Security should come get me now.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   I'm playing Halo then.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.480]   I love watching the whole video games.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.080]   Yeah, it's so much fun.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:30.040]   There's a reason why even like the national championships don't even make it to ESPN 7.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.400]   You know, it's funny.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.720]   Every time somebody starts a tech network, they go, "Oh."
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.360]   And you know what the best part's going to be?
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.600]   We're going to have video game tournaments on TV.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.600]   This is a...
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.920]   That's what I love the most about that South Park Ips, so they took place in Warcraft.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:43.920]   Yes.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.720]   That guy, I have walked in offices and seen that guy in eight copies of them all in one
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.080]   like Q-Book will farm.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.760]   There's nothing less lively than somebody playing a video game.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.240]   They just looked like they've done.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   Exactly.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.800]   They have these chairs that are designed so that, well, you know, I bet I can just move
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.320]   my fingers and have every other part of my body support.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.040]   Well, actually, I just need the outermost two phalanges.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.000]   I don't need to move the first knuckle.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   That's wasted effort.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.760]   Yes, the new Catatonia chair.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.560]   You have the catheter and everything, so you're just ready to go.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.560]   Herman Miller presents...
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.760]   I want the cleaning staff to come and water me.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.600]   That's how little I want to actually move while I'm playing this game.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.400]   Could you please blow oxygen in my direction?
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.280]   Thank you.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.520]   The Committee on Homeland Security called this week for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:36.000]   to investigate the cause of excessive network traffic, a data storm that shut down an Alabama
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.640]   nuclear plant.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.680]   It happened last August.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:44.920]   Unit three of the Brown's Fairey Nuclear Power Plant, they shut down the reactor after
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.080]   a two-water recirc pumps failed.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:55.160]   The recirc pumps failed because the controllers for the pumps locked up because of a spike
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.720]   in data traffic.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.320]   The deluge of traffic was apparently caused by a malfunctioning control device.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.400]   Too much data.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.240]   Now see, it turns out Ted Stevens was right.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.240]   It is tubes.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.240]   It's all tubes.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.240]   It's all tubes.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.080]   I think it was Joshua playing tic-tac-toe.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.680]   Look, I can blow up the Xs in there.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   A funny game.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.680]   It's kind of hulkin.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.560]   The only way to win is not to win.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.400]   Now we play a name.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.760]   I guess we've kind of wrapped up this edition of Twitter.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:31.840]   Any other stories anybody would like to comment on?
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:35.720]   I'm still my tailbone is still hurting from the earlier...
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.520]   Oh, they just exploded.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.560]   You need to take that video and put it on YouTube.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.560]   I don't know what else you do.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.280]   I have to say what it looks like.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.880]   I just disappeared, I think.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:44.880]   I think it just...
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:50.440]   I think that should be your first literal 50-dollar Outback Steakhouse for the first
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.000]   good video mash-up of that video.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.800]   Have you been knocked down by the Star Wars Kid and Stephen Colbert?
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:03.520]   Stephen Colbert punk-bringer, exercise causes trouble.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.520]   Trouble.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.880]   You say, "Hey, you know when..."
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.520]   Don't even eat cookies with fruit in it.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.520]   Just nothing but chemicals.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.520]   It lives forever.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.520]   It's right.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.520]   It's killing you.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:16.360]   Andy Inako is at the Chicago Sun Times and he's a great guy to have on.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.040]   We're going to have you on back on Mac Break Weekly soon.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.920]   Not this week because we're doing it live in studio.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.920]   There's no room for you.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.400]   I need the five-second delay just like Richard Pryor on Saturday.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   That's right.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.400]   We don't do it live with Andy because you never know what he's going to say.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.080]   The dinner show after 10.30.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.280]   We will have you back on Mac Break Weekly the following week though.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.320]   It's been great having you on Twitch.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:43.200]   I look for Andy on the colossal waste of bandwidth network, cwob.com.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   Is it .com?
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.200]   .com.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:49.280]   Unfortunately, .biz and .tv were already taken.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.520]   I had a settle for the .com.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:51.920]   Tarrin, I hate it when that happens.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   No dot in the phone.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   No dot names.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   No dot names.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920]   [laughter]
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.000]   And just remember, "Better is the enemy of the good."
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.600]   That's right there on the front page there.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.080]   Andy is smiling face.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.280]   And of course, his columns in the Chicago Sun Times regularly.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:12.000]   Randall Schwartz is the author of so many 250-some magazine articles also, of course, learning
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.600]   Pearl and many great Pearl volumes, "Purls of Wisdom" from Randall and the Geek News'
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.640]   Cruises, which is available on iTunes.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.640]   Where on the west?
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   Podcast.geekcruises.com.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.440]   What's the next cruise?
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.640]   The next cruise is next week of all things.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.280]   We're going to Alaska, yeah.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.680]   That was a fun cruise.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.680]   A wonderful cruise.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.020]   What kind of cruise is it?
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:37.760]   It's Mac and photography, I think.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.000]   Actually, you know, aperture, artifact or something like that.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   Aperture something.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   And then these products are getting harder to alliterate, aren't they Randall?
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.880]   Well, good thing I don't come up with it.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.640]   Actually, Neil's wife comes up with all those.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.640]   Really?
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.240]   There's a great job of these alliterations, yeah.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.240]   Teresa does all of those?
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.240]   Like, where?
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   All those, yes.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.040]   It's Pearl-whirl and I love them.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.040]   Opera Odyssey.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.080]   We don't do a cruise on X.203.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.080]   X.203.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.080]   Beautiful, yeah.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:11.280]   You know, they're doing an insurance cruise in the fall in the Eastern Caribbean.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.280]   I know it's...
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.280]   They did not come up...
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:16.680]   The captain's gonna get such an email from the lawyers of the cruise line.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.560]   Okay, look, these are all insurance people.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.320]   They did not come up with a clever name for this.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.320]   No, it's just...
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.080]   For God's sakes, make sure all the carpets are laid down, make sure there aren't any
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.480]   nails sticking up from anywhere.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.960]   Fire that cook that we were supposed to fire two years ago.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.960]   But you know the one I want to go on is the poker passion.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   That's in...
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Early, too.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   Oh, yeah, that's gonna be good.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   That'll be fun.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.400]   And of course, don't forget Magmaemia 7, which is a Panama Canal cruise in November.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   Port of that one, too.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.800]   And we've got two going into the Mediterranean next year.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.200]   So that's gonna be a lot of fun, too.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.200]   Yeah, wow.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.200]   All right, thank you, Neil.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.200]   Thank you, Randall.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.000]   That's the other guy.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   He was channeling Captain Neil for a while there.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Thank you, Randall Schwartz.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   It's great to talk to you.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.200]   Podcast.decreuses.com and we'll see you on Jaikku.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   Also thanks.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   Merlin, M-E-R-L-Y-N.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   That's Jaikku.com.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:07.000]   I figure if I'm channeling before, I gotta get all my URLs in here.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.600]   Get the URLs in.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   And we'll hear us.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.840]   I-L-H-A-R-I-S.CO.UK.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.240]   That is the new home for Will Harris.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.000]   Are you officially gone from BitNet?
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   BitTech?
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.640]   And working on exciting new projects.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.600]   Internet video, Internet TV.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:32.840]   Yeah, if anybody is good at hacking at WordPress templates, try me a line because that'd be
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.840]   great.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:34.840]   That's great.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.840]   And where's Will?
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.440]   Is at willharris.co.uk.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:42.880]   And I understand there's a clip coming your way of a guy on an exploding fitness ball.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.480]   That should be something you'll want to catch.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.840]   If we mix up with the exploding whale, that'll be kind of cool.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.400]   Next time we're going to fill the ball with Butane first.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:56.480]   Hey, we finally came up with something for the 100th show.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.720]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.520]   We do invite you to visit twit.tv where you'll see a chance to buy some of these great Scotty
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.520]   Vest.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.000]   We've got, oh, I just got the new polo shirt.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   They're great fast.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.320]   And you guys, the new Twit polo shirts are fantastic.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.320]   You look good.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.200]   We also have fleeces for those of you down under who are heading into winter.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:17.720]   You might want one of those and great Twit caps too with special hiding spots for your
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.220]   iPod.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.380]   All of that at Twit.tv.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:25.240]   Don't forget while you're there that your donations keep this podcast afloat.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.280]   And anything that you can contribute is much appreciated.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.920]   That's a pace for the bandwidth, storage and a new fitness ball for me.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920]   I thank you everybody.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.920]   We'll see you next time.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.720]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   [MUSIC]
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.920]   Round the morning.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.720]   Wasn't he like the lounge act and the last cruiser out together?
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   [LAUGH]
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:00.080]   Mr. And I've got a spreadsheet built in paradise.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.240]   I'm going to eat from out of town.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.400]   Kidding, it's a boat you're all from out of town.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.400]   Which reminds me of a song by Mr. Paul Askles.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.400]   [LAUGH]
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.400]   [MUSIC]
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:15.400]   I'm just trying to get the thing off but I have a hell of a time when blue screens like forget it.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   I'm killing you.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   [MUSIC]
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.400]   Round the morning.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.400]   [MUSIC]
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.400]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.400]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.400]   I'm on the Twit, baby.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.400]   I'm on the Twit, baby.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   I'm on the Twit, baby.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.400]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.400]   I'm on the Twit, baby.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.780]   >> All right, baby.
