[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   It's time for Twit and this week has been crazy!
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.720]   Apple's dropped some eye goodness on us.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.920]   Google is in deep water for pay inequality.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.480]   Should Facebook be the gatekeeper for democracy?
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.160]   And Foxconn goes all cheesehead.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160]   Coming up next on Twit.

[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.200]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.480]   This is the show that releases more important.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.400]   Vital crucial data and Equifax.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.800]   It's going to be quite the show as this was a super busy week from Apple's newest
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.560]   announcements to Google dealing with a record find to Uber behaving badly.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.480]   Again, we've got the perfect panel to break it all down into brain size chunks
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.080]   of data starting on my left with Dr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.440]   He is a journalist, public speaker leading voice in online news and
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.760]   a professor at the Cooney School of Journalism in New York.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.160]   Jeff, this I think is the first time I've actually had you on a show that I've been involved in.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.200]   I'm delighted for more reasons because who was supposed to be that chair today?
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.040]   Mr. Kelly Canis.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040]   He became ill.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.120]   So basically I went from a devil to an angel.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.280]   [LAUGH]
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.680]   And this makes me very happy.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.120]   I'm sorry that Jason is ill.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.440]   I feel bad for you, Jason, but I feel kind of good to have you here.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.160]   I think he would actually accept the phrase devil investor.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   I think he would.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   That would be a new one.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.000]   Demon investor.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.040]   I think that would fit right along with his next book, Angel Devil, right?
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.880]   There we go.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.000]   We've of course also got Mark Millian.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.200]   He is Bloomberg's technology writer and editor.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.000]   He is also, I would say, quite possibly the fountain of youth in the Twits TV studios right now.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.840]   Mark, I have worked with you before.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840]   How have you been?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.120]   I've been great and I enjoyed your sick burn against Equifax.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.960]   That's really good.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.640]   Equifax is, oh, we're going to talk about it, but it is the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.480]   If by gift you mean black eyes and it's max across the house.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.720]   Of course, it can't just be those folks who are in the studio.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.160]   We needed to bring in someone who could really break down the knowledge into what we need.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.200]   Of course that's got to be, oh, doctor.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.480]   It's O and J.J.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.480]   Stone.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.480]   Today, I have not worked with you in years and it is an absolute pleasure to see you again.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.760]   Although I have to say, the last time I saw you, you had sort of a bookcase cat anime background
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.480]   going on and now you seem very minimalist.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.120]   Well, with the Equifax leak and me being on the dark web, I mean, I got to reallocate
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.920]   my social security number and the situation I find myself in, you know, the internet is
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.280]   out here trying to find people.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   So I'm just trying to hide out.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   So that is, hold up.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.080]   But Charlie Rose is studio over there.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   Hey, look, and to this whole thing blows over.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.200]   I mean, admin, admin password is out here floating around.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.720]   We got some big issues on the internet right now.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.120]   So better safe than sorry, gentlemen.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.640]   We will get to that story in a bit.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.120]   But I have to say, I was a little sad that the password wasn't one, two, three, four,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   five.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.560]   I mean, seriously, that would have been just the geek squeeze.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.040]   They threw a six on the end.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.600]   They threw a six on the end.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.160]   Let's go ahead and dive straight in.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.240]   Let's start with where I think a lot of people are starting, whether or not they're fans
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   of Apple.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.680]   Apple did make some significant announcements this week, not just in product, but also
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.600]   in policy and in pricing.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.160]   So let's jump into what we know.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.560]   We know that they released three phones.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.200]   We've got the iPhone eight and the iPhone eight plus both are nice.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Many people are saying that could just as well be the seven and the seven plus.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.640]   They've up the technology a little bit.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.920]   It uses Apple's new a 11, the bionic processor with six cores, two of which are low performance,
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.680]   four of which are high performance.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   It's got a new 12 megapixel camera with optical stabilization with Apple signal processing.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.960]   So they say they've up their low light performance, a new portrait mode, which I kind of like
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.680]   because it's got it's basically a filter before a filter.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.040]   It can actually detect what a scene is like and choose the right settings for that and
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.840]   a 3000 milliamp hour battery.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.600]   So it's going to last long.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.760]   It's going to be faster.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.860]   It's got an all glass back.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.440]   Let's start with that because obviously we want to get to the X, but are we impressed
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.680]   with the eight eight plus?
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.680]   Have you pre ordered?
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.680]   Are you ready to buy it?
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.640]   JJ, is this going to be your next phone?
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.040]   I'll let everybody else go first.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.840]   I'm going to last.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840]   Okay.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840]   Okay.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   Wow.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   He's going to sit on that for a while.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840]   Mark, what do you think?
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   I mean, it's a decent five.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.600]   This is like comparable to any of their other, you know, step step along phones that they do
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   each year.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.880]   The all glass back is a nice throwback to the four, which I thought is probably one of
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.560]   the most attractive phones ever made.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.480]   This is not the phone that you can keep the model straight.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.240]   Well, that was the one that gives Moto Leaked.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.240]   That was the classic phone.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.560]   And also it was strange because when they went away from the glass backing, it had a
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.800]   couple of people scratching their heads thinking, so now it looks like every other phone again.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.680]   With that glass back, it was unique.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.280]   And yes, it had a couple of issues that had to be sorted out.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   Yeah, Tenna.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.600]   But also glass is more susceptible to breaking.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.000]   So when you put glass on both sides, you've got like a Faber J.A.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.600]   that you're trying to carry around.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.360]   So from a practical perspective, we'll see how strong this glass is.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.080]   I look forward to the inevitable YouTube videos of people trying to smash it when it comes
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.580]   out.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.240]   But it's a fine phone.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.520]   This is not the phone that the people who listen to this show are interested in, I don't
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.520]   think.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.880]   I would be interested in, but it's a decent phone.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.160]   And the addition of wireless charging, I think they're really moving in that direction for
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   a lot of their products.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.880]   So that's going to be an interesting move for our fans.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.520]   They're going to keep the seven on sale at a much lower price.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.480]   What are they going to have to offer?
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   Yeah, they did announce their pricing.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.960]   And so they are dropping everything.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.120]   But they're keeping the sevens, the eights and the 10.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   Actually it goes all the way.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.120]   You can get down to the six.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120]   You can get the six.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   Wow.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.120]   I have to say if I had a six, I would not feel a great urge to upgrade.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.440]   If I had a seven plus, I would definitely not feel the urge to upgrade.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.480]   It is the eight plus looks just like the seven plus.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.640]   It is slightly faster, but the seven plus was already so fast and the screen was so wonderful
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.960]   that unless I really, really, really wanted wireless charging, which I don't, I don't
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.440]   see as a big thing.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.200]   I've had wireless charging on a lot of phones.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.760]   And sure, it's nice every once in a while, but the difference between putting on the platform
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.640]   and just plugging into a cable, that was never a huge thing.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.760]   I think they're not even releasing the mat until next year.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.880]   So it's a standard.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.880]   Why would they wait?
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880]   It's key charging.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.880]   It's key charging.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   You need to buy a third party mat.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.880]   Well, there won't be as good.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.880]   Won't be as pretty.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.720]   Won't be as sleek.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.360]   The pricing we know is going to be a little bit higher for the eight, which is a 4.7 inch
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   screen.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.000]   It's 1334 by 750.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.760]   You can either get the 64 or the 256 gigabyte version for 700 or 850.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.360]   And then the plus, which has the 5.5 inch screen, that's a full HD 1920 by 1080, 64
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.960]   or 256 gigabyte for 800 or 950.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.800]   So yeah, that's the lower of the phones announced.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   That's the lower the phones announced.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.120]   So let's, let's go ahead and let's jump to the X because I'm sorry, the 10, my bad, my
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.120]   bad.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.120]   Let's jump to the 10.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.960]   Oh, and you wanted to jump in on the eights, right?
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   It sucks.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   It's the same thing.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.640]   I mean, I am so tired of Apple's marketing.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.880]   Apple has the best marketing in the world.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.680]   And you say the same thing every year.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.320]   Oh, wireless charging.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.320]   Cool story.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.040]   My grandma was doing that back in 2012.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   A glass back.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.560]   Oh yeah, it looks sexy until you break it.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   Forget the YouTube videos.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.360]   The average user always breaks that glass backing.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.200]   When you had the metal backing, sure you had a little bend gate or whatever crap that
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   was.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.800]   But at least it took a dent and it kept on ticket.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.400]   Now when you break the glass and you cut your thumb on the back of it because Lord knows
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.600]   after people that have a regular job, they want to spend $200 to send the phone back and
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.240]   to get fixed because most people don't get the Apple care because they buy it through
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   their self over riders.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.400]   So that's just one more thing to break.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.840]   I don't care how gorilla super duper, Hooperman, this glass is going to be, it's breakable
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   glass.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.160]   It's like, why?
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.400]   You made the same phone and you had the nerve to skip the seven S and just call it eight.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.800]   Then you're going to come out with an edge.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.000]   Who is running this monkey show over there anymore?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.040]   I miss Steve so much every day it is insane.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.080]   Like who cares about the eight?
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080]   Nobody.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.360]   You can dim the lights on my picture.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   Cool story, bro.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.720]   I got Lightroom for $9.99 a month.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   Let's talk about this X.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.040]   Okay, but I mean, to address that, you're still in the fence though.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.800]   It sounds like he's on the fence.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   People are going to buy this phone.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   People are going to line up to buy this phone to resell this phone to make money off this
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   phone thinking they need this phone.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   They don't.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.640]   They don't spend $41 a month on this stupid phone and don't have life insurance.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.600]   Like I understand the people on the bottom phone, but my goodness.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   Samsung and Nexus and Google and everybody in their mom who makes a phone has been doing
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   this.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.280]   I mean, the new X looks like an HTC phone from six years ago with that stupid looping hoop
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   at the top.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   Let's talk about it.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.280]   Okay.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.600]   Let's go ahead and go to the 10 because that's actually that looping hoop is what everyone
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   has been talking about.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.240]   Ugly in the front of the sex appeal designers of the world.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.880]   You put devil horns on the top of my foot.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.440]   You have to thin out the two caps when I'm watching a full screen video of myself on
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.400]   Twitter with the black background.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   This is ridiculous.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   Come on.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.120]   But wait, it's the new thing and it's beautiful and everyone's going to love it because it's
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.640]   a 5.8 inch screen.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.600]   It's 2436 by 1125.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.280]   It's OLED edge to edge except for the notch and except for the notch and they say they
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.800]   are very excited about it.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.280]   And it's only $50 more than the highest of the eight.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.760]   So why wouldn't you wait for 10?
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.240]   Because it's only got 64 gigs of space and again, my grandmother had more space than
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.640]   that back in 1942.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.640]   What are you doing?
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.280]   We're trying to $1000 for 64 gigs when you have a phone that's not upgradable in space
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.280]   capacity.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.280]   Like that's ridiculous.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.200]   Like you really just ripping people off knowing that they're going to line up and buy this
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.800]   stupid phone and then the next jump is up to 256.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.360]   It should have been what we you everybody on that panel knows it should have been 128
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   for a thousand dollars.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   Come on.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   Let's go.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   This is true.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.960]   This is why I'm waiting for the nine.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   Ain't no nine.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.960]   We passed that.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.760]   We're going to the LOP now.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.760]   We can't do nine now.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.760]   We can't do it.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   We can't do it.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.760]   We can do it.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   X one and a nine.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.760]   They can move it.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   They can move it.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.760]   They can do the X and then the Y.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.760]   They're going to go.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   Whatever.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   What do you do?
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   11x.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760]   X.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   I like I think the nine is going to be one of those lost models like the Xbox 720 or Windows 9.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   Windows 9.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   It's just just no.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.760]   We're just going to pretend like that number doesn't exist.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:22.160]   No, but let me ask you about this because JJ makes a very good point from the people
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.280]   who have been watching technology and are kind of agnostic about their handset.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.120]   The announcements that Apple put out OLED screen, wireless charging, bigger battery, those have
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.360]   been features that have been available on other phones from Android and Microsoft for
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.720]   years now, literally years.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.840]   And yet it's a premium on the iPhone 10.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   Is that right?
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   It's justifiable.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.800]   I mean, it doesn't seem to be stopping pre-sales.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.240]   People are still jumping out there.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.240]   It still has a buzz.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.480]   People still want to spend their money.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.680]   They're lamenting the fact that there are going to be a line.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.240]   Are we going to see people sleeping?
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   Absolutely.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.040]   There's going to be a line that's alive for sure.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.720]   Well, I think they'll be aligned for the eight, even for the eight.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.360]   And the people who are buying the eight, the only reason why they're buying the eight
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.120]   is because the X, the 10 won't come out until November.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.480]   But also to save money.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.880]   I mean, some people don't feel like they're not allowed a month.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.880]   There's not a difference.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   It's not great.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880]   It's several hundred dollars.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.040]   I mean, the top of the line eight plus is two hundred dollars less than the top of the
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.000]   line 10.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.880]   And I mean, when you're when you're already spending eight, nine hundred dollars, that's
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   not a whole lot.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   But the seven, the seven sold more than the seven plus.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.520]   So you would assume that the regular eight to fit to most people's hands is going to
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.680]   be the unit that sells more as the eight.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   Comes out too.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.720]   So yes, at the top end of the eight plus, which isn't the max majority of users.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.440]   So that price there is a big jump for the majority of people that usually buy the iPhone.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   Right.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:57.480]   So when was the last thing that Apple announced that excited you?
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.280]   The Apple Watch.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   And then I got unexcited.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   Yeah, real quickly.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.280]   Okay.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.920]   Well, we can come back to the phones because I mean, there are so many programs that have
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.920]   covered the phones.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.280]   I think people understand the price breakdown and this is this is Apple.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.360]   I mean, people will buy it.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.000]   It will still be a blockbuster product.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.880]   Even if there are people looking at this going, I don't understand why so expensive.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.760]   The face detection is significant if it works the way it is.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   And oh, yes.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.760]   No one's done that.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   No one's done that.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.800]   Let's let's cover that really quickly because they did come up with an excuse.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   They they they they.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   I know what I was going to say.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   I want to cut it off before he does it.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.760]   I'm not going to say it's like had it.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.440]   You hold up a Polaroid of somebody's face and it unlocks it for you.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.440]   If Apple can do it where it actually maps faces, that's a big deal.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   Okay.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   Cool.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.440]   So they're mapping faces.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   Let me just tell you a couple scenarios.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.240]   I may or may not have had a criminal past in my life, but let's I get into altercation
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   with the police.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.240]   I tape it on my phone.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   I try to lock my phone up.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.000]   I'm in the backseat of the cop car.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.600]   They hold my phone up to the back window and boom, delete all the videos.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.280]   I took it and beaten up me and my friend and thrown us in the ditch.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   I know that I supposed to.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.080]   I know there's laws against that, but we've seen that happen in the past.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.440]   Secondly, I'm in here trying to creep on a conversation at my office and maybe play,
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.560]   I don't know, words with friends.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.720]   And now instead of be hit my thumb on the button or need my desk, I got to look down
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.520]   and up at my phone to make sure that it gives my face.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.000]   They can still punch in your passcode.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.480]   Man, look, I'm talking about the ease ability and flexibility and the button ability.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.560]   You have me spending $1,200 on a phone and I ain't got no fingerprint reader on the back,
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.600]   like every other phone that charges you like $900 more.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.640]   Again, when you talk about design and the settings now sex everything is, I just don't
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.280]   understand why I can't still just have fingerprint reader and I got to use my face.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.200]   And there's all other kinds of reasons and problems with the face and I don't think
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   it's that cool.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   >> I can make emojis.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.120]   >> I can make emojis, yeah, one face perfect advice.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.320]   I can make emojis and make poo move and stuff like that.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.600]   My daughter is the only person I know that sends me those happy birthday balloon, laser
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.080]   light show text emojis.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.440]   So basically we're hoping kids spend $1,200 on a phone and use poo face emojis and unicorn
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440]   emoji face.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   Like come on, man.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.760]   It's again, marketing, I get it, but I don't think it's a perfected technology and there's
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.680]   a lot of problems I see on a horizon with that.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.960]   >> Now the demo did fail while they were actually showing off the facial recognition
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.280]   that it failed, but Apple did release a statement later on saying this was actually a feature.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.280]   This was not a bug.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.560]   This was not a demo fail.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.400]   What had happened, according to Apple, is that many people had handled the phone and it
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.160]   had tried to do face detection on everyone who handled it and it had poor phone.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.160]   >> It had air down.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.160]   >> Well, exactly.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.320]   It aired out so many times that it locked itself, which is a security feature.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   You want that.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.320]   >> I can't wait.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.400]   >> So when I go into the men's room now, don't worry.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   >> And where we don't?
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.080]   >> I try to go into the sink.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.400]   I'm going like this.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   It thinks I'm a zombie or something.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   I don't exist.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   I get to try to get the paper towel.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.240]   It doesn't exist.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.800]   I'm afraid that if I had this phone, it would just say you're not real.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.440]   >> No, hey Owen, can I look at your iPhone X?
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.440]   Not dog.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   Too many faces look at it.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   It locks up.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.440]   I can't really show you.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.120]   About we just show you the back of my phone and you can look at the camera that's actually
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.320]   a Samsung camera, but that's neither here nor there.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.840]   Let's not talk about licensing.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.000]   But we can just look at the back of it.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   You'll get the gist.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   There's horns at the top.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Like, come on.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.280]   >> Actually, I do want to address one point that you did bring up, Owen, and that is unlocking
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280]   the phone.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.200]   >> Lily wants to unlock the phone right now, we know that biometric data is not actually
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   protected.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.960]   So they cannot demand that you enter in your pen.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.440]   I'm sure they could throw you in jail until you do, but they cannot demand that you give
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   them your password.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.120]   However, your fingerprint and your face are not protected.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.800]   It's not covered under the Fourth Amendment, right?
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.280]   So by that logic, the phone should also not have a biometric fingerprint reader.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.680]   If you're really concerned about that.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.000]   If I'm dealing with somebody, at least I can go like this to protect somebody from taking
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.440]   my fingers when I'm getting put into a squad car and unlocking my phone.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.840]   When they just go like this, you're beat and they're into your phone.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.200]   So yes, I get the gist of it.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.400]   Like I said, somebody steals your phone from you.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   They hold you up.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.320]   You're still staying there because they've got a gun on you.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.840]   They take their phone, they can unlock your phone and then go away.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.840]   Not to be paranoid.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.440]   >> Hey, look, I'm just saying Jeff, Jeff, come on, let's not say anyway.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.040]   Just little things, we got to find out what's going on.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.640]   I just want a fingerprint reader.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   I saw.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   >> Okay, on the back.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.440]   >> That's a very nice, it's on my nice pixel.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.840]   >> And since they made the button out of physical button, you could have just put the circle
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.040]   with a little line around it and made it flat to the back of the phone and still touch it
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.440]   because your button is a real button.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.160]   Anyway, you could have some sleek, sexy design and say, hey, you still want to use your
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.320]   finger, guy, use your finger, dog, we got you.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.360]   >> Maybe you should have just had stroke the notch.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   >> Yeah, you go.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   >> That's your title.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.040]   >> That's not so like that.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.280]   >> So the notch, the notch.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.440]   Android watches that have the flat tire.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.440]   >> Right.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   >> Irritated the hack out of me.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.680]   >> It was bad design.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.040]   It was just trying to solve a problem.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.960]   It was the definition of a Cluge.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.720]   The notch is a Cluge, right?
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   >> It's just a Cluge.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   >> I'm absolutely down with that.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.440]   I don't see how that little bit of real estate at the top can be anything but a way to
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.840]   say, no, we're edge to edge.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.440]   It's not useful screen, right?
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.160]   I mean, you can't put anything to that that's going to look good.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.520]   It's always going to be that notch.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:30.520]   >> I mean, is there any way to technically put a speaker and a camera and under screen
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520]   at that part of the screen?
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   I mean, it's just a-
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   >> But I mean, that's not where they're going to put it.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   They're going to always going to put it down fire.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.280]   >> You could have a little, you know, kilowatt was here.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   >> Bump.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:45.280]   >> I could see some great, some great screens, skins being put onto this thing.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.080]   >> Again, you just run the line across the top like the galaxy does.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.920]   And yes, I could hold a parrot up to my galaxy to open up with my face.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.240]   But I mean, again, all this technology is old and they wisewoose it and make it sound
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.200]   sexy and people go buy it.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.640]   But at the end of the day, it's just not exciting.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   And for people who are in the know, like really, what am I supposed to be excited about?
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.400]   We're going to talk about all the other stuff.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   But everything we're going to say about Apple has been done by other people and other
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.160]   devices for years now.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.880]   Apple TV, cool story, bro.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.400]   4K just came out yesterday.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.560]   All right, you had a device that came out a year and a half, two years ago, where 4K
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.120]   was still popping and you didn't, okay, a watch.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   You got to set your service.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.960]   You're going to have a dude surfing in the ocean when you put the smallest water protection
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   meters on your phones.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.120]   You don't only go three feet with an iPhone, you can go six or whatever, 10 feet with a
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   galaxy phone.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.520]   Like Apple just does the bare minimum to try and make something sound like it's something
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   and it's just not.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.880]   And at the end of the day, I got an iPhone 7.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.880]   I'm a loser too.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   I know I'm hip to the scene.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.960]   I'm a crack head to the ecosystem.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.320]   I got a max.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.360]   So my counters, everything blings and who's like an iPad.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.280]   I get it, but I'm stuck on here and get excited about it and act like it's something cool
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   and ain't don't.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.160]   So are you going to buy one of the new ones?
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.160]   No.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.160]   Well, actually, let's break this down here.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.600]   I know, okay, oh, and I know you use an iPhone.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.080]   Jeff, I know you use an iPhone.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.080]   Mark, what are you?
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.080]   That's right.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.080]   You've got a pixel.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.080]   Google.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080]   I'm Android, Mark.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.080]   I got an iPhone 7.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   Okay, so we're split 50/50.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.240]   Well, I'm waiting to see what the new Pixel is going to be about.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.760]   And if I don't like that, I'm just going to wait for a Samsung next year to come out
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.960]   with the iPhone XI and I'm going to get that because I'm not going to get this iPhone
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.960]   X.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.760]   Are you what's your odds making?
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.720]   I'm going to go ahead here, but the Pixel you think is going to be good?
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.720]   I love the Pixel.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.120]   A lot of my friends have the Pixel.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.280]   I think the Pixel is a sexy, thin, fast phone.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.280]   Yes, I am sexy.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.600]   It's just like you, Jeff.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.560]   They modeled it after the Jeff.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.560]   That's right.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.560]   They called the Jeff Pixel.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.560]   Go word.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   Jeff Pixel 2.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.560]   I'm a JJ to you.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   There you go.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.560]   It's a great phone.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   It is.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.560]   It really is wonderful.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.480]   I'm waiting to see what the next one is.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.560]   And if that doesn't move me, I'm switching to Android.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.120]   So it's got to happen.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.120]   I'm finally done.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120]   Apple's not going to get me anymore.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.200]   I do want to cover some of the other bits of the announcement because of course there was
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.320]   the Apple Watch, which oh, and it had you excited back in series two for a while for
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   a while.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.760]   This is new in that it has an LTE radio.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.120]   And this has been hinted at for a while.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.480]   I actually know some of the people who made this happen.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.000]   It's been a challenge because of battery life and because of RF design, but they think
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.280]   they finally got it nailed down.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:33.880]   Does this make it a different product because it had previously been tied to your phone?
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.680]   You had to have an iPhone to make this thing work properly.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.840]   Does the fact that now I can leave my phone at home make this?
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.040]   Like you're ever going to leave your phone at home?
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   This is true.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.040]   Hey, this is true.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   Aren't you?
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.760]   Don't you feel naked without your phone?
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.360]   I predict this is going to be one of their best selling items.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   Really?
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   Okay.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   One main reason.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.440]   So my daughter, again, I'm in the tech bubble for certain things.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.560]   She's had an iPhone touch or whatever, since she was three.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.560]   She's had her own device.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.720]   She's had her own capability of text messaging and all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.600]   The biggest thing is why I switched her to a phone when she was six.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.800]   So I could track her.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   So I know where she's at.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   I know what she's doing.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   She's always got a signal.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.000]   She doesn't need to be on Wi-Fi.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.200]   If I could have given surveillance dad.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   For what?
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   Mutter dad.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   Oh man, that's going to be on and popping.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.680]   You know how many people have iPhones have kids and don't want to give their child a
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.000]   cell phone, but they can say, hey, you can listen to kids, Bob, on your watch with some
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.120]   headphones or that little speaker.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   And if there's an emergency, I could call you.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.800]   And if Kalamazoo rolls up to the park with a candy van, I can lease tracking down the
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   street.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.720]   You're an Apple Watch that throws it out the window.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.600]   But this device is great for children.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.640]   It's an actual functioning device that works.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.760]   There's a lot of other kids watches that they sell you and they usually charge $39 a month.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:54.040]   There's a Mickey Mouse Club watch, but there's no closeness to the technology that's in this
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   thing.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.680]   And some of those watches go for $200.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.280]   So I think this is going to be a big hit.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.280]   This one run.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.280]   This actually would show.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   Oh, this is what?
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   $300?
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.280]   $499 for $99 for out.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   That's it.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.280]   Right.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   For the radio.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   And $10 a month.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.280]   $10 a month for the plan.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.160]   It's completely untethered or do you need to set it up with the phone and have it.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.160]   It's on its own.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.160]   It's got its own.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.800]   But you still need an iPhone to set it up.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   Okay.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   So you can run without the iPhone.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.760]   It can be connected without the iPhone, but I don't know how you're going to set it up
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.880]   unless you're using an iOS device.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.360]   That's how you actually get it set up.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.160]   Well, I figured I figured most people that would buy it would be people that would buy.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.800]   Well, here's my thing though.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.640]   We have had a DC watch that's been connected for a long time.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:45.520]   At IFA, they released the Samsung Gear S3, which had an LTE radio, had great battery
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.080]   life, multi-day battery life.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.200]   And the big selling point was it's no longer tethered to the phone.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.160]   It's been a popular watch, but very few people are using the LTE features, very few apps
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.840]   are utilizing the LTE features because they realize if I'm not going to do a text message
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.960]   on my watch, I'm going to pull my phone out and do it that way.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.840]   I'm not going to do anything on my watch if I've got my phone because it's so much easier
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.160]   to enter the data.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.520]   I'm wondering if that holds over to the Apple Watch crowd or did Apple actually do something
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.880]   that's going to make this really work without a phone?
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.240]   You know what Apple does?
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   Marketing.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.240]   True.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.600]   They've also got a premium customer base that doesn't care about spending an extra
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   hundred bucks to get the cellular monitor or $10 a month to pay for the cell service.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.440]   For me personally, it could not get enough use out of it to warrant $10 a month.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.480]   But I think there are enough Apple customers who would just spring for it because they
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.120]   get the top of the line thing.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.120]   I don't get it.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.440]   I don't get the need for that because I'm going to have my phone with me everywhere.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.800]   And like Howard Stern, I'd be afraid of getting wrist cancer.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.920]   Even when you're surfing, Jeff, you didn't see the commercial dudes out there surfing.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   Also says dinner's ready.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   He's like, "Hello, how mama?"
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.920]   And he comes in.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.280]   Like, you know, there's, again, marketing is the difference with Apple and Samsung when
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.000]   it comes to their accessories.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.320]   Apple makes you think that you need it.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.880]   And more people than not, like you said, our premium customers are going to buy it.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.360]   Them say, "Oh, sure, I'll do the $10 at six months at some point, maybe turn it off or
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.520]   figure out that they like it."
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.880]   Hey, you're going to the gym.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.280]   You put your playlist on.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.720]   You don't have to carry your phone around with you.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   You could lock it up in the closet and keep it moving.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.440]   Like, there's a lot of different things that make that.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.080]   I think that's a big use case that Apple's targeting is work out and exercise.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.760]   And they're really like going after the Nike niche, which is like creating an aspirational
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.240]   brand and an aspirational product, which is like, buy this thing, you'll go and work
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.960]   out and you'll listen to music on it while you're working out.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.200]   We're the same people who buy Nike like never go to the gym.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.200]   And it works.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   It works.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.600]   Apple has made a fortune on that.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.200]   They don't have to have the biggest specs or the newest tech or the greatest design, even
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.000]   though some people think it is the greatest design, they just have to sell an experience.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.240]   And the experience that they sell is second to none right now.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.800]   So does this fit the experience?
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.960]   Is the connected watch going to make you a better athlete, a better mother, a better
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.360]   parent, a better whatever?
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.600]   And I think you can make a pretty good case that they've done that.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.040]   I mean, people will pay a premium even if they won't actually use a feature because they
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.440]   like to think that they could use the feature.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.280]   I think there's some crazy stat, like 78% of people that sign up for memberships at the
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.000]   gym only go twice a year.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.160]   So I mean, it's a business model.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.520]   Yeah, it's a business model.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.360]   You sell to people, you sell to lifestyle.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   It's going to make them feel better.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.520]   You know, hey, I kind of have many steps today.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.800]   Oh, wow, that's horrible stuff.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   So I need to take this watch off.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   I'm embarrassed.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.440]   It's like subscribing to the economist of the New Yorker.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.160]   It just piles up guilt.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   Yes.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   Yes.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.200]   There could be a new Apple Watch that counts your steps twice or three times for an extra
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   $50 a month.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   I mean, that'd be nice.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.240]   Again, you have, like I said, everything about all this stuff just drives me crazy.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.520]   So they tell you that they have lightning charging now.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.880]   It doesn't come with a lightning charger.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.440]   It still comes with the small block and then you've got to buy a new block that's like
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.680]   the size of my fist to get the lightning charging.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.640]   Like if they were so brave, they should just be like, look, we're switching over to Type
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   C for the phones now.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.120]   Like we want everything to be lightning.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120]   We want everything to be faster.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.680]   It's going to be better for you.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   No, we're going.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.680]   Are they going?
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:29.200]   I predict the X, I or the Y or the 11 or whatever the heck it is, is going to have no orifice
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   in us.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   Whoa.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.680]   It is going to be absolutely solid.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   Whoa.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.800]   I mean, that's, that's Apple's dream, right?
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.240]   Apple's always wanted that and they could do it now with wireless charging.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.120]   And people will still buy it in droves and they will line up for it and say, look at
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.680]   my phone has none of the things that your phone has.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.440]   It will finally be waterproof.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.760]   I don't think I've ever heard anyone describe a port as an orifice.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.880]   I was going to let that slide, Mark.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.960]   I was really, we were like 30 seconds past it.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.200]   You just went right back to it.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.600]   Couldn't let it go.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.920]   The thing of it too is, okay, so you're going to wire the charge and cool story.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.560]   Good thing I got to cellular watch because it's going to take me four days to charge
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.560]   my phone.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.120]   I'll be back next week to pick it up and use it again for a day before the battery dies.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.680]   Well, I'm just thinking data transfer because if you're connecting to your phone via Bluetooth
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.360]   or even Wi-Fi, it's going to take a long time to move things on and off versus just being
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.200]   wired on wired in.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   That's how I do it now.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   People don't really do that very much.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   Yeah, I don't wire.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.760]   They go to the cloud too.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.640]   Well, because my phone is also my storage device.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.360]   Of course, okay, I'm Android, but when I'm traveling, it is a fantastic way to move a
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   lot of people.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   You look like a USB stick.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.640]   But it's always on me.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:46.080]   So I know if someone is trying to copy off my USB sticks, like happened the last time I
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   was in a certain Asian nation when my USB sticks in my room were not the same ones that
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.080]   I left there.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.080]   Wow.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   That was the weirdest experience.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.680]   Kind of stoned documents he carrying it.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   Nothing.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.600]   It was all just documents for what I was doing on that job, but that was just strange.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.320]   Okay, let's move away from the conspiracy stuff because there is another Apple story
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.640]   here that I think we should touch on.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.680]   And that is the reformatting of the retail space.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.200]   Apple is of the mind, speaking of experience, that the Apple experience needs to be more
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.960]   than just buying stuff.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.200]   That was the old Apple.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:27.800]   The new Apple is a town square where we can have discussions about politics and humanity
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.160]   and philosophy and then buy a bunch of Apple stuff.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.160]   Is this the experience?
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.680]   Is this the new experience, the new Apple?
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   So a couple of things about this.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   One, they used to have that.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.320]   They used to have the auditoriums and the events.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:51.080]   I remember I moderated Jason Caliconis and Nick Denton at the Apple Store auditorium.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.320]   And so it was a public space where you could do that.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:59.200]   And I used to go, here's the problem.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.440]   Browsing in the old physical sense is absolutely dead.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.920]   I used to go wandering out on the board lunchtime.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.280]   I'd go out and hit the bookstore and record store.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.680]   I'll tell you what that is later.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:17.400]   I'd hit crazy eddies or I'd hit Best Buy or I'd hit the Apple store.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.200]   And years ago, there was nothing left to buy in the Apple store.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.000]   You want to have a couple of things to go in and buy.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.960]   I used to like the store at headquarters where you could get the cool t-shirt or something.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.800]   They don't think like that anymore.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.840]   All you can get is a few things that are way too expensive.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.080]   So why go in?
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.440]   I don't see it being a town square.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.560]   What do you need to be a town square?
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.160]   To actually encourage town square-like activities.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.600]   Education, talks, coffee.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:55.400]   This is like, this was a Starbucks model where they would encourage people to just come in
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.800]   and hang out and get free Wi-Fi.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   They've since moved back from that a little bit.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.680]   But I think Apple is just trying to do the same.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.040]   I don't know if they're offering all the right incentives to just point for someone to actually
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.320]   want to go there.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.960]   The only incentive is what you just said, food.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.760]   If you wanted me to go sit in Apple, let's put in a salad works or some frappe, rap
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.520]   a crappé and have me sit there and feel like I can talk to somebody.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.240]   Because I don't know, last month to Apple store, there's one something broke.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.720]   The time before that, there's one something broke.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.560]   The time before that, there's one something broke.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.880]   And other than when you look at somebody, you think they're cute or you think that they're
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.640]   insanely weird looking, you don't even pay attention to other people.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.720]   I'm here to do what I do and get out.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.120]   Like nobody's going in there to talk.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.320]   Have you seen the comments section on Facebook and you think you want to have a town square?
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.000]   Granted, Apple is usually in an affluent area, but you still think that you want to have
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.120]   a town square where people talk into each other and become friends over Apple devices?
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.840]   Who makes, I need to get a check with these people.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.520]   I need to go sit on a board and just throw out these frivolous stupid things because
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.040]   they got way too much money, way too much time in their hands.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   Nobody's trying to sit in Apple and have a conversation.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.440]   You're better off, give me a free cup of coffee if I come in there and sit for 10 minutes.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.800]   Other than that, I don't think this is going to work.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.000]   J.C. Calhoun in our chat room has a good point.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.720]   He said, "Look, for something to be a town square, an actual town square, it has to
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:18.360]   be public because if it's private space, if it's private property, you could get kicked
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.920]   off for any reason.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   It's entirely up to that."
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.280]   I think J.J. is going to go in there and start complaining and he'll get kicked out.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   There he go.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   And then we know it's not a town square.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   That was true story.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.760]   All right.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.360]   One last Apple story before we move on, I promise we have to move on because other things
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.640]   happened in the tech world, other than Apple.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.240]   I don't think that's my attitude, too.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.240]   We got to get this money.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.760]   We got to get the money, but I want to do one more story, one more quick story because
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.600]   actually it's kind of fun.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:50.120]   And that is Apple thinking about a $3 billion bid for Bain Capital's stake of Toshiba.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.280]   Now we know that Toshiba has been trying to sell off their chip division because they
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:59.680]   had a disastrous year with their nuclear power division and they need to pay for it.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.120]   Now Apple, I think the timing is perfect for them because they are undergoing shortages
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   of NAND parts.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.560]   Everyone is undergoing shortages of NAND parts.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:13.600]   That's why they bumped the price of the iPad Pro by $50 because the manufacturers right
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.800]   now are switching over to a 3D NAND process, which is starting to constrain the supply
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.640]   of flash memory.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.600]   Apple is looking at flash memory as the last main component that they really don't have
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.040]   control over.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.520]   They make their own CPU.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.960]   They make their own image processor.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.720]   They make their own DSPs.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:38.600]   They have their own semi-private facilities for creating all the structure needed for
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.640]   their devices, but the NAND is not theirs.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   So does this make sense?
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.560]   The thing that bothers me about this is the factory capacity that they're looking to
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.040]   buy will ultimately need to be upgraded to 3D NAND as well.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.520]   So they're not just paying $3 billion for Toshiba's equipment.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:01.920]   They're also paying an additional $2 to $3 billion in the future to upgrade all of that
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.480]   to 3D capacity.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.960]   They have, pardon me, more money than the Pope.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960]   They do.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.240]   So why not spend some?
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.040]   But they're not known for spending money frivolously.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.800]   Even beats, they're going to make money off of it.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.640]   They don't do many deals.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:24.280]   And especially they don't really buy into the components industry usually.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:29.360]   They do chip design now, but they don't actually manufacture the chips.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.800]   They outsource that for other companies to make them.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.920]   This I think is to reduce their reliance on Samsung, which has a dominant position in
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   this industry.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:46.080]   And they feel like they're going to get squeezed if they don't find an alternative.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.040]   This has always been an Apple trade.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.600]   They want to own the core technologies.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.600]   That's why they didn't just license a processor.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.240]   They took ARM and then they made it into something of their own.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.560]   The same thing with their image processor, the same thing with their DSPs.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.720]   I think it makes sense for them to have a card that they could show to Samsung and say,
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.040]   "You better cut us a better deal.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.880]   Otherwise, we just move everything over here."
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.160]   However, at the moment, that's an empty threat because Samsung is the leader in 3D
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   NAND.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.760]   Right now, they have almost moved over their entire production capacity.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.600]   And they could say, "Well, you're two years behind us in being able to meet the 3D NAND
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.760]   demand."
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.360]   So you just blew $3 billion for a bluff.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.800]   I think Mark hit it on the head.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.000]   And maybe they're a little bit smarter than us, even though they can't do it in design.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.440]   But they do plan things well.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.920]   So I think that they have a long game that we're not seeing if they make this move.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.920]   And again, they have so much money, it doesn't matter.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.920]   It's not really a loss.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   They're just saying, "No, instead of doing something from the ground up, we have a foot
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.160]   in the ground."
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.440]   And then we make the leap next year or whatever they're going to do.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.760]   But they have to have something stirring for them to want to do this more than just a bluff,
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.760]   I think.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:58.080]   But again, got to do something because, as I said, Galaxy iPhone 8, Samsung's out here
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.960]   doing everything.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:03.200]   And it sucks for Apple in that respect.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.920]   And to be fair, the $3 billion, it's not a fire sale price, but it's close.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.600]   I mean, Toshiba really needs to dump this unit.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.560]   They've run into regulatory problems.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.840]   They've run into problems with their partner Seagate, which didn't want them to dump the
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.000]   unit.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.440]   And so even if Apple never uses the capacity, they're going to be able to sell it back for
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.080]   more than $3 billion to somebody else.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.720]   My colleagues at Bloomberg broke some news on this.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.840]   So Apple would probably come in as an investor and not sort of buy the whole thing out right.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.920]   So it would be as part of a consortium.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.640]   And to Toshiba unit could conceivably continue selling to other suppliers, it wouldn't be
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.280]   an Apple exclusive deal.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:54.360]   But I mean, Apple has shown a willingness to fall behind in order to reduce its reliance
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.360]   on a competitor.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.600]   You look at like the Google Maps.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.320]   They wanted to pull it off the iPhone.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.840]   They didn't want to renew the deal.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.840]   And they put out a Maps product that was far inferior.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.560]   A lot of it's not even.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.640]   It was entertaining to see directions that included things like drive-through Lake or
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.960]   you'll fall off bridge.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.760]   But we never saw the actual financials, but they probably saved themselves a lot of money
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.680]   by not having renegotiating that deal with Google and paying out the licensing fees for
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.240]   the Maps.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.920]   So they're a shrewd company.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.160]   And like Owen said, it could just be a long game.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.840]   Or if you waited until Google said, "Oh, we're not going to renew you."
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.160]   And then you're scrambling to make your own thing.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.960]   Like I said, they play long games for things.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   And I just can't stand making that move without having some sort of purpose.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.080]   I don't believe in them as far as design, but I believe in them as far as making money.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.080]   They make that money.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:53.000]   And if you look at Apple in terms of the industry as a whole, of course, their sales and their
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.280]   marketing is second to none.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.000]   But also, they're logistics.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.520]   Especially long chain logistics looking far into the future has been the envy of everyone
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.720]   in Silicon Valley.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.240]   They're making moves for stuff that they're not going to use for 10 years.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.040]   Yeah, that's what Tim Cook has always been good at.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.560]   That's what he did at IBM.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.120]   That was his main role at Apple until Steve Jobs stepped away.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.040]   He was just like the supply chain operations guy.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.680]   So this could be one of these things where it looks like a horrible, horrible thing until
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.080]   it looks like it's genius.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.720]   You know, one last Apple question?
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.720]   Yes.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.760]   Do we know when the visitor center is opening?
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.920]   No, I'm assuming that people like Mark are going to get the invitation before everybody
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   else.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.760]   You went to Steve Jobs' amphitheater?
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760]   I was not.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.960]   Quite a few people there are Apple reporter Alex Webb, Mark Erman, but I didn't make
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   it down.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.520]   I have to say for at least the first hour of the event, there were far more comments
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.160]   about the amphitheater than there were about any technologies being released.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   People were hyped.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.160]   They loved it.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.560]   It looks really slick from the photos.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.040]   It's like this weird underground, you know, like glass straight.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.120]   It kind of looks like the Fifth Avenue store, but in the middle of an orchard.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.480]   This way, if this, if you took the Apple logo off, all their buildings look like evil
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   layers.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.960]   Let's listen, this is like evil room.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:20.360]   I'm waiting for Skeletor to come walking down with a cane and just give off a speech.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.880]   Everything they make just seems like a Bond villain had way too much oil money from his
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.120]   family and was like, let's make everything glass and sexy.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.240]   Like, I mean, it is, but I'm just saying, you took the Apple logo off, everything they
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.720]   make looks evil.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.520]   And I think they're going to have a visitor center center, but you have to go through
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.960]   the gift shop on the way out.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.760]   And the gift shop is just $1,000 items.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.760]   There you go.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.720]   Well, gentlemen, let's move away from Apple.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   This has been great, but we do have some other news to cover.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.600]   I want to cover something non contentious, something that's nice and easy.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.480]   That's not going to cause any conflict.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.200]   That's not going to, you know, result in any screaming matches.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:01.120]   So how about after the break, we talk about Facebook potentially subverting our democracy.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   Do you?
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   Sound good?
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   Okay.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   Let's get right to that.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   Here's some messages from Uncle Leo.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.960]   Sorry to interrupt, but I want to tell you all about texture.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.880]   Oh my gosh, texture is awesome.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.280]   Texture is the Netflix for magazines.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.520]   I have to say some of the best journalism is still being done in magazines all over
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.800]   the country, all over the world.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:29.160]   And there's a, I would say every week there's something I want to read in a magazine, maybe
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.760]   one or two articles in the New Yorker or National Geographic or Vanity Fair or Rolling
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.680]   Stone or, or Billboard or Hollywood Reporter.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.560]   And the problem is if I were to subscribe to all of those, it would cost a packet.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.560]   And I certainly don't want to go out and spend all that money to get the newsstand
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.440]   editions, not to mention the coffee table clutter.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   Texture is awesome.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.840]   Put texture on your iPad or your tablet.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:59.160]   And now you've got access for a low flat rate every month to more than 200 of the best
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.160]   magazines.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.400]   National Geographic, Wired, Fast Company, PC Magazine.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.680]   What's nice about texture is they have the curated sections.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.120]   Here's highlights.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:15.440]   The Wonder of Gal Gadot from Rolling Stone or Healthy No Cook Meals from Shaper.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.960]   Discipline mistakes push over parents make from parents.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.120]   Now it makes it easy to find.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.280]   There's always something great to read.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.560]   Here's the top 10 reads.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   Here's daily news featuring Reuters.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.840]   Friends of daily roundup, of course I subscribe to the top stories in science and tech.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.520]   Billboard News, we consume reports, popular mechanics.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.520]   All my favorite magazines are in here and I don't have to buy a subscription.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.360]   I don't have to buy a newsstand issue.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.160]   And by the way, when you get the magazine on, it looks great on your tablet.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   In fact, that's why it's one of Apple's top 2016 iPad apps.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.200]   Texture gives you every page in the magazine.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.160]   You can zoom in, make it easy to read.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.000]   Images are fantastic because you can zoom in on the images.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.280]   And I have to say, if you get National Geographic or Shutterfly or any photography magazine,
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:12.760]   the print version is not nearly as good as the tablet digital version because it's not
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   screened.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.480]   You're looking at what is effectively the original photo.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.720]   I love it.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.880]   New York Magazine.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.880]   People.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.080]   Yeah, I got to read my, got to get my gossip fix.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   Thing is no one needs to know.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.800]   I just subscribed to all of them with one subscription with texture.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.440]   Get every magazine you could want, all the articles you could ever want to read.

[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.280]   Thanks Leo.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.160]   All right, let's get back to the action.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.000]   Now, we have to set some ground rules here because it's going to be very easy for us to
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.640]   go off on a political rant.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.000]   We really want to talk about the tech.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.680]   We want to talk about the policies that are in place with our online advertisers on many
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   of the news.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.680]   I think he's talking to me.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   I don't know.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   No, I'm not going to be.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   Anyone who might be listening, we do know now some of the facts behind a recent spat of
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.120]   very interesting ad buys that have been having across networks, not just at Facebook, but
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.040]   Facebook is in the crosshairs right now.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.360]   Specifically, Facebook has disclosed that roughly $100,000 worth of ads were purchased
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.880]   by fake accounts and sites that were run by known Russian troll organizations.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:49.280]   A one group was known as secure borders and it ran a site, a Facebook group, and it bought
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:55.600]   ads across many of the groups that were identified as susceptible to a nudge in voting.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.160]   In fact, Carson, if you go to my computer, these are some of the ads, ad buys that were
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.640]   showing up across Facebook.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.760]   Of course, we've seen this before.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:09.400]   You take a little bit of truth, you take a meme, and then you just kind of plaster it
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   everywhere.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.200]   There doesn't even need to be truth.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   Well, yeah, but it helps.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.200]   It's a little suspicion.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.200]   Right.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.800]   You take a little bit of suspicion.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:22.280]   So these are the kinds of ads that were being plastered across all the different ad networks.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.960]   Facebook has identified them and now people are starting to get past the shock phase
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.280]   and saying, "Why didn't you do anything about this?"
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.880]   You saw this coming.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.360]   You just took the money.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.280]   A $100,000 is what they've identified right now, but even they have admitted-
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.400]   I think Mark Warner said some was literally paid in rubles.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.400]   It's going to be more.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.400]   It's going to be way, way more.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:50.320]   So the question is here is, does Facebook have a responsibility to stop this?
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.600]   I mean, they're not a national watchdog.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.280]   They're not the ones who are trying to- who need to make sure that a foreign entity is
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.560]   not interfering in an election.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.200]   They just sell ads and they have an ad buy that they offered.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.560]   Let me jump in first.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.600]   No, no, they don't.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.440]   To be honest with you, I mean, far beyond from the American people that were not that
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:15.320]   bright, that people just fall for anything, but somebody paid money for something and
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.960]   somebody put money up to do what they wanted to do.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:22.320]   Now, you can get into the semantics, but then you start saying, "Well, when does it
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.320]   stop?"
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:27.120]   What makes your ad more viable or credible than my ad?
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.000]   I'm paying for it and how I want to manipulate it.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.200]   Some of those things are very blatant.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.040]   Like you said, there's no truth to them.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.840]   But at what point is this company supposed to say, "All right, I'm not going to take
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.400]   this money, which we don't really make money on anything anyway," besides snooping on
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.760]   everybody for an ad.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.680]   You take the money, you put the ad up.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.760]   It's not their job.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.520]   I mean, other than the bot part of it, but I mean, they don't even need to have fake
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.920]   troll ads when you say it that way.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:55.960]   They can have whatever somebody's name is sitting in a room just posting these ads.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.080]   And people are susceptible to them because a lot of Americans are dumb.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.680]   And that's just the bottom line of it.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.680]   Maybe if we spent more time and education, then people wouldn't fall for everything they
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.080]   see on the internet, but they do.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.760]   So, I mean, like, I'm not even mad at Facebook.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:14.200]   They're bigger problems that we have than Facebook manipulation on votes.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.800]   That's just me.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.920]   Let me do full disclosure here for a second.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.520]   I started the News Integrity Initiative at CUNY, which has money from Craig Newmark,
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.200]   Facebook, and the Ford Foundation and others.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.520]   So full disclosure done.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.160]   I think there's a fundamental change in the architecture of media, including advertising
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   here.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:40.200]   And we keep on trying to bring over our old presumptions of old gatekeeper mass media
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.760]   into this new world.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.280]   Google and Facebook enabled anyone to advertise anything.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.880]   That was never possible for it, right?
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.920]   PogRae's Country Jams, right?
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:56.480]   You can sell that stuff, the world around now, that was never, ever possible before.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   Well, good.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   God bless.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   It's like blogs.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.960]   Nobody could publish before YouTube.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:01.960]   Nobody could make TV shows before.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.320]   Now everybody can.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.680]   So now anybody can advertise.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.880]   As a result, you have a problem with scale.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:13.400]   And so now that anybody and everybody can advertise, that means that other bad guys
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.360]   will now manipulate the system, right?
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.920]   That's why Google had matte cuts.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.600]   That's why they had to worry about the spam.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.800]   There is an expense that these companies are going to have to go to.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.240]   I think JG, I'll agree and disagree with you to this extent.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.960]   Getting bombarded with propaganda, hate, lies, bigotry, misogyny is not a good user
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.520]   experience.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.920]   And at some level, I think that Facebook has to worry about that.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.960]   Number one, number two, I agree with you though, they put up ads.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   Anybody can buy ads?
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.200]   No, they want to buy these ads.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.120]   What I think they should be is a lot more transparent.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.560]   I think that Facebook should be revealing the ads and especially the targeting criteria
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.440]   for these ads.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.440]   Both Facebook and Google should be revealing how they are manipulated.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.040]   Thus, some people are trying to manipulate us.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.920]   Now Facebook's argument has been that legally they can't reveal it because a private
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:08.040]   privacy, but bots now have privacy, that's absurd.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.200]   So they're going to hand over the data to, they've already handed over to Mueller, they're
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.360]   going to hand over to Congress.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.840]   It's going to get out anyway.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.320]   I think Facebook should get way ahead of this and say, here's how the bad guys are
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.000]   trying to convince you.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.560]   One last point.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.840]   It's also been argued that before all political ads had to be public, you had to know what
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.240]   was what on TV or radio.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:34.520]   But that's not true because ever since the invention of direct mail and robocalls, there
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.680]   has been dark advertising around politics.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:40.080]   So there's nothing new there.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:45.520]   The company's Facebook chief among them, Google 2, like to position themselves as these neutral
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.880]   platforms, but they do police what goes on there.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.720]   When's the last time you've seen a porn ad on Facebook or Google?
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:50:02.080]   So I haven't personally looked at the foreign campaign finance law, but I don't know that
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:10.240]   Facebook is necessarily off the hook if they knew what they were taking money for.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.000]   Do you think they knew?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.520]   That's the question to me is, given the scale and given that there was Cambridge Analytic
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.680]   and all that stuff out there, because I think that's a key question.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.920]   They have known and if they knew what they obligated to do, how hard was it to know you
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.400]   think?
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:32.360]   I personally think they probably didn't know, but I think that is probably a question Mueller
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.840]   would be asking the company and asking for emails and asking for documentation related
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.840]   to these ad buys.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:45.160]   And it's not as if Cambridge Analytica's and that's been overblown in terms of its capabilities.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:53.440]   But if targeting criteria were passed over from the campaign to these Russkies, that's
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.440]   collusion.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:00.000]   Well, there is another part of the story, which is $100,000 of an ad buy is actually
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   nothing.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.560]   That is a drop in the bucket.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.600]   However, where the analytics goes crazy is how effective it was.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:13.040]   If you look at a standard ad and you expect one X efficiency, these ads were something
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.640]   like 10,000 X efficiency.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.480]   That only happens if you really know how to target it.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.480]   You had some sort of insight information.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.440]   This wasn't just shot gunning out.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.240]   You had someone in the country who was able to look at the demographics, look at the groups
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.800]   that were forming on Facebook, maybe tie that into some local grassroots groups and know
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.200]   this is a group you should target.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.120]   These are key words you should target.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.160]   And that's actually part of the Mueller investigation.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.360]   It's not necessarily where the ads happened because we know they did.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.800]   It's under whose direction.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.320]   >> And sometimes we give things a lot more credit than they deserve.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.000]   You also gotta think that the guy running for president was saying locker up and crooked
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Hillary.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.920]   So putting Hillary Clinton behind a cage and regular people getting millions of clicks
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.960]   and views on it happened without collusion, advertising money or anything.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:05.120]   It was some dude named Jebediah in a cave down in Alabama was like, lock her up.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.480]   And then he put it out there and it was a meme and it went crazy.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.840]   So I mean, yes, you have to kind of know what's going on.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.400]   But the guy that was running for president was a meme machine.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:18.800]   All he was doing was spitting out chunks of stupid information that was easily reverberated
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.920]   through like my community.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.280]   >> Doing that is completely within our laws though.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.120]   But for a foreign government to try to influence the US election is illegal.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.200]   >> Yes, I'm with you on that.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:35.080]   But again, at the same time saying as far as my feeling about Facebook's issue with it,
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.760]   you know, is it wrong?
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   Yes.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   Am I mad at Facebook?
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   No.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   >> Sure.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.520]   And as you were saying earlier about the porn is like that, there's certain filters they
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.000]   have for that kind of thing.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.160]   For a meme with words in it, they're not really checking those to make sure that it's
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   factual or not factual.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.720]   They wouldn't do anything if that was the case because I mean, people in the chat are
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.880]   talking about advertising integrity.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.880]   I don't know.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:01.080]   Apple just told me they made the greatest iPhone X name number of games.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.720]   So I mean, really, we were done with Apple.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.720]   We were done.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.960]   Hey, hey, got the loop around.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   That's good.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   That's good TV.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:12.440]   >> I think you get to argue that Facebook could not have expected this was coming and
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.840]   therefore did not build in safeguards for it.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.480]   But you can defend against this.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:22.760]   You can look for where's the money coming from and what is the type of content?
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:29.880]   And if it's a Russian source with connections to the Kremlin and it's trying to place a
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:35.320]   political ad, especially during election season, you should probably turn down that.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.520]   It's a big if you knew it had ties to the Russian money.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.320]   If you don't know that, then it is legal.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.760]   >> We know now in hindsight, because we have the chance to actually examine the data.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.760]   But I mean, doing that in real time is tricky.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.640]   They get an ungodly number of of advise.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.080]   And again, $100,000 wouldn't trip anything.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:57.800]   >> Well, to give you the scale, Occupy Democrats, which is not journalistic either is it Russian.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.560]   It's just it's just an advocacy group.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.320]   During the election, the highly election, they were they were they made just make memes.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.280]   All they do is make memes and memes video beams.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:11.640]   And they were getting between 100 and 300 million impressions a week on Facebook.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   >> Right.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   >> Gangsters.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.680]   And that was also part of the Russian campaign too.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.320]   It wasn't just like ad buys.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:24.240]   They were creating fake bought accounts to sort of like drum up these these memes organically.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.440]   Which actually ties into another bit of the Facebook story.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:34.240]   And that is we now know that there were some algorithmically generated by targets.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.520]   And remember, we're all about the purity of the algorithm.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.560]   The algorithm doesn't have any bias.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.120]   It just looks at what's popular.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.520]   And that's what it tries to sell against.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:47.200]   But because of the traffic that was running through Facebook, you had topics like Jew hater
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.960]   or black people ruin everything.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.400]   You could actually buy ads against those.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   >> You know what?
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.640]   I bet I could go in today and buy puppy killer.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   Right.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:01.200]   It's not an indication to me so much of Facebook as it is an indication of what there are awful
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.680]   people in our country talking about this crap.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   >> That's the point.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.160]   That's not Facebook's problem.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.320]   That's not their fault.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.360]   They didn't create those ad buys over those targets.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.560]   It's just an algorithm that's looking at this is all the traffic.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.240]   >> Before talking about hitting Jews.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.760]   And that's the world we're in now.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   >> Right.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.640]   And you can't really fix that unless you have a human or many humans sitting down and going,
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.240]   no, that's not something we want to sell against.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.800]   >> They have thousands of humans and they just hired thousands of moderators.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.480]   So this is something that they can fix.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.160]   And they say that they're trying to fix it.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:40.320]   And Twitter had a policy even before any of this, which failed them recently.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:46.080]   But to block offensive terms so that Twitter is not profiting off of hate.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.520]   >> Well, it's good to know that America has never paid PR companies to do propaganda
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.640]   overseas and involved with other people's countries and nations.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.920]   I mean, it's just great to know that I wait, never mind.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   >> Cool.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   >> This is true.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   >> This is true.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   >> Yeah, I forgot.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.000]   We did that my bad.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   I'm just throwing in there.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.560]   Everybody's hating other countries, but we're out here doing the same exact thing on massive
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.560]   scales.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.680]   Last time I checked, there was a good story about $500,000 the American government was
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.480]   spending on propaganda videos.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.960]   But that's neither here nor there.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.240]   Got this story wrapped up.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   We done?
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   I think so.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.720]   I think -- can we put Facebook to bed?
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.080]   I mean, yes, this is something that's going to be investigated.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:31.200]   This is something that we need to know how this happens so that they could put some preventative
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   measures into place.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.680]   However, I'm of the mind.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:39.160]   I don't know what the panel thinks, but I'm the mind that you cannot drop this on Facebook
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.160]   store.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.400]   >> Well, let me ask a different way.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:48.000]   So Google's Don't Be Evil, which was not a pronouncement from the mountain top.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.760]   It was licensed to employees to keep the company from being evil because being evil's bad
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.600]   business.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.400]   Maybe it should have been be good.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:04.880]   And in this time when there is huge pressure from competitors, from, you know, in Europe
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:11.000]   it's from publishers, here it's from Yelp, from governments going after them.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.720]   These companies, and I like them.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.120]   I'm wearing my Google T-shirt today.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.120]   It's a nice one, isn't it?
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   New York?
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   I like these companies.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:24.040]   Our books about them, I'm generally a fan of them, but they hold a huge responsibility.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.320]   They hold the internet in their hands.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.640]   They thus hold the future of society in their hands.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:32.920]   We can't make them responsible for everything, but the question is under what standards and
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:36.320]   ethics and morals do they believe they should operate?
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.720]   So if your Facebook could come along and say, well, it's illegal or illegal, no, you know,
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.880]   Facebook, I think, could come along and say we should make all political ads public and
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.480]   you do it in the bright light of day.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.120]   That'd be a principle to operate.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.120]   Right?
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.120]   Yes.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:51.280]   But another principle to operate under is free speech.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:56.720]   And that any schmoke can now sell their jam and sell their viewpoints.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:01.920]   What are the larger, and got the perfect guy here to talk about it with, what are the
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:08.640]   larger ethical considerations for these companies given where they stand in our world now?
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:15.240]   If you were their ethical consultant, what would you say to them about how they should
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.240]   operate?
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:21.440]   Well, I would say that I think we all recognize that even though you're a private company
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:26.960]   or even a publicly traded company, once you grow to an X amount of the market and you
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.760]   control a certain amount of mind share and traffic and communications that's going across
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:37.000]   the world, you cannot operate like every other company on the planet.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   That might be 100th, 1000th your size.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.440]   We've seen that with Google.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   We've seen that with Facebook.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   We've seen that with Apple.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.440]   They're in Microsoft.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:50.480]   They're held to higher standards because their decisions can have so much more weight than
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.960]   everybody else.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.600]   So the ethical consideration would be Facebook.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.240]   We understand that you're operating as a business.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:04.800]   However, because you control so much of the world's mind share, it's now your responsibility.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.240]   It's incumbent upon you as a corporation, which has been granted entity status by the
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.840]   Supreme Court of the United States to act responsibly.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:16.760]   And acting responsibly means transparency.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.280]   Maybe not being the police, but at least let people know where these things are coming
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.880]   from.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   And that's even then, even saying that much kind of brings up a bad taste of my mouth
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.240]   because it really sounds as if I'm asking Facebook to be a gatekeeper, which I don't
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.240]   want.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:36.000]   But I think we can all admit that there's something more that they're responsible for,
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.120]   that my space would never have been responsible for, right?
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.800]   There's something different?
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:50.280]   I think there's been a shift in the larger consciousness away from letting Facebook and
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.200]   Google off the hook for this type of stuff.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:58.320]   And I think they are really being held to a higher standard in the mainstream.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:03.960]   There was a Financial Times op-ed today saying that the tech companies are too powerful.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:09.680]   And this is a theme you see in a lot of the business books that are coming out now.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.600]   And I'm curious how that changing sentiment affects how they operate.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.440]   I mean, I don't know that antitrust action is going to be taken, especially from the
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:24.600]   US because it's hard to argue consumer harm and especially when so much of what they offer
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   is free.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   It's hard to-
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.720]   And there is competition for everything but the other side.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.040]   So it's not super effective competition, but it's there.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.920]   And it doesn't sound like this government is going to be the one that's going to push
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.920]   that type of case like this or-
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.640]   But you're up to regulatory.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   For sure.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   It's continuing to push hard.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   How about this?
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.640]   Let's jump to Europe next.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.640]   Okay.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.160]   Let's get off Facebook and we'll talk about some other good news like Google being fined
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.640]   a record amount of money for anti-monopolistic tendencies.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.800]   Yeah, let's do that.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.440]   But before we do that, let's jump back over to the other side of the studio because Uncle
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.600]   Leo needs to have another word with the Twitter army.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.640]   I hope you're enjoying this week's Twitter.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.080]   Sorry, I couldn't be here with you all.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.320]   Boy, this sounds like fun.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   No, you're not.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   I wanted to rep-
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.280]   Thank our sponsor ITProTV.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.160]   These guys have been with us since they started.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.000]   In fact, they're very timid on.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.240]   The founders are very clear.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.160]   They were influenced by Twit and by Tech TV before it.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.680]   They were IT trainers forever.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.880]   And they saw what we did at Twit.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.440]   And they said, you know, it'd be kind of cool to do something like that, but for IT
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.720]   professionals or people who want to become IT professionals.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.440]   And ITProTV was born.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.640]   Of course, now they far exceeded anything I ever dreamed of.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.720]   They have five studios.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.320]   They're putting out 125 hours of content, fresh content every week.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.000]   You can watch them live.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.640]   Their back catalog has thousands of hours of on-demand training in every category.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:53.800]   Certified ethical hacker, Kali Linux, Microsoft server, ITIL, AWS SysOps, a CompTIA security
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.320]   plus, all the certs that help you get the job, all the information that helps you keep
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.960]   the job at ITProTV.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.160]   And they have a team solution.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.600]   I really want to emphasize this.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:12.680]   If you work on an IT team, an ITProTV team solution gives you group pricing and a supervisor
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.600]   portal that allows you to control the training schedule, create custom groups, training assignments.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.040]   You can see individual analytics, group analytics, view logins.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.080]   You can check in on viewing time, video downloads, track course completion and more.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.880]   So you, it is a training solution, the ultimate training solution for any IT team.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.040]   And of course it's convenient because you can stream it over anything.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.960]   They've got apps for Chromecast, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, a great Apple TV app.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.400]   Of course you can watch on your PC.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.720]   You can use their iOS or Android dedicated apps.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.560]   You don't have to send your staff off site for training.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.440]   They can do it from their desk during lunch.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.200]   ITProTV.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   Here's the deal.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.040]   Go to itpro.tv/twit and you can find out how it can offer you as an individual or a
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.360]   team the best IT training solution.

[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.840]   Then once you got the job, get new skills and keep the skills you've got.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.320]   Keep them up to date with ITProTV.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.440]   If you go to itpro.tv/twit you're going to get a free seven day trial when you sign
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.240]   up for an individual monthly membership.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:24.360]   And you got to use the offer code TWIT30 because that's going to also give you 30% off your
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:30.640]   subscription for the lifetime as long as you stay active 30% off.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.000]   And if you're on a team or you run a team or you want to get something for your team,
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.320]   you can sign up for a free demo of the supervisor portal that's on itpro.tv/twit.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.280]   Make sure you tell them you heard about it on TWIT.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.280]   ITProTV.tv/twit.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.280]   Use the code TWIT30.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:52.920]   You get a free seven days and 30% off for the life of your individual membership at ITProTV.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.200]   Now back to the TWIT crew.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.120]   Leo said he was unhappy not to be here.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.120]   I don't believe him.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.120]   I don't believe him.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.120]   No, I've seen his Google+ and his Twitter feed.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.120]   He's very happy.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.120]   He's very happy.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120]   You still use Google+,?
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.120]   Whoa, wait, okay.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.720]   I didn't know it's still alive.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.360]   Some of us have great interactions on Google+, I'm just going to say it.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.920]   A place where you have only three people, of course you do.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920]   I used to love it.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   I used to adore it.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.200]   It works for some groups like our My KnowHow group.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.840]   We've got 12,000 people.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.360]   It's incredibly active.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.000]   He's, I can see him winding up.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.600]   I understand it's a ghost town in a lot of places, but one of the nice things about that
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.040]   is for the geeks and the marginalized, it's been become a great place.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.520]   I don't have to worry about extraneous messaging.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.480]   It's just what we want.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.280]   And I think that's the best thing to have to be asked to investigate that group.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:54.320]   If there's 12,000 people on a Google group, definitely hear all the bots and Russians.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.120]   They should definitely investigate that group.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.600]   I'm just saying the CIA, FBI, some by ATF, some might get in there.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600]   Just make sure everything's kosher.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   I love you, Father.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.840]   I'm just, Lord knows we got to find out what's going on to a 12,000 people.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.080]   Secondly, Google still has social media.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.320]   I've used anything on Google, besides Google photos in my email.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.400]   I don't know anything else to Google does.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.200]   So that's either here or there.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.520]   But yeah, I totally get it.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.920]   I understand.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.160]   And you're right, because a lot of the groups that I am a part of on Google+, they've emptied
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.120]   out and they've all moved over to Facebook.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.240]   But there are those of us who are loyalists until Google announces that they're going
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   to pull hanging out.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.440]   I loved Google+ in the day.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.320]   But wait, when was the day?
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.360]   The day it came out Tuesday?
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:43.560]   I was even you can't resist being cruel.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.560]   Google+.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.560]   This is true.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.480]   OK, let's do some happy Google news.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.400]   This is actually something I'm very interested in, even though we have very little details
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.400]   about it.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.280]   Google's going to announce a brand new Pixel on October 4th.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.680]   Yeah, my Pixel is quite excited.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.640]   My Pixel is quite a big topic.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.440]   This is about as much details as we have.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.480]   We know that there was a bulletin board that went up in Boston.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.720]   And all the bulletin board was to say, go to this website about Ask More.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.720]   And if you go to Ask More and ask for your email address and the last six numbers of
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.760]   your social screen-- no, that was equal facts.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.080]   --and ask your email address.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.400]   And it looks like they're going to announce a new Pixel.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.120]   Maybe a new Chromebook, maybe.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.200]   Oh, I pray.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.200]   I pray.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.200]   I pray.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.200]   I love my Chromebook Pixel.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.040]   I own four of them.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.280]   I have one now, and I love it.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   I love it.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280]   I actually love it.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   One is for my parents.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   But it's getting old.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.800]   And I'm not sure about the new ones.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.720]   So I want a high-end Chromebook.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:43.120]   I have lived entirely on Chromebook, entirely for almost three years now.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.160]   I don't know anyone who has a Pixel who doesn't like it, who doesn't like it.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.920]   Even Leo used to make fun of them.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.720]   And Growl, he now likes them.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720]   They're just incredibly--
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.720]   I live love you to Google.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:58.080]   When I travel, I carry my Pixel C, which is the tablet.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.880]   I don't even carry a laptop anymore.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.240]   OK.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.760]   I will draw my line there.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.720]   I love my Acer Chromebook.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   I have an R13, because it also does Android apps.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.560]   And it's convertible.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   And it's very low cost.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.960]   It was a $300 Chromebook.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.120]   But if I can only carry one device, it's not going to be that.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   It'll be an Acer-esque version.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   Can I ask you a tech question?
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.600]   Can I ask you a tech question?
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:27.520]   So that dialog box you get once or always, I answered wrong a few times.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:33.680]   And when I click on, let's say, a medium link or a New York Times link, it goes to the app.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.680]   And I don't want it to.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   I want it to go to the web.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.200]   And I don't know where to turn that off.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:37.880]   Right.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.600]   There's actually app preferences.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.920]   Unfortunately, it's kind of ham-handed, because unless you know exactly which
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.960]   app preference you want to reset, it resets all your app preferences.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.720]   Which I think that's wonderful design, by the way.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720]   Yeah, it is.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.720]   Anyway, anyway, anyway.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.720]   I love my Chromebook.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.720]   I want a Chromebook.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.400]   I-- but here's the-- it's a JJ question, too.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.440]   What can they do-- the Pixel's a darn good phone.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.760]   What can they do to this that'll make me spend the next $900?
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.760]   The notch.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.200]   If they put that notch at the top--
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   $1,000 phone.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.440]   And take the fingerprint off the back.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.640]   JJ is not impressed.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.360]   It's a-- I don't know.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.040]   What's the-- it's like a-- it's a sexy-born phone.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.200]   Like when you hold the phone and you use the phone, it is fast, it's responsive.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.640]   The camera is amazing.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.880]   It's just a great phone.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.640]   But it doesn't excite me, per se.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.880]   When I hold it, I feel happy when I got it in my hands.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   Again, it's more--
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880]   What do you want in life, man?
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880]   I need marketing.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.640]   I need a video of a kid in a rain doing some kind of dance that I'm never going to do.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.040]   I need paint splashing through windows and--
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040]   It's perfect.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.920]   --winking and I need the right song to go with it.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.920]   That's the only difference in these phones.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.920]   This phone-- I mean, look, I love my phone, but it's not like I'm sitting here drooling
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.360]   over this phone.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.080]   They need to do something that makes me feel good about myself having the phone.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.680]   And as stupid as that sounds, that's why Apple sells so many phones.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.480]   They make me feel important having this phone.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.560]   I feel better than most people, knowing that I got an iPhone.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.800]   The phone ain't better than other people's phones, but I feel better having that phone
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.800]   over other phones.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.960]   That's something that the Pixel needs to do.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:17.320]   But wait a minute, wait a minute here, because I have-- we have an example of a phone that
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.720]   created excitement, and it created a narrative where I have to have this because this is the
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.920]   next thing, and it's beautiful, and it's greatly designed.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.880]   It was the essential phone, which we got a copy of here.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.680]   We actually had to buy it, and it was hyped both Leo, Jason, and I.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.640]   We all wanted to take it for a spin.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.200]   We thought it was a great design.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.000]   This was going to be the Jesus phone, and it was horrible.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   Horrible.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Not just disappointed, but horrible.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   I will say horrible.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.360]   The camera didn't work right.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.200]   It crashed consistently.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.400]   The case was just a fingerprint magnet.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400]   That's all it was.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.080]   It was literally there was no place you could hold that didn't smudge the phone.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:56.160]   The performance was middling, and we managed to crack it in 24 hours.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.560]   I hate to call you a nerd, but you're a nerd.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:03.760]   If no one in the real world had any kind of hype, desire, or care for that phone.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:08.680]   I'm talking about making the world, not just myself, not just the bubble, not just you
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:13.520]   in the studio, you got that every single device that comes out on the face of the planet.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.280]   I'm talking about everybody.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.680]   When I go to the soccer field, I want that soccer model to say, I don't want this damn
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680]   song.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   I want a pixel phone.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.640]   Have you heard about the pixel phone?
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.640]   And they don't do that.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   So that's what happens with pixel.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.880]   It goes by the way, so I even know it's a sexy phone.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.880]   You're doing something smart.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.960]   One of my buddies said he has an old Nexus, and they send him some kind of email where
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.600]   if he sends his next send, they're going to send him the old pixel because the new
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.600]   pixel is coming out.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.160]   That's a great way of adoption.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.720]   Get all those old phones out of circulation and getting your stockpile out of warehouses.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.880]   But I mean, like I said, I'm talking about real people.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.000]   And I'm talking about you drawing over some fake phone that has you hyped up and Uncle
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   Leo hyped up.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.440]   Uncle Leo gets hyped up where anything will buttons on it.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   Okay.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.400]   Wait a minute, because here's the pixel is a boring device.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.200]   It is an incredibly boring device.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.320]   And I want a boring device because I don't care about the device.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.920]   It is just a tool for me to do all the incredible stuff that I get to do.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.160]   I want it to work well.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.560]   And I mean, I think that's the normal person.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.560]   What would it be?
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.560]   Why don't you have a picture?
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.360]   Because I can't afford it.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.280]   I'm still rocking a OnePlus one.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280]   Okay.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.280]   I'm holding back.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.080]   One plus phones are awesome.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.280]   I love one plus phones.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.800]   They all the RAM they give that.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.280]   That's a good solid phone.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.120]   The price is reasonable.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.640]   I tell people all the time, like if you don't have it in your budget, the problems you got
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.240]   to put the money outright most because they don't got a plan for a phone.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:38.200]   But that is a solid company putting out solid phones and over end.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.560]   And the thing that gets me most excited is every time I hear that number with RAM, that's
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.320]   the first cell phone I gave my daughter was a OnePlus phone.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.240]   So ain't no hating on them player.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.960]   Now I mean, there's a training wheels phone, but it's still it was a ball of phone.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.960]   I gave it to my other friends.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   This is my backup phone.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.320]   That phone's still living in this world.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   OnePlus.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Shout out to you.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.280]   Now, the only thing is it's not just a OnePlus one.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.000]   I have the unicorn of cell phone plans.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.520]   You cannot get it anymore.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.680]   So you have to hold on to it.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.680]   If you if you have it.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.280]   This is a prepaid, pay as you go.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:11.680]   $30 a month, T-Mobile unlimited data, high speed and 100 minutes of voice.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.480]   And you can't buy it anymore, but it's $30 a month.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.880]   And a limited data until like three gigabytes.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.680]   Five gigs and then it goes from 4G down to like 3G.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.600]   I mean, it's awesome.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600]   It's incredible.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.280]   And even though I had to pay out right, it was still cheaper, way cheaper than buying
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   on a contract.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:34.920]   Can I get you just a $10 patreon because the 40 unlimited right now is killing it unlimited
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.440]   minutes unlimited data up to 22 gigs unlimited.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.440]   Come on, baby.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.440]   It's 10 more dollars.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.440]   Let the pass go.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.440]   Let the pass go.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.800]   You you have me thinking you was on some Megatron tablet plan.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.680]   The Jesus plan that Leo got in the 80s like that $30.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.480]   You can't spend to come on man on T-Mobile.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480]   I'm on T-Mobile.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480]   $40 for everybody.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.040]   All taxes in dog.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.920]   You can spend 10 more dollars and call me.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.640]   That's why you never call me back because you only got 100 minutes.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.640]   See, that's ridiculous.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.120]   I need I need that extra $10 for the watch plan that I'm going to be getting.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.120]   So I can't.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.120]   Okay.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.120]   Okay.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.120]   Nice move went down.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.160]   You just say yourself and be a bad man.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.560]   I was just getting on you.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.360]   That was a good move right there.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   That's $10.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   Okay.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.360]   All right.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.120]   Let's move past hardware because we some of us are excited by the pixel, but nobody,
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.320]   nobody is excited by Google lawsuits.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:30.440]   And right now we know that Google is going to appeal a record lawsuit, a fine that was
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.200]   slapped on them on June 28th.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:38.000]   Now the EU slapped Google with a $2.7 billion fine for denying quote consumers a genuine
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.600]   choice, unquote, by using their search business to steer consumers away from competitors and
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.680]   to Google's controlled shopping platforms.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.440]   The EU Commission concluded that Google was giving its own shopping services priority
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.440]   placement.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.320]   If you, if you go to actually a Carson, there's a picture in that story, it shows you what
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.680]   a typical Google page will look like.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.840]   You've got your ads, but right above it, you look, you get something that doesn't look
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.640]   like an ad, but is actually Google's partners and Google shopping platform where they'll
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.840]   get a cut.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:14.960]   The fine could have been as much as 10% of Google's annual sales or $90 billion.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.400]   But instead they did the $2.7 billion fine.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.600]   The EU has set a September 28th deadline for stopping the practice.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.680]   So Google will no longer be able to prioritize their own ads, but Google has now filed an
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.760]   appeal and they were probably buoyed by a decision this past week for Intel.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:39.040]   Intel was able to force a reexamination of a $1.06 billion euro judgment against them
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.040]   for similar practices, for monopolistic practices.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:48.280]   Now we've had a long history of going back and forth with Google in Europe, be it with
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.440]   Spanish publishers or the right to be forgotten.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:58.440]   And now with this, this idea that they are using their market dominance to push a shopping
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:01.720]   platform that will get them even more sales.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.400]   Let's start with the lawsuit itself.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.160]   On its face, does it make sense to you?
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.840]   Google shopping sucks.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:14.400]   I was really annoyed when they changed it to like a pay for play model where they, it
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.320]   used to be a good aggregator of like you're looking for a product, here's all the retail
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.000]   as a carrier, here's the cheapest price.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.280]   Now retailers have to pay to get into it.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.360]   I mean, it's, it is not, it's not a good experience.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.800]   And finally, because the original ad model that Google copied was paid placement and
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.160]   search and Google said, no, no, no, no, no, we're above that.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.840]   And then they went and did that with shopping.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.640]   I also can't imagine they make much money at all with shopping.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.200]   I can't imagine they make $2.7 billion with the shopping stuff.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.200]   It's a bad service.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.200]   It's not there.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:48.080]   So that's what gives lie to me to the EU argument that this is a huge antitrust, the
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.840]   behemoth is coming in.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.400]   What with nothing?
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.360]   I think the clue there is a $2.7 billion fine.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:59.200]   It's deliberately, it's way lower than even what a normal fine would be of this magnitude
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.200]   because they realize the financial impact really wasn't there.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.600]   And if it, if it, if it does come to an appeal and Google actually does lay out their books
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.600]   and say, this is how much we made from it, they, they could make a good argument to say
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.600]   this is nowhere near a monopoly.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.360]   We may have better placement, but people are still buying from all the ads that we placed
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.360]   down below.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.560]   But does, but does that absolve them?
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:28.280]   If they say our strategy didn't work, does that mean that it wasn't a monopoly?
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.120]   I think yeah, by definition of it didn't work because I'm anopoly.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.120]   But this is just the beginning.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:37.520]   The Android probe could potentially be much, much bigger, which, which alleges that they
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.960]   prioritize their own services on Android phones over competitors with the result of consumer
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.400]   harm, which is something that they'll need to prove.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:53.600]   But Android is a, a, a significant revenue driver for Google and it's just a massive
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.920]   product that the world uses.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.520]   Well, the, the, the, the, that's going to be the part of their argument and, and you
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:04.000]   can't win because Google strategy was to give away an operating system to beat Apple.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.400]   And then now by giving, they're basically being accused of dumping.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   They're not.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.960]   They're giving us something for freeze.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.960]   Isn't that nice?
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.160]   Europe is behind the economic harm part is always the most difficult piece to prove because
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.800]   if your laws haven't caught up to the fact that we're making money by giving things away,
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.640]   that, that little tidbit is almost impossible to prove, especially through a court of appeals.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.560]   Oh, and what do you think is, is Google in the wrong here?
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.040]   Did, did they do a bad, bad thing or is this the EU overreacting?
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:40.080]   The EU has got a lot of issues and getting some free money would help those issues.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:46.160]   So that's why the, the, the fine is only 2.7 billion because no matter what happens, you
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.160]   can appeal.
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:50.760]   They're going to sell out of court for 1.2 billion and go on about their day and say,
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.480]   we're never going to do it again because we make no money from the first place.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.280]   The EU says, cool story, bro.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.760]   Let's go get private jets next week.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.360]   So I mean, it's neither here nor there as far as I'm concerned.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:06.240]   It's just, legalese people out there trying to get a free check because it's, it's wrong.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.280]   Yes, but they're not very good at it.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.240]   And Mark, I wasn't even going to say anything because you said exactly what I want to say.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.200]   Their experience sucks now.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.560]   So I mean, shame on them for even trying because it's just a horrible experience, which makes
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.760]   me care not for the whole issue.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.400]   Let me ask the panel, does anybody here actually buy stuff from a Google search?
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.560]   Because I always, I start with Amazon.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.560]   I type it in Amazon.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.840]   That's where I go.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.080]   If Amazon doesn't have it, Walmart does.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.600]   I don't, I can't remember the last time I actually bought something because Google had it in its
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.560]   little, as an ad or in the Google shopping platform.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:45.920]   I mean, on Google around to try to compare prices on more expensive items.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.080]   And then I go back to Amazon because I can get it the next day.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   I'm all over the wire cutter though.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.720]   I trust them immensely.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.480]   And you know, that's a, that's a really interesting business now too, because wire
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:02.720]   cutter, I brought together some people in commerce and media in New York and perched,
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.440]   you know, perch, P-U-R-C-H, right?
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.200]   They do, they do great, very focused things.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:12.360]   Gizmodo media, formerly known as Gawker, business insider, New York magazine, they're
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.080]   all going to commerce.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:18.160]   And commerce is interesting because what they said, these editorial people said is,
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.200]   you have to have trust there.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   If you're, if you're Gizmodo and you say you're going to have the best bargain out
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.920]   there, you don't find the best bargain.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.280]   You give people stuff, you're going to make more money on, people won't come to you.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:34.360]   So, so the idea of the kind of clickbait media model we were in, commerce actually
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.360]   might be, might help us a little bit.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.600]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.600]   All right.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.000]   How about a Google story that is going to make everyone a little uncomfortable?
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.440]   And that's the fact that Google is again being sued by its employees this time for pay discrimination
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.440]   against women.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:53.320]   Now, three women have sued Google for discriminating against female employees, specifically the
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.240]   suit hinges around so-called career tracks.
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:01.640]   Kelly Ellis, Ollie Pierce and Kelly Wissuri say that they were placed into lower tier
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.840]   tracks than they were eligible for.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.800]   Ellis was put in a level three track.
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.480]   That's where beginners start.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.000]   And she was put on front end development.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.320]   Now, the suit claims that in her case, there was a male colleague with the exact same amount
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.480]   of experience who was put in level four, which puts him on the back end team.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.120]   And the back end team is a much more prestigious spot.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.880]   It gets much more pay and it has more opportunities for advancement.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.200]   And it's almost exclusively male.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:33.680]   Wissuri was hired into level tool sales while a similar male candidate got level three,
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.600]   which also gave him commission.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:42.440]   Pierce had 10 years of experience going in, but was listed as managerial instead of technical,
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.200]   which limited her opportunities for advancement.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.000]   She was not a technical team.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.560]   All of the people that she was in charge of eventually passed her.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:56.720]   Now, this is always very, very iffy because of course we don't have any of the details,
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.920]   really, other than what it says in the lawsuit and other than the very limited information
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.640]   coming out of Google.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:07.240]   But right now, the attorney for the three women, James Feinberg, is trying to win class
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:12.720]   action status, which would cover all women at Google for the past four years.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.400]   And of course, whenever you're dealing with a class action, you're assuming that once
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.160]   it starts, the complaints are going to come flooding in because that's the only way that
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.120]   this is going to work.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:26.280]   Is this something that's actually going to work?
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.960]   Will this achieved class action status?
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.320]   Will you see sort of a stampede of women at Google saying, yeah, that's happening to
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.320]   me as well?
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.840]   Or is this an edge case?
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.240]   Well, it's definitely not an edge case.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:45.840]   If there is indeed paid discrimination and big paid discrepancies, that's national and
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.560]   global problem.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:54.640]   So I think if they were indeed discriminating against women, then good, the women should
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.880]   be able to get class action status and get that corrected.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   Right.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.360]   Now, those of us in the Valley who have friends who work for Google and other tech giants,
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.800]   I'll say, this is not the first time I've heard this.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.000]   I've heard this a lot.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.760]   And this is actually a way to get around some of the reporting information that Google has
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:18.080]   been doing to the Department of Labor, because you can say, well, we placed this person in
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.280]   a higher end job.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.800]   That's what suited him or him or her.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.840]   And so then you say, well, there's there's no paid discrimination because it's a different
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.200]   position.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.840]   What these women are saying is, wait a minute, we were placed in the wrong tracks.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.160]   We were deliberately placed in the wrong tracks.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:37.320]   They knew we were in the wrong tracks and they let us stay there because it would allow
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:43.560]   them to advance the men above us without it looking like it's blatant sexism.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.560]   Owen.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.560]   Sorry.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.160]   Big sigh.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:59.360]   As much as I love California for being like better than like most arrests of the country,
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:05.280]   that pocket that is San Francisco and is Silicon Valley is messed up.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:13.200]   It is a run by mostly white males and the systems that are put into place benefit those
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:20.640]   males first and males in general and people of color and women have tons of issues that
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.160]   are bigger and smaller than money.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:29.920]   And the bottom line is, I don't know for sure that there was discrimination, but I like
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:33.640]   the fact that there's a class that I just sued a foot so we can find out.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:37.720]   And if the pattern and the system seems to be laid out and then corresponding to make
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:42.640]   sure that these women could not advance and the way that they should, Google should be
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:43.640]   sued.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.440]   Facebook, any other large company with massive amounts of employees that might be doing
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.640]   something similar or something different should also be looked at because at some point it's
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.640]   got to stop.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:58.260]   And in that place in particular, there is so much money being thrown around and everybody
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:01.760]   pretends like they're better than they are and they're not.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.960]   Just because these companies rule the world, look like they're ruling the world, try to
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.440]   start ups here and there.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:16.280]   The problem again is the core process of these white males, not funding women founders.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.240]   From top to bottom is an issue.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:24.480]   So I will never side with a Google or anybody else over women or minorities.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.080]   And I love white men too, y'all, my bros on the panel.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.600]   I mean, just in general, I got to decide where everybody else first, especially in Silicon
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.800]   Valley because at some point it needs to get turned on this end and has stopped because
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:43.360]   Silicon Valley has this arrogance that is better than everybody, that they're doing something
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360]   special.
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:49.840]   And when it comes down to it, same systemic problems are boring out in the valley and is
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:54.960]   disgusting because everyone there acts like they're better when they're not and more men
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:59.080]   should stick behind these women and support them so that it's not just women in their
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.000]   class actions suit because some men are good men and no better.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.840]   So they need to work with them on that.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.640]   >> Glad we finally had an all male panel attack.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.000]   It's a very important gender issue.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   >> Exactly.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.920]   Hey, I watched with a lot of times and there's minority stuff and it's just a whole bunch
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.880]   of white guys and sometimes the white guys says the right thing.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880]   That's all that matters.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.600]   As long as somebody cares and is willing to help and do the right thing, that's what helps
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:28.880]   change because again, women can't just be out there doing it on their own because they
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.920]   need their male counterparts to support them as well.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:39.560]   >> This is a super sensitive topic just because there's no real way to win it.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:43.160]   You could present all the data, you could present all the anecdotal evidence that you
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:48.240]   have, but at some point people just have to say, gosh, I could see it on both sides.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.480]   I think there's actually something deeper though than just Silicon Valley.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.040]   There is, I don't know if it's an American thing.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:59.840]   I don't know if it's a technology world thing, but there is such a hesitancy to talk about
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.840]   our salaries.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.360]   We don't do it.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.480]   That's not polite conversation.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:09.640]   And you can't really talk about pay equality unless you're willing to talk about your pay.
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:13.760]   >> But again, it's not just the pay for the same job that's been the decision that's
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.760]   passed.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.120]   What this says is, you're putting me in a different rank.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.760]   So it's not the same job.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.480]   And you can justify the pay.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:26.160]   >> I agree with everything Owen said, and he said a bit other than I could have.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:31.560]   But there's clearly a problem across this country, didn't this election show us, with
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.600]   understanding diversity.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.680]   And there's clearly a problem in Silicon Valley with diversity.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.200]   And Silicon Valley actually knows it.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.240]   They just haven't figured out what to do about it, I think.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.800]   And being forced into this position will probably in the end be a good thing, because the more
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.280]   diversity there is at every rank of the company, the better the products and services are going
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.280]   to be.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:58.160]   The more they're going to be serving larger markets.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.840]   And it's good business.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.680]   It's like, don't be evil, be good.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.080]   This is part of being good.
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:09.600]   >> And that's, for the longest time, that's been the idea that we ask you to be socially
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.760]   responsible because it's good business.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.440]   You hire the right people and you treat them right and you get better people.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.120]   You act properly when you sell products and you'll get a better, more loyal customer
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.120]   base.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.600]   Unfortunately, I don't know if that always plays out properly.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600]   It's not.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:28.040]   A lot of companies that don't play by the rules that aren't being fair, that aren't being
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.720]   ethical, will get ahead.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.720]   They will get a leg up.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:33.840]   And so the other companies will say, hey, well, why should we follow the rules if they're
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.840]   not?
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:35.840]   >> Well, you can be Uber for a while.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   >> Yes.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   >> But not forever.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   >> Yes.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840]   Actually, wow, I love that.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:40.920]   That should be the show title.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.680]   You can be Uber for a while.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.840]   >> All right.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.840]   >> Can we--
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.840]   >> I'm sorry.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.840]   >> Go ahead.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   >> What's your next story?
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.840]   Where are you looking at?
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.480]   I'm looking at this list and it's not what I wanted to go.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.000]   >> What do you want?
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   >> What do you want?
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.360]   >> I'm always in the notes.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.600]   I know about the ads and I know about the money we are here doing it.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.000]   But I want to get to these two ex-Googlers.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   >> Oh, yes.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   >> Oh, yes.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   >> The Brodega.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.840]   >> Yeah, we're killing the time right now.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:08.840]   We're flowing.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.080]   So I want to make sure I get that in before he jumps to his other story.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.000]   We can jump into an ad too now if you like.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000]   >> No, no, no.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.680]   Oh, and take us to Brodega Town because this burned down the internet for a couple of
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:19.680]   years.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.640]   >> Yeah, of course we're talking about the two ex-Googlers who decided that they are
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.840]   going to innovate by removing all your Brodegas.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.880]   Now if you don't live in an area that has a lot of Brodegas and maybe you don't understand
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.480]   the story, but think of it as a lifeline.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.640]   It is the place where you can go down to the corner and get anything you need from--
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:38.000]   >> You can get your egg and cheese on a roll.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   >> Exactly.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.200]   And these Googlers say, you know what would make that Brodega experience even better?
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.560]   This experience of reaching out to your neighbor and seeing people and interacting.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.360]   What if we made it completely impersonal by replacing them with robots?
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.920]   That, my friends, are the Brodegas.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.600]   Now Owen, obviously you have some strong sentiments on this?
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:04.760]   >> Okay, so first of all, again, two white guys, ex-Googlers, it's always cool when you
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.120]   get to put ex-Googler in front of something that's supposed to make me think that you're
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.280]   the smartest person in the world.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.960]   I mean, hundreds of thousands of people have come and gone to Google, but Lord knows these
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.360]   ex-Googlers in their startups.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.240]   I mean, let's just have it subbessie, turn over the world for them.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:25.200]   Second of all, so you take a vending machine and tell the world that you're going to kill
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.840]   mom and pop shops and Brodegas.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.640]   And then you call your company-- you're going to get free money right now.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.120]   Brodega, if you all listen to it, call me.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.120]   No, call me.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:35.120]   Just listen, it's free.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.800]   So you want to call your company, Brodega, instead of calling it vendor and spell it,
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.080]   we're like every other normal tech person that's looked on thousands.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.520]   You call it Brodega.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.520]   So you--
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.520]   You know what else--
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.520]   What else?
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.520]   The mascot?
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.520]   You saw that?
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:50.520]   The Brodega cacked.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:55.840]   Listen, listen, if you put a Brodega vending machine in New York City, you would literally
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.200]   have a fight on your hand.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:01.720]   Someone would take that thing off the truck and then some guy named Julio and Juan would
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:05.560]   beat you up and make you put it back on the truck because you're messing with the family
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560]   business.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:11.000]   Secondly, if you were smart, besides not calling it Brodega and using appropriation and just
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.240]   stealing and then lying and telling the people that you have someone do a survey, whatever
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:19.920]   company that you had to a survey for you, you should sue them because they lied to you.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.640]   And I don't think you had a company do a survey in the first place.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.680]   But literally, if you just want to say, hey, we know that people are busy and their company
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.680]   is like that.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.760]   So we want to bring the Brodega experience to their company because, you know, when I
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.960]   leave Facebook at night and I got to go home and do laundry for my kids, it'd be nice
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:36.240]   if I could go to a vendor machine and get some tide detergent out instead of going to
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.240]   the local grocery store.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.120]   And I'm just trying to help out people like that or better yet.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.480]   I'm going to put it outside of mom pop shot that maybe does do 24 hours and work with
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.360]   them because you know we're going to have logistic problems putting all this stuff in
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.360]   a vendor machine.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.560]   So maybe we can help them out and pop shots and we're going to kill them and destroy them
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.960]   and take them out into the backyard.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:56.760]   Like who are these people and who gives these people money for these stupid ideas?
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:01.280]   And then you spend all this money on PR and all boy did you get your PR because I'm thinking,
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:05.400]   wait, this is like a post mates is like a steal because post mates comes and brings me
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:08.400]   what I want when I just make a phone call and do on my app.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:11.520]   They just bring it to me, but you're going to put a box that I'm supposed to just not
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:15.200]   rob it through glass and then how you feel it?
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.280]   Like what are you doing?
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.920]   Who are these people?
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.720]   X Googlers my fault.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.680]   There's a reason to.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.520]   We need to take a pause for a cigarette break.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:29.320]   Do my brain hurt so bad with stuff like this is so stupid.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:34.400]   I'm about to start a comment that says run it bias and just be like, look, just call
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.320]   me and just give me your pitch.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.920]   I mean, I told you like five grand.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.080]   I give you hour and tell you what's wrong.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.760]   Maybe I call a black friend, a Latina, friend, a gay friend, somebody outside of your bubble
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:49.720]   because these people are just being so smart and so dumb, so dumb.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.760]   And then they surround themselves with guesmen and that.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.120]   I don't know what water's going on up in there, but there's some water problems.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.960]   There's something that water out there in San Francisco because it's bro country, bro.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:03.120]   It's every building you go in out here says that it's built on toxic waste.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.120]   That's right.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   It's killing everybody's brain.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.520]   The smartest, dumb people in the world out there sometimes.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.520]   Whoo.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:14.880]   Bro, I think the most interesting thing about that story was the fact that those two ex-gouglers,
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:17.080]   they were really caught by surprise at the backlash.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.080]   They did not expect.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.080]   As were the investors.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.360]   They were like, oh, so you don't want us to kill the stores that you've had for a hundred
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.360]   years?
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.080]   Oh, the dude from Capitol, whatever, finally going out there tweeting, we've got a van.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.680]   We got a boot digging and our office.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.680]   Everybody loves it.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.680]   Cool.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:37.440]   They're putting toilet paper from the glass machine on their way out the door.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:40.280]   Of course they do because you gave them money.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:43.640]   You doofus and then you're going to go on Twitter and tweet that dumb stuff.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:47.400]   Like I said, I wish they would take one of these bodegas to New York City.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:48.400]   Whoo.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.560]   I'd pay money to sit front row to watch it come off a truck.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.800]   So here's a question for you.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.800]   Here's a question.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.040]   Here's what you said.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:59.960]   If they had just called it vending two dot O without an E right?
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.920]   If they just said, you know that vending machine, you have to kick because the thing gets stuck
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.640]   and we're going to make it better of any machine.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:05.640]   It's going to be on shelves.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.040]   You're going to take it out and it's going to be okay.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.760]   And your office, your office vending machine will now be this.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.400]   Would that have been up with that?
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.440]   They could maybe had a business there.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.440]   That was to donuts.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:17.800]   That's how you make money.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:24.400]   You put it in high end offices or high end apartments, hotels that don't have a kind
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:27.080]   of vending machine and then that would have made you money.
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:30.920]   That would have gave you some footing to start to grow the business because right now, like
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:33.400]   I said, take that thing off a truck and see if y'all last.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.400]   That company is.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:40.480]   And in New York, what's already dead is the office newsstand.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.080]   Every big building used to have a newsstand where you go down, you get a snapple and you
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.360]   could look at the magazines and not buy them and all that and they are dead.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.880]   There is no such thing in New York anymore, nothing.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:56.840]   And so if you want to go out and get your Doritos, you got to go and you're in the office,
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.680]   not in a neighborhood where there's a Bodega who knows the residents.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.000]   If you're in a horrible office park, there's nowhere you can go.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000]   They could have had a business here.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.560]   I think it's still, you're right.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.360]   It's dumb to say there's this thing with glass and shelves and it's surely it's not going
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.560]   to work and people are going to figure out how to rip it off, but that's their problem.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:12.560]   Exactly.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.560]   I'm not.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:14.560]   I don't know.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.560]   That made me so bad.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:21.160]   Now, Bodega, if you're listening, you may want to contract with Owen J.J. Stone because
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.720]   he's got a way for you to pivot your business to something that's not going to outrage the
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.800]   Internet or at least save yourself from making it bloody fool yourself.
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:28.800]   There you go.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:34.680]   Now, when we come back, I would actually like to go a little bit over the interesting story
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:40.280]   forming in the heartland of America that centers around jobs, technologies, factories
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.280]   and Amazon.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.280]   Can we do that?
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.280]   All right.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:44.280]   Well, we'll do that.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.520]   But first, let's take another break and toss over to Uncle Leo who has these words from
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.920]   a sponsor of Twit.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.520]   Yes, I'm back to interrupt.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:56.400]   Sorry, but I got to work as they say and now we're here for my sponsor.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.640]   I don't know how many of you have installed the wing, wing video doorbell yet is wonderful.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.640]   It's awesome.
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.760]   I love my ring video doorbell.
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:08.440]   It's funny because now as I walk around my neighborhood, I see more and more of them.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:13.320]   And maybe that's because of rings neighborhood program where you can effectively use your
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.320]   ring video doorbell.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.320]   That's the doorbell.
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:19.680]   It's got a camera, speaker, microphone, motion sensors, connects to the Internet, lets you
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:23.760]   know wherever you are, who's at your door, who's walking by.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.720]   Because of that, you get a few of those in your neighborhood.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.320]   You've got a neighborhood watch, a digital neighborhood watch.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.160]   And you can actually with your permission, you can give others access to your camera
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.360]   and you can see what's going on.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.800]   You could protect your neighborhood as well as your own home.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:41.120]   I ring is just, they did this by the way in Wilshire Park, which is suburb of LA.
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:45.040]   And it was interesting because they only gave out, they gave one in 10 houses a ring video
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.040]   doorbell.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.320]   They didn't give everybody one, just 10%.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.600]   But they saw a reduction in crime over six months of more than 50%.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.880]   And I have to think it's just, you know, thieves know, well, we can't go to that neighborhood.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.520]   They've got video doorbells everywhere.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.520]   You're going to love it.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.520]   Easy to install.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:05.960]   There are a variety of ring video doorbells depending on your needs.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.360]   One has a battery so you don't even have to have a wired doorbell.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:11.400]   You could put it on a front gate, put it on a guest house.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:15.480]   If you have an Airbnb or you rent your stuff out, what a great way to keep an eye on your
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:16.480]   Airbnb.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:21.040]   And of course it integrates with all of your favorite smart locks and hubs and so forth
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.720]   and modern security.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.440]   And even I can use it with my Amazon Echo.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:30.120]   I could say Echo, show me my front door anywhere in the world.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.120]   I'm on it right now.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.520]   As we do this, I'm on a riverboat in France.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.920]   I can actually take out my phone and see who's at my front door.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:35.920]   I can answer it.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.040]   I could say, yeah, I'm in the bath right now.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.040]   Please leave that package.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:42.440]   I can keep an eye on the package too.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.960]   Home security begins at the front door, but it doesn't end there.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.320]   That's why they've extended their product line to include the ring floodlight camera.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:54.360]   When somebody walks down behind your house, the lights come on, you get a notification.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.360]   You see the movement.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.360]   You can look at the camera.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.360]   You can talk to them.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.240]   Hey, what are you doing there?
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:02.200]   Believe me, that scares the pants off a bag.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.600]   I, or dear, it works with dear to, hey, dear, get away from my bushes.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.520]   And you can hear them.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.960]   And if it does not scare them, you could push a button on your phone.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.920]   I don't care if you're in France or anywhere in the world.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.000]   You can push a button on your phone and a 110 decibel alarm goes off.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.520]   Believe me, even dear, that'll scare the heck out of them.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.520]   They're gone.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.600]   Wall Street Journal's best of CES this year, 2017.
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:32.200]   The ring video doorbell, the ring, floodlight cam, we've actually got a great deal for you.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:37.400]   A hundred, up to $150 off on a Ring of Security kit when you go to ring.com/twit.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:41.200]   R-I-N-G, ring, ding, ding, ding, ding, ring.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:45.840]   .com/twit.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.840]   I use it.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:47.840]   I love it.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.640]   Many of the panelists use it.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.320]   Jamie Zimmer is a Zimmerseman off.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.960]   This guy is such a great guy.
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:55.960]   I love him.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.840]   He was up, maybe you saw him on Shark Tank with a previous product.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.520]   When he came up with a ring, it clicked.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.520]   It clicked.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.760]   And it is now, I'm sure of it, the best-selling home security device out there.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:09.360]   It is the king of I-O-T devices.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.400]   Ring.com/twit.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.920]   Try it today.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.920]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.320]   All right, let's go ahead and take a trip over to Cheeseline.
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:25.320]   I've actually lived in the state, Wisconsin, Wisconsin three days ago in a '64 to '31
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.000]   vote, approved an incentive package to lure Foxconn into the state.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.600]   Of course, Foxconn is the famous manufacturer of so many of your favorite pieces of gear
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.960]   from phones to networking units.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.200]   Now, they will be investing $10 billion to build a factory.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:47.020]   And for that investment, over the course of 15 years, Foxconn will get $2.85 billion in
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.400]   tax incentives from the state of Wisconsin.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:53.960]   Now, the factory will build everything from TVs, again, to networking devices.
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:59.760]   It will initially employ 3,000 workers who are expected to make about $54,000 a year
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.760]   plus benefits.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:06.760]   It could, could potentially employ up to 13,000 workers in the future.
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:09.360]   The finances are a little interesting.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.960]   This is where the story kind of goes south.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.440]   The legislative fiscal bureau, it's a nonpartisan financial watchdog.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:21.880]   They calculated that assuming that Foxconn hires all 13,000, not 3,000, but 13,000 workers,
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.960]   and assuming that you have an additional 22,000 jobs created by suppliers wanting to come
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:33.920]   into the area, that in that best case scenario, you will start to get a return on the investment
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.120]   in 25 years.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:38.800]   So that part doesn't sound super, super great.
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.040]   When people are jumping on that, however, I think this is actually part of a much bigger
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.040]   bet.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.520]   This is not just a gamble on Foxconn.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:49.560]   Wisconsin wants this to be the new Silicon Valley.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.560]   In fact, who doesn't want to be the new Silicon Valley?
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.560]   Right, because it's money.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:56.680]   But at the announcement, when they announced this vote and that the bill was going to be
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:02.040]   signed, they specifically called out Amazon and they said, "We're going to be the new
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.120]   destination for tech.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:08.640]   Amazon and their 50,000 jobs would be more than welcome and we'll give them a premium
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.960]   place in the new Silicon Valley."
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.800]   They already gave away their tax break.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.080]   Amazon's not going to go there if they don't get $5 billion.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.320]   Right, right.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:20.640]   And we've actually seen this a lot.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.480]   We saw a new Silicon Valley in New York.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:25.920]   We saw a new Silicon Valley in Illinois.
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.160]   We saw one in Israel.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.240]   We saw one in India.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.240]   We saw one in London.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.240]   Berlin.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.240]   London.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:34.080]   Everyone's trying to recreate the Silicon Valley and they all have the same strategy,
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:38.640]   which is we'll give you a lot of tax breaks so that you come in and then you'll stay.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   It's not how it works.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.400]   They come in, then the tax breaks stop and then they leave because someone else is willing
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.040]   to give them a bigger tax break.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.000]   Which also means that within the nation, we're competing with each other.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.560]   Right, of course, of course, because we all want it in our state.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.440]   But my question to you is, is this a bet?
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:02.600]   Is this actually a bet or is this destined to fail?
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.600]   The latter.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.200]   I think these aren't these always destined to fail?
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.880]   I really want this to work.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.960]   I mean, it's kind of bold.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.920]   Again, they know it doesn't make financial sense.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:16.160]   To get an ROI in 25 years, you're basically writing it off.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:18.960]   So they need other businesses to come in.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:19.960]   I just don't see that.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.960]   I guess that's how that is.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:23.280]   But how can they really make themselves cool?
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:25.280]   It's Wisconsin.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:26.280]   Love it.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.280]   Love it.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:28.280]   Jesus, great.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.560]   No, again, the short story, sure you gave somebody a couple of jobs.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.160]   First thing is the weather.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.960]   You're never going to be Silicon Valley and the story, the weather.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:45.000]   Second of all, just to get their return in 25 years, they'll be gone before that 25
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.440]   years even came back around.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:50.640]   And whenever I hear possibility of up to 3,000 jobs, this is one of the core things that I
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.280]   dislike about America.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:42:01.040]   Rich people who are ungodly rich, pardon me, use the word, but are just so rich, they can
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.760]   afford to do anything.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.840]   They don't want and demand things to be free.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:12.320]   The fact that we as taxpayers allow football owners to come in and have the taxpayers pay
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.160]   for their savings.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.240]   And I'm sitting there thinking to myself, so as a taxpayer, when do I get my free ticket?
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:22.120]   I feel like if you come in and add the taxpayers pay, every single man, woman, and child in
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.760]   that region is going to take it to one game.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.960]   I don't care if it takes you 20 years to get them to one game.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:29.840]   They should be able to take their family and go to a game because they're the ones
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.280]   paying for it on their backs.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:38.680]   So to get Amazon or Foxconn or Ramicon to come here, I got to give you $3 billion, take money
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.640]   out of people's pockets in Wisconsin who there are 3,000 people who are already not having
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.640]   a job.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.840]   Imagine there are 13,000 people who still don't have a job and you're pre taking away money
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:49.800]   from people that might never get that money back.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:53.840]   But that's the way the system works because we have lobbyists and group of outtiges in
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.120]   the way the world works and technology.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:01.240]   So no sir, sadly for you, the dream of this working only works for the rich.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:04.040]   Because that's the way the cookie crumbles.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:06.920]   The game is rigged and I can't stand it.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:12.280]   Now I'm absolutely with you on this being put onto the backs of the people who really
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:14.600]   can't afford this kind of attacks incentive.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.000]   However, I'm not willing to go as far as saying it's corrupt.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   It looks corrupt.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.800]   It will look stupid.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:25.480]   But, I mean, if you ever lived in Wisconsin, that state's hurting.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.240]   I mean, there's a reason why we've got an outswell of very strange conversations and
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.520]   this is part of it.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:36.240]   When you have people who are so far down, this sounds like, okay, well, we have to do
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.240]   something.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.360]   So again, you also want to go from the demands.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.240]   Not just from the, from, let's give a tax break and force them to come in here.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:51.360]   If instead you really change your schools, you had tremendous talent base there and people
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.240]   wanted to go in there, then that would make a difference.
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:01.280]   The other story is that the rundown is Amazon, of course, is looking for its HQ2.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.040]   Every city is now talking about this.
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.160]   I'm going to make a pitch right now because I live near it.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.440]   I want this to go to Newark, New Jersey.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440]   And here's why.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.600]   Audible is already headquartered there.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.080]   Audible knows the city.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.080]   It's next to an airport.
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.680]   It's next to the center of the universe, otherwise known as New York, New York.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.640]   It's next to a lot of things, but it could make a difference.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:27.040]   It could make a huge difference in that city as it starts to come up and it needs business.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.280]   And 50,000 jobs can make a big difference.
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:32.600]   So the part of the question is, does Amazon go to just where they get the best deal or
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.400]   where they could make the most difference?
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:39.040]   Well, if they're responsible, then they go to where they can make the biggest difference.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.680]   Because it's going to have a value in the long run.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.080]   But I don't know where it's going to come.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.600]   Did, did Mark Zuckerberg give an imaginary hundred billion dollars to like Newark?
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:49.600]   No, it was.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.360]   It was not imaginary, but the benefit unfortunately was.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.760]   Because I live in Jersey and I just remembered it not doing anything, but they ended up on
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.080]   Oprah and Cory Booker became a national name and all the hoop.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.560]   Again, it's just don't ask me these questions.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:04.960]   I just, because it's all just so much fluff and crap.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.200]   And when you actually look at it, you know what's going on.
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.200]   It's ridiculous.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:11.640]   I'm like, man, I would love to be on the social media team one day when Cory Booker tries
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.920]   to remember something because Mark Zuckerberg came down and had a hood up a check and said
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.720]   stock up to whatever.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:20.280]   And then they got a couple books and I've been through Newark and Newark is still not a
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.440]   cool place to be.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.880]   Good luck on you, Audible.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.600]   Imagine they're Amazon ain't going to Newark because they can't supply their employees
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.800]   with enough vests to protect themselves.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:34.280]   So there's another development in the story, which is if you look at the actual contract,
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:41.320]   you look at the numbers, Foxconn will get the full tax incentive in 15 years.
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:44.280]   The ROI doesn't hit until 25.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.240]   So can you guess what's going to happen in 15 years?
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.280]   It's probably and they're looking at this going.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:53.400]   Foxconn is right now doing a lot of investment into robotics.
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:56.320]   Let's say let's even say Foxconn says, no, no, no, no, we're going to stick around as
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.320]   long as we're here.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.040]   The stuff they make can all disappear.
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:02.800]   We get implanted bio chips and Foxconn does is out of business.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.520]   And there's also the fact that there's a reason why a lot of factories are moving out of
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.520]   the United States.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:08.520]   We don't like them.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.960]   Factories destroy the community in which you live.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:15.560]   Why do you think that we move from everything was made in Taiwan, that everything was made
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.040]   in India, now everything is made in China?
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:21.800]   And even then they're starting to say, this is not worth the ecological disaster that
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.760]   we are facing.
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.240]   At some point, the pain becomes so, so much that you say, we're willing to outsource this.
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.840]   We're willing to lose 3,000 jobs if it means that our state doesn't turn into a toxic waste
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.840]   dump.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.000]   Oh, humanity.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.840]   Show title.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:44.280]   If we really wanted to do something that was, this is not social justice warrior, but if
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:48.120]   we wanted to do something to wake people up, we would go to a city like Los Angeles and
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.160]   say, hey, you guys buy a lot of iPhones.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.240]   We're putting an iPhone factory in Los Angeles, but we don't see that.
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:55.960]   It's always, it's one removed.
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.160]   It's not in my backyard.
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:01.480]   I get this wonderful device and all the bad stuff goes to another part of the world or
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:03.720]   in this particular case, another part of the country.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:06.520]   I don't see that changing anytime in the near future.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.120]   By all accounts, Foxconn is not exactly a great place to work, by the way.
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.320]   No, I mean, $54,000 plus benefits.
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:17.360]   That's tempting to a lot of suicide.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.440]   When you're hurting, yes, it sounds great.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.440]   It does.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.920]   Even though the chance that you're one of the 3,000 that's going to get that $54,000
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:24.920]   a lot, that's not a great.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:28.600]   Not a two mile line long, long line to get the jobs.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.600]   Foxconn.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.040]   A great name.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.040]   Con.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.040]   Con.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.040]   Con.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.280]   All right, let's move a little bit to something fun and theoretical.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.800]   Oh, cryptocurrency.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.480]   We all love Bitcoins, yeah?
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.480]   Yeah.
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.480]   Right.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.480]   Oh, wow, we've got Bitcoin.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.880]   Oh, wait, Gemraby, you actually have a Bitcoin or you have what?
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:57.360]   I also have one Bitcoin, so I was worth $5,000 12 days ago, then I was worth $2,900 yesterday.
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:58.360]   Whoa.
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:00.120]   And now I think I'm up to $3,700 today.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:01.840]   So it fluctuates a lot.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:02.840]   We've known this.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.520]   Bitcoin is pretty volatile.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.440]   In fact, it's that volatility that makes it an interesting investment for a lot of people.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:14.520]   But recently, there's been a very strong downward tug on the blockchain because China
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.480]   has decided they're not going to have exchanges anymore.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.240]   They will just not allow it.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.080]   Their thinking is that they have startups that are using cryptocurrency, specifically
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:27.400]   Bitcoin, to fund their ventures.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:31.000]   And the spec that of the highly speculative nature of this means that if they have enough
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:37.120]   of those businesses, then a bad day of Bitcoin could wipe out an entire sector.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.120]   And they've said no more.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.720]   So as of the end of September, they don't allow them.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.440]   All Bitcoin exchanges will shut down or wipe out a lot of people's fortunes.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.920]   China has had a problem with this for a long time where there is this sort of cult of the
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:58.720]   IPO because there was an era in China where you buy shares in an IPO and you suddenly
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.640]   have like a lot more money.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.920]   And so like very uneducated people, the middle class, were like spending money on IPOs and
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.200]   then that whole market kind of like collapsed upon itself.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.200]   And a lot of people lost money.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:16.840]   And Icos are starting to look similar.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.040]   You put money into it.
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.040]   It's like, wow, all these other people are putting money into it.
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:22.480]   It is a huge fortune.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:24.200]   So many of them look so sketch.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.680]   I've received announcements for Icos probably at least one or two per week for the last
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:31.400]   two months.
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:35.280]   And they all have the same pitch, the next big thing in cryptocurrency.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:39.720]   And we've got this person and this piece of talent and they don't explain why they're
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.520]   going to be the new cryptocurrency standard.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:44.280]   They just all assume that, oh, yeah, you're going to think this is Bitcoin there for you
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.280]   buy in.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:47.400]   This is going to sound off topic, but I promise it's not.
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:51.280]   I'm watching this amazing series right now on Amazon trapped.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.280]   That is Icelandic.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.080]   That is to say the language is Icelandic, right?
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.080]   And it's a large cast.
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:01.960]   I figure it's about 10% of the entire population of Iceland is in the show.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:04.960]   But the great scene I just watched today is there's somebody coming in.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:06.480]   They're going to put a harbor in here.
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.480]   We got everybody.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.480]   Chinese, Chinese, America is over.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:10.880]   They say China is where it's at.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.640]   And there's one old fisherman koot there that says we went through this already.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.080]   And we learn.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:19.760]   And there's the crash in Iceland, right?
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:21.560]   And the crash hit this country.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:22.560]   And we never learned.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.560]   We never learned.
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:24.960]   Well, China just had this.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:27.640]   They just got over a major real estate crash.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:30.280]   They had all of these apartments and office buildings that were going up because they
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:35.160]   assumed that you were going to continue growing at this incredible pace with a speculative
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.800]   market and it destroyed wealth.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:42.040]   Hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth wiped out literally overnight in some cases.
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:43.880]   So they're doing it again.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.880]   It's exact same thing.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:46.800]   You're going to make a lot of millionaires and billionaires.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:49.680]   And then you're going to break a lot of millionaires and billionaires.
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:54.160]   In this particular case, though, China is saying unlike the real estate crash where there
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:57.440]   was something left, there was a corpse you could pick over.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:00.960]   When you have a cryptocurrency crash, there's nothing.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:01.960]   It's just gone.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:02.960]   It's into the ether.
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:08.880]   The other side of it is China has a relatively controlled currency.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:15.720]   And Bitcoin allows people to exchange money in a way that's not always apparent to the
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.240]   government where it's going.
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:21.840]   And so Bitcoin has obviously had a lot of money laundering claims or an ad for a while.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:27.320]   But within China, it's also people can just use it to buy other currencies that they otherwise
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.360]   wouldn't be able to buy into.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:32.680]   That's what surprised me about Bitcoin being allowed in and the exchanges being allowed
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:33.920]   in in the first place.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.720]   I thought China would be one of the last places that would allow it because, specifically
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.880]   because of that.
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:43.880]   You can't control your currency if you have this wild card currency running rampant in
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:49.360]   not even in the back valleys, in the streets, in your vision of Wall Street.
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:54.160]   We've seen $60 million of cryptocurrency wealth wiped out in the last week because of the
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.680]   fluctuation.
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:01.040]   We know that China has one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges right now, but their volume
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:05.720]   has been decreasing since January because that's when China mandated fees.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:09.560]   It used to be it was free to exchange Bitcoin for other currencies in China.
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:11.960]   They mandated a fee to bring it on par with the rest of the world.
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.480]   So it's down to about 10%.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:19.880]   A lot of the Bitcoin aficionados are saying it's not that much, the exchanges will pick
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:22.520]   up elsewhere, which I'm sure they will.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.440]   But do you see this?
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.440]   Let's get speculative right now.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:30.000]   Do you see this action being repeated across multiple countries as they start to look at
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.880]   this at China specifically and their answer to stopping a speculative market that could
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.880]   destroy their economy?
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:40.680]   Is this going to be repeated again and again and again?
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:48.080]   China is China and other countries are not China.
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:51.160]   So just think of it this way.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:55.760]   China has a mom and dad and they control your piggy bank and they control what, how much
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.720]   TV you watch, they control how much internet you watch, they control what you learn.
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:05.840]   America has an infant leader who says, do what you like, have fun, burn it all down, build
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:06.840]   it all up, whatever.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:11.920]   The rest of the world kind of goes on that model, so no, I don't see it going that way.
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:18.320]   But again, with all the Bitcoin stuff, you know, Fool me once, shame on me, Fool me twice,
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:19.320]   I forget Bush could do it.
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:20.320]   What a president of Bush say.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:23.760]   Fool me once, shame on you, Fool me twice.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:25.760]   I can't just fool the new goal.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:30.400]   I can't remember what he says, but China is one of the only countries that could do this.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:33.480]   Everybody else is not going to follow China's lead with this.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.040]   I don't see how they could.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:38.200]   I don't think the US is going to ban Bitcoin.
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:45.240]   But the SEC has talked about ICAAs in particular and has warned about, you know, potential
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.960]   pumping dump schemes and...
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:48.760]   Well, there's no regulation whatsoever.
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.520]   They're not considered financial institutions.
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.680]   This is Florida.
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:59.320]   So I can see the SEC more closely scrutinizing ICAAs and shutting down some of those businesses.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:04.760]   I had a relative who lives in Florida and has retired contact me about an ICAW that she
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:06.080]   thinks might be a good investment.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.040]   And I was like, "No, stop.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:09.040]   Stop."
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:14.000]   But so-and-so down the road, they invested and they tripled their money in 24 hours.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000]   Like, okay.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000]   Okay.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000]   But I think it's true.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000]   Wow.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]   Don't look up Ponzi.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000]   Exactly.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:26.720]   I mean, the thing is that same story happens with real estate from Uncle Johnny buying a
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:28.760]   car from Willie down the block.
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:33.200]   Like, I mean, it's cool that it's Bitcoin and it's like imaginary money.
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:37.480]   This is also, remember that, also, like when your person puts in their money, yes, it's
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.520]   real money, but there's also a lot of, "I was rich yesterday."
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.160]   Well, you only put in $100.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:43.560]   But it was up to three.
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:45.200]   You never had $3,000, bro.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:48.320]   Like, if you thought you had $3,000, you should have cashed out instead of trying to
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.200]   live this dream that you thought was going to happen.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.280]   So there's always scammers.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.400]   There's always scams.
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:54.920]   This is just another form of it.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:58.680]   And hey, maybe you get rich and go live the dream like Uncle Leo won a yacht somewhere
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:54:59.680]   in France.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:01.400]   I don't know.
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.640]   When we come back, we do, I do want to cover just a tiny bit more.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:11.200]   Did you know that you could automatically sue to potentially get $25,000?
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:14.880]   We're going to bring you all the Equifax news because we got to do it.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:15.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:16.880]   I'll scan.
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:17.880]   It is an Ico-style scan.
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.400]   We got an ultimate Ponzi scheme, but it's actually a real deal.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.400]   We'll get to that.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.200]   But first, if you haven't been watching Twit this last week, this is what you missed.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.200]   Previously on Twit.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:34.400]   Remember when I started to install Windows 10s on this computer?
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:36.520]   All it'll do now is that.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:37.520]   OK.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.040]   I got to go.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:40.040]   Bye.
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.680]   No, I would know.
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:42.680]   Know how.
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:43.680]   Today on Know How?
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.680]   Protecting your credits.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:46.680]   Getting smarter with your finances.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.960]   Today, what we wanted to do is to give people actual, actionable information that they could
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:54.600]   take and they could use to protect themselves.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.160]   The new screen savers.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.680]   We talked about preparing for disasters.
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:55:59.680]   This is a tool.
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:00.680]   It's a tool.
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.680]   Just like a rock.
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:05.640]   I thought what we could possibly do is go through some of our go bags and some of our
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.200]   philosophies of putting together disaster preparedness kits.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.760]   The whole idea is I need something that can keep me alive.
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:15.600]   You've told me that I shouldn't be carrying this.
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.760]   I've always included a pry bar, a crowbar in every bug out bag.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:26.560]   Just make sure you're not going to end up in prison because yeah, actually crowbars
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:28.680]   are really effective in self defense.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:29.680]   Quit.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.080]   Don't make me come back there.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:36.200]   I had to say that episode with Patrick Dorn was a lot of fun.
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.520]   But also that MRE tasted a lot better than I thought it would.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:40.520]   So what did you have?
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:46.680]   I had a Mexican stew, chicken stew-ish stuff.
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:49.720]   I mean, it was ridiculously salty because it has to be.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:52.240]   But it lasts up to six years in the storage.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:53.240]   That's not bad.
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.240]   Right?
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.240]   I mean, you do that.
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:59.080]   You're going to become a disaster guy.
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.080]   Oh, a prepper?
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.080]   Yeah, a prepper.
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.240]   But I do like to have at least a bug out bag.
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:06.080]   Oh, and do you have a bug out bag?
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.080]   He's bugging out.
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:08.240]   Oh, he's bugging out.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.240]   He's--
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:15.520]   We were just wondering if you had a bug out bag going.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.880]   I do have a bug out bag.
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:18.880]   What's in it?
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:21.720]   Is it like a three day supply to get out of the country or is it just to get back to
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:22.720]   your house?
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:24.200]   I'm running through the bathroom real quick too.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:27.720]   The coolest thing that I have in a bug out bag is Newport cigarettes.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.400]   Two cases, vacuum sealed.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.320]   I swap them out every six months.
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:33.040]   Is that your Bitcoin?
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:35.840]   Oh, Dev, you know what people do for a cigarette?
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:36.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:38.680]   The apocalypse comes, bro.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:40.640]   I can get a lot of stuff for a pack of smokes.
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:41.640]   You have no idea.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:42.640]   You're right back.
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:43.640]   There we go.
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:44.640]   It's a whole new business.
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.640]   Bitcoin, you can smoke.
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:46.640]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:47.640]   Bitcoin, you get addicted to.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:53.560]   On that note, let's go ahead and jump to one more sponsor of this episode of Twitter.
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:55.160]   Man, this show goes fast.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:59.800]   Sorry to interrupt one more time, but I got to tell you about WordPress.
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:00.800]   That's where my blog is.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.800]   In fact, if you want to see pictures of my trip, I'm blogging it where I will be.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:05.280]   I probably haven't got anything up yet.
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:06.760]   I'm a little slow.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:10.320]   At leoleport.com, I'm so glad to be back on WordPress.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.360]   I know I've flirted with some other guys for a while, but I've been using a WordPress
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:17.000]   site since the early 2000s.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:22.240]   I self-hosted it for a while, ran it myself, but now I'm on WordPress.com and I love it
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.320]   because I don't spend any time updating it, making patches.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:31.080]   I get all the plugins I want and I've got a great site with that easy to use WordPress
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:36.840]   interface because WordPress runs 28% of all the sites in the world, 28%, more than a quarter
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:44.840]   of every site you go to is a WordPress site, WordPress.com/twit.
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:45.840]   Set up your site.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:49.160]   If you have a business and you don't have a website, it's like you don't exist.
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:51.040]   I'm not kidding.
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.080]   You may say, "No, but I'm on Facebook or I have a Twitter handler."
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:55.320]   Yeah, good.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:58.920]   You shouldn't have that, but at any time, Facebook turned it off like that, Twitter could turn
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.280]   it off like that.
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.860]   You need to have a place that's yours that you call your own that you control and that's
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:06.200]   going to be at WordPress.com.
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:11.400]   Put your content up there, engage your customers when they find you, when they see your ad or
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:13.960]   whatever, they have somewhere to go.
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:17.920]   You put an ad in the yellow pages, you put a billboard up, you're going to want to put
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:18.920]   a web link.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.920]   See our Facebook page?
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:22.000]   You're going to want to put your business.com.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.720]   You can do it at WordPress.com.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:27.320]   And I know you don't do that right now because you don't want to be a web, you don't want
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.320]   to learn all that.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.320]   You don't want to learn anything.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.320]   It's easy.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:31.320]   Take my word for it.
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:33.720]   Go to WordPress.com/twit and try it.
[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:41.160]   You'll get 15% off a brand new website if you use that URL, WordPress.com/twit.
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:43.360]   The business plan lets you access hundreds of plugins and themes.
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:47.320]   You're part of a giant community at WordPress.com plus the best support ever.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:51.120]   I mean, these people will jump through hoops for you.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:53.160]   And I know because they've done it for me.
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:58.120]   WordPress.com/twit, the web's most popular and powerful site building platform.
[01:59:58.120 --> 01:59:59.120]   It's the best.
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:01.520]   I don't even want to use that phrase, site building platform.
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:03.280]   It's your new home on the internet.
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:06.560]   Try it, WordPress.com/twit.
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:09.840]   And now back to this week in tech.
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:10.840]   Thanks again, Leo.
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:14.700]   Now let's go ahead and bring it home with, I think we can all agree, is the feel good
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:20.360]   story of the week, and that is Equifax is incompetence is coming out even more.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:26.220]   We know last week that 143 million, basically 50% of all adults in the United States had
[02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:29.300]   their super sensitive information revealed.
[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:36.040]   That includes social securities, names, addresses, ages, driver's license numbers, credit history.
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:38.740]   That was all exposed, all breached.
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:43.980]   We've also known that Equifax has been a little hesitant in releasing details as to how it
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:44.980]   actually happened.
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:47.880]   A lot of analysts were saying, "I'm their admin."
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:49.040]   You're a genius.
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.100]   But what's coming out this week is it is worst case.
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:57.780]   It's what the security researchers had feared that this wasn't a zero day hack.
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:02.660]   This wasn't someone being very ingenious in social engineering their way into the system.
[02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:08.300]   This was, they didn't patch vulnerabilities in struts, and they left admin privileges
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:09.300]   at default.
[02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:14.660]   They had an admin web facing server that had the admin username of admin and the admin
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:18.740]   password of admin, which is absolutely fantastic.
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:19.740]   How did they guess?
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:21.220]   How evil genius did they?
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:23.500]   That's what I have on my luggage.
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:26.220]   But it's kind of a reverse psychology there though.
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:29.020]   We'll have great security if we have the dumbest possible password.
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:30.020]   They'll never guess that.
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:31.780]   They're pre forcing every other option.
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:34.220]   Everything else, because they surely couldn't have used admin.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.660]   They wouldn't be so stupid as to use the default password.
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:39.140]   I'm just going to skip that.
[02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:40.140]   That's what they were thinking.
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:45.940]   Now, there is a wrinkle that I actually covered this week on this weekend enterprise tech.
[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:51.060]   That's the fact that the people that they hired to do security at Equifax, who have for
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:56.660]   no related reason have decided to spend more time with their families, which is code for
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:58.220]   yeah, fired.
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:00.060]   Those are the same people who sold their stock.
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:01.060]   No, no, no.
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:03.660]   These are different people.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:05.020]   But they were in charge of security.
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:09.420]   They were in charge of making sure that the data was maintained properly.
[02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:12.180]   And we now know they have the search of security officer.
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:17.620]   They had no security background whatsoever, which is not super rare.
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:19.020]   You see that a lot.
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:22.820]   But you at least see people who have backgrounds in which they have practical experience and
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:23.820]   security.
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:27.660]   This was one of these things where one was an art appreciation major.
[02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:31.300]   You got to do something with all those people.
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:34.340]   And this is raising more questions than it's answering.
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:40.460]   It looks as if Equifax really thought security was just not something they had to worry about.
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:42.180]   You've covered a little bit of this story, Mark.
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:43.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:47.380]   Yeah, we broke news on the stock sales for those three executives.
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:50.940]   Yeah, it's a total mess.
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:57.020]   It also came out this week that as many as 400,000 people in the UK were also affected.
[02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:59.620]   They haven't released the data on Canadian citizens yet.
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:03.540]   Although they know, we know that Canadian citizens were included in the breach.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:07.060]   Not the same number, but yes, there's that.
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:12.940]   I think this is what's really bothering the security community in that first, it was six
[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:15.900]   weeks before they revealed that this breach had occurred.
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:19.740]   Secondly, you had executives who had been selling stock during that time.
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:26.180]   Third, they had obviously not done even the most minimum bit of security preparedness,
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:29.060]   you know, definitely not pen testing.
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:34.660]   And also the fact that it looks as if Equifax's whole culture was based around this idea of
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:37.860]   if we don't think about it, it just won't happen.
[02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:38.860]   And that's enraged a lot of people.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:43.300]   Yeah, I think one of the most frustrating things about this is unlike the Sony hack,
[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:46.100]   where like, yeah, I love my PlayStation.
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:51.540]   I gave up my information and now it's come out like I didn't choose to use Equifax.
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:52.540]   I don't love Equifax.
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:53.540]   Good point.
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:56.980]   I didn't want to give them my social security number and all of my private information,
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:04:02.340]   but you know, the system holds this hostage to these companies and clearly they're not
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:07.340]   even doing the one job, which is to protect the sensitive data that they hold.
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:10.740]   But I think at this point, I try to have a discussion with Leo and got nowhere in Twitter,
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:12.340]   so I'll try to get it.
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:13.340]   He was thinking about vacation.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:15.780]   He was already out of there.
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:20.860]   All this information, if it has already been breached, is going to be breached.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:21.860]   Right.
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:25.620]   So what we have to change now is not the security around the data that will be breached.
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:28.380]   It's instead around what could be done with it.
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:31.060]   So transactions have to become more secure.
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:34.460]   We've got to figure out that end of it so that who cares if you have somebody's name
[02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:37.380]   and address and birthday and that stuff.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:41.900]   Apart from stupid people and passwords, that have been admin, that'll never go away.
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:45.300]   But at some level, we've got to rethink the whole notion of transactions.
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:46.900]   I think there's only one solution.
[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:47.900]   There's only one solution.
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:49.300]   I'll get to you next, Owen.
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:53.420]   The one solution is to use the facial recognition feature on the iPhone.
[02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:56.220]   It's the only way to protect our financial transactions.
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:58.940]   There you have it, Owen.
[02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:01.940]   Mark said everything I wanted to say in a much calmer tone.
[02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:04.580]   I've been yelling at this.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:09.460]   And just to let people know, to be honest, I could give a hoot and or any about Apple.
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:10.460]   They don't pay my bills.
[02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:11.940]   I don't care about Bo Dega.
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:14.220]   I like yelling at stupid stuff because it gives me a release.
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:16.140]   I'm not really this angry upset.
[02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:20.300]   But I mean, when it comes to my social security number and the fact that Mark said you don't
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:23.380]   give that out, here's the coolest thing about that.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:30.980]   Now, this Annette Handicapped special needs company is going to try to sell you on protecting
[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:31.980]   your identity.
[02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:36.420]   Oh, come check us out and find out if we broke your stuff, which we already did.
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:41.900]   But here, give us $10 a month and we're going to monitor to make sure that nobody illegally
[02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:46.140]   used your information to do something harmful to you.
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:50.500]   Like they're trying to sell stuff to people and they haven't even admitted everything that
[02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:51.700]   they've done wrong.
[02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:52.980]   This is the world we live in.
[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:54.740]   Like I said, the humanity.
[02:05:54.740 --> 02:06:03.900]   I laugh in my heart because it's so serious, but we can't even do anything about it.
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:05.340]   It doesn't even matter.
[02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:12.460]   The fact that you're talking about a better security, when you have that level of information,
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:15.020]   there's not really much security you could do.
[02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:18.060]   Because with that, I can do anything.
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:20.700]   I mean, anything if you're smart.
[02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:25.060]   So I'm just going to sit here and hope that my credit score stays like a 640.
[02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:26.060]   I ain't got good credit.
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:27.060]   I'm not super worried about it.
[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:29.780]   I mean, I got to take cash or a thing I want anyway.
[02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:31.780]   But that's neither here nor there.
[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:32.780]   Don't judge me.
[02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:38.260]   Other people, other people I have to worry about their credit score.
[02:06:38.260 --> 02:06:40.020]   I'm thinking to myself, shoot.
[02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:41.020]   I had a roommate.
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:42.020]   He's got great credit.
[02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:43.020]   I still know his social.
[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:46.660]   I might as well just sneak in there and blame it on actual facts and go get me a new ride
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:47.660]   that's me.
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:48.660]   It's embarrassing.
[02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:49.660]   It's insane.
[02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:54.140]   It's absolutely insane that we just sit here like, oh, wow, admin admin.
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:55.460]   I had to laugh at it.
[02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:56.940]   And how sad is that?
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.180]   These companies should all take notice.
[02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:03.820]   Every single major institution in the world, she'd be like, oh, we should change it from
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:04.820]   one, two, three, right?
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.820]   Like, really?
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:06.820]   Okay.
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:07.820]   Everybody.
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:08.820]   Okay.
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:09.820]   Okay.
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:10.820]   Let's hire somebody.
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:11.820]   Do something.
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:12.820]   Call a cousin or a nephew and ask them how to like, show up your internet.
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:13.820]   I don't know what to say anymore.
[02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:14.820]   Here's my big fear.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:16.620]   The nuclear code is password, password.
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:18.260]   No password admin.
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:19.260]   That's how it works.
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:23.020]   Now, there is one good thing from this.
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:26.380]   If you've been watching the trend meters for Google and Facebook, because there are
[02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:30.980]   actually sites where you can see what are the queries.
[02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:36.220]   About midweek last week, you started to see much more of a trend of asking, what is a
[02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.220]   credit bureau?
[02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:38.220]   What is a CRC?
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:42.140]   And people are actually starting to realize these companies have all this information
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:43.140]   about me.
[02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:44.220]   I had no idea.
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:45.220]   Yeah.
[02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:48.140]   And they honestly, they did not connect their credit score with these companies that are
[02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:52.380]   maintaining vast amounts of information on their credit activity.
[02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:53.380]   That's actually a good thing.
[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:58.300]   That can spark a good conversation of, wait a minute, how do we decide who we entrust
[02:07:58.300 --> 02:07:59.300]   our data with?
[02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:05.100]   I mean, your point taken, I think we ultimately have to move to a society where this information
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:07.460]   can be in the open and I can still be secure.
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:08.460]   That's ultimately the goal.
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:14.980]   But it never hurts to have people start looking at who actually has access to their information.
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:17.060]   That could be one good thing that comes out of this.
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:20.100]   Now, Elizabeth Warren has already submitted legislation.
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:23.940]   She's trying to get support for it right now that would essentially make Equifax responsible
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:27.220]   for everyone that they've victimized for the rest of their lives.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:30.860]   I have no idea how, whether or not that's going to go through.
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:33.900]   And then you got, oh, yeah, let me, let me crack my seat.
[02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:35.460]   My credit score was an 820.
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:36.460]   Whoa.
[02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:38.460]   And now I decide this is 640.
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:42.580]   I was looking at a record case of Bill, go see, let me get a check.
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:44.740]   Go ahead and finish your sand.
[02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:45.740]   Apologies.
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:49.060]   We've had our first instance of fraud here live on.
[02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:50.060]   Come on.
[02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:52.340]   We can edit out the first one.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:54.980]   How you going to call me off of fraud?
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:09:03.060]   No, but I mean, honestly, if you could have an honest conversation with the average person,
[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:07.020]   let's talk about that average person again, who buys an iPhone because they like the
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:13.780]   style and get them to realize all the different places that are making money off of their
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:15.140]   information.
[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:19.980]   Do you then make a more informed populace or is this one of these things that's in one
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:21.340]   year out the other?
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:22.340]   People don't care.
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:26.060]   I think it's a look what happened to you where cookies, cookies are evil.
[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:27.060]   Cookies are cracking.
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:28.060]   You cookies are awful.
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:30.420]   So on every single sign out of Europe, that's okay.
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.420]   Okay.
[02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:32.420]   Cookies.
[02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:33.420]   Okay.
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:34.420]   Okay.
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:35.420]   Cookies.
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:36.420]   Right.
[02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:40.580]   And now we have the GDPR, the privacy regulations coming in May 2018 in Europe.
[02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:45.660]   And I think that I think it was Dana Boyd who taught me long ago.
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:47.860]   You don't want to regulate knowledge.
[02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:50.580]   You want to regulate the use of the knowledge.
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:54.020]   The fact that somebody was, has his name and was born this date and their mother was
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:56.100]   named that, that's just knowledge.
[02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:57.940]   What you can do with it is the issue.
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:05.380]   The fact that I have prematurely gray hair and you choose not to hire me because of it,
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:09.300]   I can't make you not know unless I'm in men and black that you haven't seen me.
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:10.580]   You don't know how old I am.
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:14.500]   But if you don't hire old farts like me 10 times in a row, the use of that knowledge
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:15.500]   is wrong.
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:19.540]   We've got to change the whole paradigm here around this.
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:20.980]   And I don't hear that discussion happening.
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:21.980]   I really don't.
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:22.980]   All right.
[02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:23.980]   Well, be Bitcoin.
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:25.980]   Bitcoin is going to solve it all.
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:28.780]   Apple and Bitcoin will solve it all right on.
[02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:29.780]   Quick question.
[02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:30.780]   Yeah.
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:32.340]   Have you all set your fraud alerts already?
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:34.940]   I am not.
[02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:36.260]   What do I need to do?
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:37.260]   Okay.
[02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:39.460]   I just, what did I tell you?
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:45.420]   People spend $41 a month on an iPhone plan and don't have life insurance.
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:46.580]   We don't care.
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:49.020]   I started the show telling you this is America.
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:50.260]   We're not worried about that.
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:51.260]   Okay.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:52.260]   I'm sitting here watching a football game.
[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:53.860]   I'm paying attention to y'all right now.
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:56.060]   And you think we don't set fraud alerts?
[02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:57.060]   Fraud alerts?
[02:10:57.060 --> 02:10:58.060]   Who's winning?
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:00.420]   I'm from the hood B. I'm worried about the fraud down the street with them trying to
[02:11:00.420 --> 02:11:01.980]   sell me a car from Leroy.
[02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:02.980]   Not.
[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:03.980]   That facts.
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:04.980]   I'm just saying.
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:05.980]   Okay.
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:06.980]   Let's do it.
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:08.820]   Quick public service announcement here.
[02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:13.220]   Right now if you don't have a fraud alert before the show actually ends you could go
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:16.420]   to fraud.transunion.com.
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:18.500]   You have to enter in some personally identify information.
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:19.500]   Oh, good.
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:20.500]   It's not Equifax.
[02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:21.500]   It's not Equifax.
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:22.780]   So it's a different.
[02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:26.700]   It's one of the other big three CRCs credit reporting companies.
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:30.620]   It once you report it to one they report it to the others.
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:33.780]   So you just have to do it once you can do it entirely online.
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:36.940]   The nice thing about this it will give you a reminder when it's about to it.
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:38.060]   You expire.
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:41.020]   So once it expires you just renew it.
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:42.620]   So it's good for 90 days.
[02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:48.820]   Now if you actually detect action in your credit report someone has tried to use your
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:53.340]   ID you can get a fraud alert that lasts for seven years.
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:55.500]   And again that's free and you just do it once.
[02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:59.660]   But there is a difference here between a credit alert a fraud alert which is what we're talking
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:03.300]   about right now and what Leo is advocating which is a credit freeze.
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:04.300]   Which I've had to do.
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:05.300]   Which you've had to do.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:07.500]   You don't need a fraud alert.
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:12.380]   The difference is when you do a fraud alert companies can still get your credit report
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:17.100]   but they get a bit of information saying this identity may be compromised.
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:20.980]   Here's a number you should call which will put you in touch with the actual person so
[02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:23.900]   you can verify whether or not this is them.
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:26.500]   In a credit freeze they can't even see that.
[02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:28.740]   They see nothing until you whitelist them.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:29.740]   Right.
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:32.060]   Because what was happening to me I don't know what I say is not allowed.
[02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:36.060]   People were to harass me they were just getting credit cards in my name.
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:37.060]   Yep.
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:38.060]   Right.
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:39.780]   And so the credit freeze means now they can't do that.
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:40.780]   Yes.
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:43.300]   And it's a pain but I'm old and I already have my house and I'm not going to be getting
[02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:45.780]   any credit because unless it's to get the money.
[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:48.460]   But you should know and people should know that if you do put a credit freeze it will
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:52.260]   affect you in things other than applying for loans or credit cards.
[02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:55.060]   If you apply for a new job one of the first things they'll do is they'll check your credit
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:59.140]   history because that will determine whether or not you're trustworthy employee.
[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:03.540]   If when you go to buy a new phone they will check your credit history so you have to whitelist
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:04.540]   that.
[02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:07.580]   You will find yourselves in a lot of situations where you have to take the extra step to jump
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:11.500]   into the app give your pin and make sure that okay I'm going to whitelist.
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:12.500]   Pin.
[02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:13.500]   I forget the pin.
[02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:14.500]   Yeah.
[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:15.500]   Where's the pin?
[02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:17.940]   Oh and you seem unimpressed.
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:22.260]   Like I said you lost me at go give somebody else some more information to confirm that
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:26.100]   I am who I am and then I got to wait for them to call me back on the call back with the
[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:30.180]   call back and now all of a sudden I can't get a new iPhone X because my credit just
[02:13:30.180 --> 02:13:33.700]   dropped 32 points because I've been checked it 14 times I had to wait for the call to
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:34.700]   get back.
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:38.820]   So yes no I'm not alert my fraud I'm going to roll with these punches to see how it happens
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:41.060]   and worry about it at the other end.
[02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:44.460]   You can do the fraud alert it's not a it's not a freeze and remember it's free.
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:45.460]   Totally free.
[02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:46.460]   Completely free.
[02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:47.460]   What do I got to do to get that again?
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:50.260]   Yes the first thing I got to do fraud that trail.
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:51.260]   Yeah.
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:52.260]   Okay.
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:53.260]   How about this?
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:59.860]   You can use my information and then you could put a fraud alert on my account I guess.
[02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:00.860]   Okay.
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:01.860]   Yeah.
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:02.860]   That's you never know.
[02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:03.860]   That doesn't work.
[02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:09.660]   You have to trust somebody right if you don't trust somebody you know who I trust the same
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:11.580]   person you trust.
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:13.580]   Leo the Lord.
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:14.580]   Oh yeah.
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:18.780]   Oh he's got a phenomenal credit score.
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:19.780]   There you go.
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:22.620]   You got a friend in me that's who you trust brother.
[02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:24.620]   That's a proud.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:28.140]   Oh gentlemen gentlemen this has been a lot of fun.
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:31.300]   I think I think we have to start calling it an and here.
[02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:34.380]   Was there any story that's in the duck we had a lot there that you really wanted to
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:37.500]   talk about that we didn't cover I just I just want to make sure everyone's happy here.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:38.500]   You had all one.
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:39.740]   Yeah I'm happy.
[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:40.740]   You're happy Owen.
[02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:41.740]   He's never good.
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:42.940]   I got what I want.
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:43.940]   I'm always happy.
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:45.900]   I'm the happiest person in this panel.
[02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:46.900]   Yes.
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:48.820]   I actually I will admit that.
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:51.700]   Thank you all for making this so enjoyable.
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:54.660]   I didn't know I was going to be doing this until a couple of hours ago but I love doing
[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:55.660]   to it.
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:15:00.220]   It is one of my favorite shows just because I get to talk tech I get to talk geek.
[02:15:00.220 --> 02:15:03.820]   Let's let's go around the table and make sure everyone knows what you're doing where
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:05.220]   they can find you mark.
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:09.320]   If people wanted to find out more about your work more about what your your your publication
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:14.900]   has done to expose things like incompetent set Equifax where can they go.
[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:20.700]   They can go to Bloomberg.com/tech for all of our tech coverage from around the world.
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:22.460]   And I am at mark million on Twitter.
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:23.460]   All right.
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:27.180]   And he is one of the chilest people I know in tech.
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:29.300]   Honestly, nothing phases you.
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:30.740]   I have never seen you angry.
[02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:31.740]   Keeping it chill.
[02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:32.740]   Yeah.
[02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:37.660]   Is there a story we could cover that might make you you know go off on a rant like like
[02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:38.660]   Owen.
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:42.660]   I don't think I could ever match Owen.
[02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:45.820]   I don't think anyone could potentially match Owen.
[02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:50.660]   Oh doctor where can they find you when you're not hiding in the black background of.
[02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:51.660]   Salas.
[02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:53.620]   First of all, I love Jeff.
[02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:55.620]   I do a podcast.
[02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:57.260]   I got to get you on my podcast.
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:15:58.500]   Mark I get you on podcast.
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:01.260]   Padre we got to reschedule because we're supposed to do that.
[02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:05.900]   Secondly, Mark is like my inner being if we couldn't both be the same.
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:07.980]   I'm not trying to have us be twins on the show.
[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:10.180]   So I'm I'm Mark's spirit animal.
[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:11.180]   He's my spirit animal.
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:12.420]   We just switch up for the show.
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:13.420]   That's really how it's going down.
[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:14.420]   I feel it man.
[02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:15.420]   Pro.
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:18.180]   IQMC.com is where you can find all my stuff.
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:22.140]   I don't do anything else if not it's fraud because I'm a doctor and everything.
[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:26.700]   But what I really wanted to show you guys was I got a twin fan that gave me this shirt
[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:28.900]   and it says sorry.
[02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:29.900]   Oh no.
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:36.340]   You know you have any idea how black you were driving and it's and it's from urban profilers
[02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:39.220]   one of the twin nation or Senate semi.
[02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:41.540]   So I want to give him a shout out because I thought that was a funny shirt because I
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:43.620]   get pulled over all the time.
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:44.620]   But great show.
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:45.620]   Love the show.
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:47.660]   I loved Ranton and Yell on the stuff and Jeff.
[02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:49.220]   We love your ramming.
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:50.980]   You're more on my team than usual.
[02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:54.780]   I'm glad we're all getting the iPhone X the pixel.
[02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:55.780]   I was a notch.
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:56.780]   You kidding me?
[02:16:56.780 --> 02:16:57.780]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:16:59.580]   I I hope Google does something with that.
[02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:00.580]   But that's all I want to say.
[02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:02.580]   I love you guys had a great shows fun.
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:04.420]   Let a chat room to the chat room is the best.
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:05.580]   They're smart and all of us.
[02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:08.220]   They only had time to read half of the information.
[02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:09.540]   They're pouring in to us.
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:10.820]   You know, that's why I get all my good tidbits.
[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:12.780]   That's why I sound like I know what I'm doing.
[02:17:12.780 --> 02:17:14.140]   Oh and JJ Stone again.
[02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:17.460]   Oh, doctor always a pleasure and speaking of pleasures.
[02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:20.620]   Again, the fact that I get to work with you officially for the first time.
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:25.060]   I saw each other at the Christmas party way back in the brick house.
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:27.500]   But of course they're going to find you at in New York.
[02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:29.780]   They're going to find you writing wonderful stories.
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:31.980]   Buzzmachine.com is a blog.
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:34.860]   Medium, Matt, Jeff Jarvis, Twitter, Rajev Jarvis.
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:38.260]   But if you read that, you know too much.
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:43.380]   There's still a story that goes around the studio anytime we talk about standards and
[02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:45.260]   how they're different from country to country.
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:49.820]   I was watching live when you had your BBC appearance and you said crap.
[02:17:49.820 --> 02:17:50.340]   Yes.
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:52.580]   And evidently that's horrible.
[02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:53.820]   I got in the UK.
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:56.220]   It's terrible.
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:57.660]   It's I had no idea.
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:17:59.020]   I had no one had any idea.
[02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:03.820]   Because I was I was going to say the S word and I thought I was going safe by using the
[02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:04.460]   crap word.
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:07.180]   I think I think you actually would have been safe using the S word.
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:07.780]   I think I could have.
[02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:08.780]   I think I could have.
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:09.220]   Yeah.
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:10.580]   You have to say, "Shite."
[02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:11.140]   Yeah.
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:15.660]   See Ian, Ian Thompson has taught me to just say bollocks or dogs bollocks.
[02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:16.180]   I can't wait.
[02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:17.820]   One of those is one of those is good.
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:19.620]   Bollocks is bad and dogs bollocks is good.
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:22.300]   I don't understand how that works, but but that's it.
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:23.060]   Yeah.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:24.220]   I'm not going there now.
[02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:25.180]   Not at all.
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:29.620]   Folks, don't forget that we do Twitch every Sunday starting at three o'clock p.m.
