[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.820]   Very kind of yeah, I love it. I read it every day Doc Rock is also here from whole
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.060]   community manager to eat cam and a regular on many of our shows hi Doc
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.180]   Man, it's so good to be here. I'm happy to be back state-sided and having a good time. Where were you? I?
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.540]   Was in Japan for the last two weeks of the year. It was so good
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.020]   I left here on New Year's Eve and got back home when you're Z
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.700]   So I almost got a chance to you know watch the countdown twice
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.180]   But then the plane took over early enough. Oh took the early flight instead of the later flight
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.640]   Wouldn't that be you could you actually do that the flight with their
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:09.140]   Because of the the international date like what would happen is I would stay in Japan do the countdown and then take the 5am flight out of
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.940]   Osaka get back to home back to yesterday 9am and do it again. Yeah
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.460]   How long does it take to go from Osaka to Honolulu?
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.020]   You know super funny and this just blows people's mind on the way there
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.740]   It's a nine and a half ten hour flight still on on the way back. It's a six hour flight. Whoa, it's like well
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.540]   How's it faster to come back? I don't know this maybe that round hill. I miss spitting. Yeah, it's downhill. Never knows that
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.660]   No, it's the jet. People don't get it. I'm like the globe is spinning underneath your room. Maybe it's pushing you home
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.460]   Wow, I've got a lot because I've always wanted to go but there's going to Japan ruin you for Japanese food anywhere else in the world
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.180]   180%
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.500]   Damn it. Why I have taken it upon myself to learn to cook Japanese food really well myself
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.820]   But luckily I live in Honolulu because we have a very good Japanese contingency here
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.540]   You can get good Japanese food here and then you get good Japanese food in the bay and you get good Japanese food in Los Angeles and San Diego
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.060]   So well, I mean I took my I took my sister when she came over to a Japanese very good Japanese
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.420]   sushi bar in in San Francisco and she just looked at me and went you've ruined me for London sushi and
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.220]   I'm wondering if it was the same for Japan
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.100]   Yes, yes, so San Francisco has a pretty decent sushi culture
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.700]   So the Seattle because the water is cold enough and you know good enough
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.060]   Places that have warmer water with sushi culture
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.140]   I was like I don't think that works because what makes Japan sushi so good is that ice cold water just makes really good fatty tuna and
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.460]   Stop just stop
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.340]   When I went to Japan they have so many foods that obviously aren't sushi that are so freakin delicious
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.260]   It's sushi's just a little corner of the Japanese is tiny sliver
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.340]   Yeah, a hundred percent although so my favorite hiking food is just onigiri because you know you just wrap it up in the little rice
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.220]   And it's it's got everything you need and you can it's so portable
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:17.300]   And I finally found a place actually here on Bainbridge that makes it for it like does a good onigiri that I could now pack my
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.460]   Yourself
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.220]   See the show and Leo and I talk about rice cookers
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.340]   And then I'll give you some cool stuff to put in it and if you live close enough to
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.340]   a Japanese
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:39.180]   Ujima
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.580]   And they have all of the right stuff you need to put in it
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.020]   It's super easy and you can actually get the good quality rice at the ujima way over there as well
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.260]   So oh my god, it's so simple. It's so simple. I know it's easy. It's just out of leftovers
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.020]   But I like it cuz like you could walk into a gas station in Japan. There's just like this is our gas station food
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.820]   I'm like your gas station food is so much better than ours
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:10.380]   Is oh we're me dining man. Yeah, so
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.900]   Japan does Kit Kats like nobody else. I mean
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.600]   I love my sabi Kit Kats. Yeah with sabi green tea
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.180]   Karaoke, it's just marvellous a friend of mine came back from Japan and bought those
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.020]   He said you know love this and see that big carrier bag of really weird Kit Kats on the table
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.220]   That lasted us a week and some you know intergestion, but it was interesting is Hawaiian
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.020]   Was soupy kind of their version of onigiri that it's the right
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.020]   Yeah, it's the same
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:49.140]   Started the moosey started as a oding-giddy, but when we first started to get you know
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.700]   The quote unquote hopper right half Japanese, you know because of people that moved here after the war
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.740]   Yeah, they just became part of the culture. So you can get moosey B with hot dogs ticking spam
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.060]   You don't like spam. I mean, there's other moosey bees as well. Yeah, you know from now on instead of peeps. I want these
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.180]   every
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.820]   Bento culture will blow your mind. Oh, I love that very cool
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.220]   Characters from like your kids favorite TV show
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.300]   There shows to show you how to make those characters as bentos for your kids
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:28.980]   And it's the clever way that Japanese mothers get their kids to love vegetables from the gate is they always do it
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.060]   And really cool when we were also pickled and they're delicious. Oh, yeah
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.940]   When we were in Japan a couple of years ago
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.140]   We went to like a lunch bar that had a konamiaki, which is those pancakes
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:49.220]   I went to a konamiaki and I watched these guys make they make it in front of you with such a panache
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.980]   It is wild
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.740]   And I went to a konamiaki school in Hiroshima
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.620]   No, and it is so much fun at the oto fuku
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.140]   You know the sauce that you put on the top. Yeah, that makes it is called otofuku
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.500]   So they have a school you can go to know how to do it. It is such a blast
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.940]   If you ever in Hiroshima you get is not Hiroshima people in Hiroshima. You ever get a chance to go there
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.940]   Just do that. It is the dopest experience actually that's that might be where we had it come to think of it
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.980]   Is it so good? All right, that was our Japanese food segment. Thanks for joining us
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.220]   You know you invite me as good. I have
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:31.340]   Sorry, you know, I will say there is a Japanese food robot at CES. It's a brand new one for
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.820]   Let's see
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.560]   It's a ramen. It's yeah, it's what it makes ramen
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:47.300]   Yeah, oh my gosh, it's delicious. You're kind. I've had it. You're okay. You're okay. That's it. I was like it's a desktop ramen robot
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.360]   Until I come to the US I'd never tasted ramen
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:09:00.820]   Every culture has a noodle though noodle soup like this though. I think it's universal. Yes. Yeah, all noodle soup
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.940]   But ramen is also great matzo ball soup, but I love it
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.900]   The name is cool because you okay are basically poltergeist. Oh
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.180]   So these are there we go. These are ghosts in the machine the making your your ramen ramen
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:21.860]   I would rather just go to a ramen shop. They're quite a few ramen shops in the Bay Area. I would just I'll go down there
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.180]   So this is what they're for they're designed for
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:31.580]   They they started with a vending machine a big one and it was designed for like your hotel lobby like so you got
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.580]   It's okay, and you just pour it in your
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.260]   This stuff. Yes, they do they you get the best Americans do too
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.220]   I guess so but the things you can get in the Japanese vending machine or unlike anywhere else in the world. Oh
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.620]   So good
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:53.820]   They've got coffee hot and cold. They've got it's kind of amazing what you can get you see the Dutch do this as well
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.580]   They have vending machines built into the walls in Amsterdam for example usually just outside
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:06.340]   Smoking cafes where I was very very starting. Yeah, but I mean it's hot food in a you know in a vending machine
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:12.300]   And you put your stuff in but the Japanese take it to just the perfect level. Let's actually stay on food
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.300]   Did you see any other food related?
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.020]   stuff at CES I
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.260]   saw the budget thermo mix oh
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:27.860]   Exciting because I have the unfortunately the expensive just like you got me to buy the real June of and instead of the less expensive one
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.860]   They sell now
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:37.180]   Okay, so that was early adopter. Yeah, I know it is not for thermo mix it is it is from another company and
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:45.140]   Thermo mix is a weird device which Stacy told me about and of course I immediately purchased that's a blender that heats up
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.460]   You could cook anything in it soups
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:55.540]   It makes the best mashed potatoes I've ever had in under a half an hour. It makes the best for so go mother then but no
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.420]   Oh, we'll have a mashed potato off
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:04.700]   I'll have to fly her over. Yeah, we're on if she brings the bangers. I got the mash and
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:13.980]   So yeah, so the I you know I think this is actually interesting the CES used to be a lot of PCs and
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.620]   Then there would be a car section which was like kind of
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.060]   You know car accessories
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:27.140]   There'd be a sound section, but really because computing has really migrated into every part of your life
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:32.860]   It's everything now including some real electronics. Yeah, it's all something more now. Yeah, yeah
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.740]   It was honestly
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.100]   It's more than just overwhelming as like like there's whole sections of the show
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:45.060]   I don't even care about like and so if you don't ask me about all that I mean new whole new cars were launched there
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.060]   Oh, yeah, but we have Samable
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.700]   You don't have to go into the North Hall and I was like say out of the North Hall. I
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.500]   Did a West Hall. Yeah
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:00.820]   Yeah, and so broad picture y'all broad picture. No one was there. No one was it what
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:08.300]   There was only so they said there was they were expecting a hundred thousand people which is down from a hundred and seventy thousand
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.380]   Which was CES 2020 before the pandemic, right? Yeah, I
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.580]   cannot believe those people were actually all there like
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:21.460]   In for anyone who goes to CES when you're going like in the Venetian for example
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.340]   You know you're going into what was the sands now?
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.500]   They call it the Venetian Expo you are like wall to wall packed with people. It is a nightmare
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.100]   getting into these spaces
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:38.940]   Nothing like there were like people could walk in groups like three abreast and you can still bypass them. Wow
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.580]   That's whole day. That's a whole different game. I mean, what was the cue like for press conferences?
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.620]   Because it used to be you'd have nothing in half hours press conference. Yeah, get turned away
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:54.300]   Oh, or you just to take the shuttle really back to your hotel. It was better to walk. Oh, it was always awful
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:00.260]   The cab lines. I don't know the cab lines weren't there weren't bad because that's the metric for me if you get there weren't
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.940]   Cab lines. Oh, I walked out of the airport and I just walked right there
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.860]   I got my badge at the airport because I always do but I didn't wait in line like I just walked right up
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:17.500]   For people who don't do this and of course it's a very specialized thing that you know mostly tech journalists
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.980]   But it was full of masochism, but yeah
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.940]   Reason people like Ian say that is because it usually is very very crowded
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:32.620]   It's almost impossible to get around you've got appointments that you just can't get to you there are you
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.460]   There are more things you could see in a lifetime let alone three or four days
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.940]   It's still going on. It was late this year started on Wednesday. It's going through at the end of the day today
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.980]   It's shorter too. So it started when it's only four days usually it's five
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.500]   Oh, so that's another thing and then the floor space at like unveiled or pebcom
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.180]   Which are these things where companies will pay very expensive?
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:02.380]   evening events that come piss up is one of those things you need to get through CES because it's good food good cheap
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.860]   Well, good for you. So the story behind this is there's these two of them showstoppers in pebcom
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:12.540]   They're probably more CES has it unveiled as well and and the companies pay huge amounts of money to be there because
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:20.220]   They're smaller and there are a lot of lazy journalists in the world who go to showstoppers in pebcom
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:25.740]   File their stories then go home. So if yep, and usually they file that yeah
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.580]   They file the story about the first thing they saw coming in the door
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:35.340]   That's why you saw the vibrating haptic fork three years ago because it was the first thing
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.700]   And they never became a product by the way. Nobody wanted
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:46.380]   Last when we went in 2020 the last one before covid it was a toilet roll robot at the front door
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.100]   Everybody caught remember that one right yeah, and it never comes out. It's not a real product
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.260]   but they spent 10 grand and
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.260]   Claude pepper gutters or whatever his name has got his money
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.660]   They have chocolate fountains and food because journalists are or whores for food
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.340]   And uh, and it's I think it's kind of scammy to be honest
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.860]   Honestly, I think hoses a bit strong because one thing I would say is with vegas when it comes to food
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.220]   You've got good cheap and available and pick two of those
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:21.740]   You know, it's just you know, so you go to pebcom because it's good food. It's free
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.740]   It's the end of the day. You need to unwind
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:30.700]   I've got I've been to what 10 pebcon or the other events. I've got two stories out of it
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.540]   Yeah, one of which I have to say I'm not a cheesy term. Yeah, you're not a cheesy
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:41.100]   Hold up. Okay. Okay counterpoint. Yes counterpoint. What did you see this year? Yes
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.220]   Um, there was less um, there was definitely less
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.260]   Um
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.140]   I like it because it's an easier way for me to talk to the people. Oh, absolutely. They have their executives there
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.900]   Absolutely. And so like I agree for the smart and there's always the smart home people
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.860]   So I can always snag the ceo for like a minute
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.940]   So the stuff that the stuff that you cover
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.420]   Okay, the stuff that you oh, we're we're used to this it happens all the time the stuff that you
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.300]   Stacey
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.420]   I'm constantly eating. I can't breathe. I can't drink something fluent in her mouth. Don't worry about it. She'll be fine
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.420]   so this
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.300]   The stuff you cover is well covered. I guess at these
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.540]   Shows
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.580]   But it is a fraction of the total at sea. Yes. Oh, yeah, it's 50 or 60 booths
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.220]   I can get oh no, it's it's probably like a hundred and thirty this year
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:35.500]   It was like 130 sometimes that's as many as 200 this year. They were actually like oh my gosh
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.420]   There were like empty spaces and you can see they spaced everyone
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.500]   I mean it was it was definitely
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.020]   In order to fake it they did and then they had a whole media room
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.420]   Have you ever seen a media room at no?
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.820]   I think it was pebcom though with it. No, because they don't have room because that's like free space. They would never give away
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.100]   What do you need it for?
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.100]   So ces
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.740]   That used to be hard enough right there'd be so crowded just finding a good place to sit
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.100]   I would always watch the creative ways people would find to
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.340]   carpet
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.500]   And then of course the the happening spot was you know
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:16.700]   They always overlapped avn with ces because in the beginning of time adult video expert expo
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.340]   Right when at the beginning of time when we first got you know dvd ROM capabilities
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:25.580]   Right and go back earlier than vhs tapes the first point oh
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:32.540]   Right when they would figure out this the way I can get my industry to talk to the nerd industry at the same time to make their industry better
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.060]   Which is why of e-commerce?
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.700]   They were the sort of the biggest and everybody always just blamed it on the fact that it was ill repute
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.340]   But no they were at the tank conferences all the time they sent themselves up perfectly
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.780]   So it used to be this kind of like gap in the hallway between the main center and the flamingo center
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:54.220]   And there was like a little bridge. I used to just all watch all the nerds sit there to just sit there and get a gander
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:18:02.860]   I'm so glad they not only moved off site. They've now moved a different time of the year and it knows it was four through seven this year
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:08.060]   I just looked at it. I moved it back. They crisscrossed it again. Yeah, they crisscrossed for a while. It was at a different time
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:14.620]   So I didn't run into any adult performers. Thank you. That means they moved into a different
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:21.660]   I mean about was it seven years ago when they were still doing it and thing I met an adult performer who
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:30.380]   Built gaming PCs in the spare time. Oh, yeah. Um, oh, yeah, I mean it was this whole industry especially the webcam industry is very techy
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:36.860]   Uh, well, they've it pushed it pushed digital video and we'd be lying if we said it didn't like it really did
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.860]   It made a big deal. So ces claims
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.620]   That uh, there were 112,000 people there
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:48.300]   But if you even just look at this little space he's saying that's something look at this picture of the central hall
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:53.820]   Where there's actually room to walk. That's here. I'll show the can I see?
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:19:00.540]   I think I can share a google photo video with you. Um, oh mama. We're gonna get fancy here, ladies and gentlemen
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:06.380]   By the way, I love this vest you're worrying. What is that? That is so cool. This is my Han Solo vest
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:11.580]   No, that's great. It's very cool. You look like yeah, just say just do this for me
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.820]   I got a bad feeling about this
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.460]   I'm just gonna say shamelessly say that if you were using e-cam you could share anything you want it right away
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:25.260]   I'm create. I'm just I'm doing it via create a link. I've got to copy it and I'm gonna put it on say shoot first
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.380]   Where am I going?
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.940]   That's so good. Oh god. That's terrible
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.220]   I'm sorry, but I couldn't resist
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.700]   No, no, it looks good on you though. It really looks good on you. Yeah, I think it's a good
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.860]   It's I didn't realize it was Han Solo
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:48.620]   It's it's not really it's just a it's cool. I like this. It's like is it leather? I like that it's leather
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:54.620]   Well, that's good. You don't want any animals to die. That's good. Yeah, no animals died to make this vest some some dead plastics
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.420]   Some dead that large molecules
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:02.540]   Well, I suppose technically some animals did die in the terms of way way a long time before we
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.620]   Oh wow, you really you really did that somebody yelled at that guy
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:15.180]   Somebody yelled at me once because I said that oil was made of dead dinosaurs and they said no no lino
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.740]   It wasn't the dinosaurs. Mostly trees
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:24.060]   It is true basically plants. There's no dinosaur should there. So I find all right. Okay, fine. I think I
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:30.380]   I put it in the rundown. I just had I had to do that. I have the I have the rundown so
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.060]   Wait, wait, you put it in the right hand. You put it in the right hand. That's not gonna
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.580]   I mean I can get there. I went to the wrong place initially
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:43.340]   I think I put it in the twit rundown. Okay, that would be better. Stacy as you know is a regular on the other show
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.180]   Uh, and it has a rundown too, but it's not the same
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.100]   All right, where did I put it in the right spot?
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:59.180]   Cool. Oh here. Yes. I did this next to my name vegas without being in vegas that one. That was me
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.740]   That was you no no no. It's it's literally next to my name up top. Oh good good place to put it
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.980]   Okay, here we go ladies and gentlemen with a this is your video
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.180]   And it's sideways video, but that's okay. This is if you
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.460]   In the uh going down the hall. Oh, there's nobody there
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:21.180]   That is great. I mean that is in between you. I mean that's right now people may look at that and they say well
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.180]   That looks like grand central station
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:28.620]   But it's not even close. It could be so much worse. It could be no. I mean this
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.580]   Literally jam packed with people. Sorry. I mean usually that conference all really challenges
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.780]   Challenges you to it as a polite Brit because it's just like yeah, excuse me. Excuse me in an after about two seconds
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.780]   You're like fucking coming through
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.620]   You know, yeah, yeah
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.580]   So not a lot of people mess either I might point out
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.620]   Yeah, I was yeah good
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.220]   How was the airport because that's traditionally the standard of you know, I mean
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.740]   If you've got a queue for like four hours to get through security
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:04.700]   No one no one anywhere. Huh? It was crazy. So maybe there is representing because so typically it's 170
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:10.300]   180 000 people they're saying 112 000 which is you know, that's a lot less 12 000 people
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.860]   That is that is Friday at like noon
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.420]   She's yeah, it's just peak time
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.900]   But was it worth going stacy was there stuff there that you're really glad you went to see
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.140]   I mean, I
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.860]   Okay, I got sick. That was my third respiratory infection in like three or two weeks
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.420]   So yeah, usually people get sick at Vegas at CES, but then they come home and bring it and spread it
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.740]   But you got sick right there
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.860]   There were several articles about how much
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.100]   P there was on the show floor so to speak
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.980]   So this pisses me off
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:52.860]   Tell me tell me stacy tell me how you feel
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.300]   There was so much
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.660]   I call it digital snake oil wellness tech
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:07.580]   And so why things and why things actually does try to get FDA approval for their stuff and they're you scan thing
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.660]   This is a your analysis kit
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:15.580]   It's made up of a reader that you stick in your toilet and then you stick these cartridges in that for 100
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:21.020]   They you could pee on at 100 and tie 100 times. Who's does it count for you or do you have to keep track?
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.180]   Well, there is a little
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.140]   Yes, there's definitely an app there is an app for that
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:32.540]   Um, they they use microfluidics inside so each test. I guess I don't know if it goes down the toilet
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.300]   That's a good question. Is this Elizabeth's home style testing? I mean, is it real?
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:42.220]   Well, so they're applying for FDA approval, but they don't have it. Uh why things is a little bit more
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.940]   Like they are trying to have a lot of their stuff. I like why I think it's yeah
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.980]   So they they are in Europe already. So I'm assuming we might get it here
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.700]   So what does it do only a little bit more straight?
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.740]   What does it do?
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.220]   So you pee on it and there are two different types of tests that you can buy
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.780]   One is a menstrual cycle test
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.140]   Two is a two mensory diet test
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.220]   No, no, no, no
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.180]   The hormones it goes into the pee. Okay. I apologize everybody for this subject
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.860]   But we have to cover it because you do not need to apologize
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.140]   Everybody
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.140]   Is it a real mensory?
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   So
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.620]   So all you do and it's don't make me yell at you. Is it placed?
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.580]   Yeah, I know
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.260]   Is it placed strategically so that you don't have to really aim? It's just gonna get it
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.420]   And they say it could tell the difference in toilet water and it can even distinguish
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:42.460]   They have an infrared sensor on it. So if it's warm, it's pee. Oh, that's smart. Okay. Let's just tell it works
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:48.540]   And then uh, and it can distinguish people right so multiple people can use it
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.780]   Yes, multiple people cannot use it only one person per reader. Oh, um, okay
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.740]   Part of that is I mean, I guess multiple people
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.140]   Could you say but the test omega that it only goes to the one that
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.220]   Have to be pretty rich to have each person in the house have their own toilet
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.940]   Well, also you don't have toilets in our house
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.820]   And put them off again surely because if it's one person
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.580]   It does come with gloves. I don't want to handle it. Okay. Well, that's perfectly awful
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.260]   I mean, you don't the reader goes in there and you change out the cartridge
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.020]   Here's here's where it makes sense and I know it's going to sound funny to people
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:31.820]   But like I had a diabetic in my family and one exactly used to do is used to check for sugar
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.220]   Different levels. Yeah, you're into this right
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.380]   So if it doesn't matter the rest of us are going to use it
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.940]   It would matter where my stepmom would use it because that way we would know
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:49.580]   Get early warnings. Yes. She was having something that was long-term even if she wasn't doing finger pricks or anything else
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.940]   Right. That's right. That's what as I remember. That's what diabetes means
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.380]   G or piece tastes terrific or something like it's sweet
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.340]   That's how they used to be an old test
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.500]   They would test they would taste it. Yeah, they would taste the urine to see it. Okay. So yes
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:10.940]   I'm 100 with you on this but instead they're going right now after this wellness fitness market that is less
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.940]   They're not doing diabetes tests. They're not they will get there. Interesting. And maybe
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:25.100]   I mean, they're not right now. That's not available and then they're they don't have a really good sense on privacy around
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:31.180]   Now they say they won't share but obviously if like a lawyer or someone comes in if law enforcement comes with a subpoena
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.340]   They don't have an answer for how they would protect that data, which well furthermore it could have
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.900]   Couldn't you put
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.420]   Surruptitious drug tests in it. I mean it seems like there's yeah
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:47.660]   I mean you could you could stick that well, but you could also surreptitiously drug test your employees like anyway without this
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.660]   I mean you wouldn't know
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.700]   now
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.220]   If you were like a parent and wanted a surreptitious drug test
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.740]   But but you can see it in the toilet. It's not like a secret
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.140]   I was gonna say I mean it's difficult to surreptitiously when you've got a distinctly pay on something
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.940]   But I think you're I mean the the real market for this is companies doing drug tests
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.820]   um the old parents doing drug tests
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:15.180]   I think there's a good market in like home health care or in like
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.940]   One of those group homes for elderly people, but it's interesting
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:26.380]   They seem like they're going after the the quantified self-crew the people who bought these fit bits and early apple watches and stuff
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.540]   Who are athletes or they just want to keep an eye on their you know
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.340]   What's their athletes? Yeah
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.820]   The main thing about the medical test right?
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:42.380]   Medical tests for vitamin C ketones pH levels and specific gravity for water balance
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.820]   so
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:49.820]   The ketones things is going to get all of the you know the athletic greens crowd if you will
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.220]   I you know
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:58.060]   For a while steve kipson who was a very hardcore ketosis guy
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:06.780]   Told me that the p tests uh eventually become less reliable that we ultimately you have to do a blood
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.900]   Uh a finger prick to really know what your ketone level is
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.500]   The blowing the blowing ones the little keto flutes
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.780]   And the p tests your body adjusts and so you don't you don't see the ketones
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.620]   After a while, well you look at all of the people that are selling like uh
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.740]   Always on glucose mario. Yeah, I'm back. You're all right. Yeah. I have them
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.300]   And and i was like that's useful because i'm type 2 diabetic and that is useful right
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.300]   And i got a bit crazy, but you got weight lifters using it to try to
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:42.220]   You know performance increase their vanity. So what is so as as it's coming out
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.340]   Initially stacy, what is the u-scan?
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.060]   Test what does it do?
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.460]   It's testing for the the first few tests that they have out are going to be for the diet
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:58.300]   Which is the the ketones and pH and I think vitamin c is coming but is not there yet
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.580]   They say vitamin deficiencies. You know what would be good is d is a big one actually
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.140]   So there's I mean so huge vitamin c like crazy. So I don't know
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.100]   Well, that's good. Most of us get way too much
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:17.420]   I mean, let's put over vitamin c. Let's say no one's getting scurvy these days unless you're like a college freshman
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.100]   Who's only eating Doritos?
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.980]   So you chay if you change the cartridge in this it has you could change the test in other words what you test
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:30.300]   Yes, and then the other test is looking for it's it's female reproductive health is what they're calling it and
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:35.420]   So you could tell if you're pregnant tracking menstrual cycles you could you certainly could tell if you're pregnant
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:42.700]   I mean that's that's the only reason to get it. It's sort of when when you're through the oh when you're fertile because when you're ovulating. Yeah
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.580]   Oh, that's interesting. So you could do that. Oh
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.500]   Yeah, I think that's kind of that's kind of nice. Right?
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:57.500]   The app watched as something called retroactive ovulation, which strikes me as great a little too late
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.820]   Well, so
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.540]   Ovulation you can use body temperature sure your rhythm method and you
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:14.860]   Okay, the rhythm method is just tracking days. Oh, okay. I thought I also did add. I mean rhythm method is anything that is like
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.040]   Calent or not
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.240]   Occasionally yeah, tell me about it was the roulette
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.360]   That too many of us played in college. I can tell you right now
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.280]   I wouldn't be here if the rhythm method worked. Let's just put it that way
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.720]   But you you can track pretty granularly
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:38.560]   When you ovulate now, um and to to quite like to the day and sometimes even time of day. So that's useful
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.760]   Whether you're trying to get pregnant or not that's useful. I could see sure. Yeah
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.440]   with
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.040]   the urine
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:53.200]   Tracking hormones in your urine. I don't know how exact it is and they don't actually know because they don't have that they're not publishing that
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.880]   Data right now, but they're they're saying it's accurate enough that you can
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:04.960]   Track your fertility with that. This is the only one. Here's another one. This is uh, yes a yellow it's called yellow sis
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   uh
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.360]   Korean company was a Samsung incubator
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.360]   uh
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.320]   This is just like a p-stick on a on a thing that you
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.120]   Oh, I forget it. I don't even want to talk about this. It looks like my chlorine test strips. It does
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:25.920]   It looks exactly like a hot tub. Yeah, exactly like oh, oh hello. What is this the vvoo? It's a uh
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.800]   a toilet mounted hardware
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.040]   Oh god. I swear to god. Yes
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.280]   Why was this so hard to get the news? I'm sorry apple
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.280]   Is the news steps?
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.000]   Apple owns the the wearables basically it's apple and fitbit and then everybody else
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.600]   So they're finding some other area. Is that it? I I think it's no you can I mean you can't
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:55.360]   accurately test for new things using urine. Okay, that's true. That's true. So that's that's what these efforts are
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.080]   um different biomarkers
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.600]   and
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:07.360]   There is a lot of there is real interest in the medical space for your analysis. I think that makes it is FDA approved
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.720]   but none of these are that and that's really important to say because
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.160]   like even even from a FDA approval only a fib on your apple watch is approved. So everything else like
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:24.880]   Ox blood ox all that that's just that's marketing. Let's let's move on because I think we
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.320]   plumbed this subject uh sufficiently
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.720]   Um taking the piss out of it enough. Yes. Well, do you do you not want to know about the
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.960]   $19,000 smart toilet from kohler? Are you kidding me?
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.040]   Coalition this last year in the year before they've been showing this forever. This is the second generation
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   Oh, this time
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   It's real
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:51.120]   By the way should be the slogan for ces this time. It's real because most of the time
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.800]   It's not frankly. Oh, I looked at some of the concept cars and it's like it all land in tires
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.240]   It's crazy. So what so this is a big trend smart toilet for how much?
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.760]   $19,000 I believe it's 19,000. Oh first world problems or what?
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.680]   um
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:17.520]   Yeah, really to toilet, but so so here's the big trend that I thought was fun. Um, it's ceas not fun fun and just the
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:24.400]   It may be the whole bathroom suite was 19,000. Yeah, I'm sorry. The toilet is 11,000. Oh
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.040]   By the reasonable there
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   Okay, sorry. I I'm I'm really sorry. I believe the other stuff also like they have a whole suite
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:33.600]   Okay
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.520]   So this is this idea of smart things getting built into your home like into the home infrastructure
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:47.360]   I saw lots of people. This is less sexy, but everybody and their dog now has what like a fin or a water home monitoring and shut off thing
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.480]   Which actually is hugely valuable. Those are cool because they detect leaks without knowing where the leak is
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.160]   It's amazing how that was detect leaks. Yeah, I saw that a couple years ago
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.840]   Auto shut off what we saw at cs this year was tons of companies now offering it not to consumers but to home builders
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.400]   And so that's smart. Yep
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.520]   Smart, but it's also a little weird because you're like hey
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:17.920]   Um, if your builder is going to offer this, how do you get the app? How do you resell it? What is the what is the it's why would they spend the money on this?
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.440]   Because when if you go into a development these days
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.720]   This is how they compete the list of smart home features that we offer
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:32.800]   You know, that comes with a massive disadvantage though because when the companies that make those smart homes
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:41.040]   Uh smart home devices go bust. You're now left with an unsupported product. You know that I know that nobody knows they're better than stacey
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:47.680]   This is marketing. This is not yeah, it's complete. I agree with stacey. It's complete marketing bull
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.280]   I'm sorry
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.600]   There's a reason why a lot of a lot of techies don't have these devices in their homes
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.880]   Because they're fundamentally unsound and unsecured
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:03.040]   And it's unfortunate because a lot of these are quite like I actually my my fin water thing
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.360]   Fin is brilliant. I have it plugged in. Yeah
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.080]   Well, these are these are actually I the things here are actually easier because you don't have to install them yourself
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.120]   They already come with your house. So you have the app but you do have to connect it
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.360]   But when you like I don't know how long that's going to work right now
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.720]   I've had my fin for three years and two or three it might go out
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:27.520]   You know or like they might stop supporting it or the idea this thing is you put it on a pipe somewhere in the house and it could detect water leaks
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.280]   Anywhere in the house or water left on it's p h y n
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.120]   Dot com
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:39.360]   Yes, and alarm dot com was showing off. They have water dragon which I hear uses z wave long range which I can tell you about later
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   But no one will care. Um
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.120]   There was several startups with their own options there
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.280]   And then so also being built in the house
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:53.600]   I'll give you one sexy thing and then I'll give you one thing that is just crazy and we could talk about it. So my sexy thing is
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:36:00.080]   Energy management so Schneider showed off their whole energy management kit started with a smart breaker board
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:07.520]   An integrated battery an EV charger and it goes all the way down to their smart their wiser smart switches and uh
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.640]   So this is something a builder would want to install you wouldn't do this
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.720]   retrofit
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   I wouldn't so you will see
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:23.600]   So and there were tons of things like this. We've actually seen smart breaker boxes at cds and some other places in the last few years
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.000]   What's coming to a head is the it's a trifecta. It's climate change
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.240]   Causing us to need like resilience with like power outages and everything else
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:38.480]   Um, it is electrification. So as climate change worsens. We're all buying more electric and we're putting more
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.840]   We're requiring more amps employing more electricity from
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:49.440]   Things like that. Yeah, keep humps. Yes and EVs and whatever else. That's right. And then the unreliable
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.240]   Unreliability the non
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.760]   The dynamic dynamic system. This is why I don't do video. This is why I'm a writer
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:04.720]   The dynamic the dynamic nature of renewable energy means we're going to have to store and use the load
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.360]   At times when it's convenient for us even though the sun may not be shining or the wind blowing
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:15.360]   So all those three trends are coming together and what's happened and what has really hit the ground running this year
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.480]   Is we're seeing a lot of solutions to store the energy
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:25.840]   To manage the load either the breaker box or with sam songs talking about their smart things like energy AI platform
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:33.680]   And we also saw um the home connectivity alliance, which is a group of appliance companies getting together to pitch ways to
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.400]   Interoperate in the cloud
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.560]   Like have your washing machine
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.720]   Talk to your water pump and then be able to control
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:48.640]   For a utility to control all of the washing machines or dryers out there to lower their temperature during
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:55.840]   Interesting. Wow. Yes. So yeah, that's a really big cool trip like you can get home and you're closer wet and they say yeah
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   We turned down your dryer for you
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.640]   The idea is to right
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.880]   To to the grid yeah
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:08.560]   But also if your appliances are smart enough and this is where I do think smart thing
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.600]   It's like smart home stuff does come into play. It's not as sexy as like colorless lights
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.720]   But it's important is I can say hey look
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.640]   You can always turn my thermostat down by this amount
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:26.720]   Um, I will delay drying my clothes. Yeah, I will put my fridge in eco mode because I don't care
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:32.080]   Um, but I've got a dead body in my outside freezer. So I need that to stay as cold as possible. So don't
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.800]   Yeah, and then
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   You know what's funny is
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.960]   We're missing some we're missing some parts of the tech though. Um, again
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:47.760]   Sorry, I just came back. So it's fresh in my head since I was in school in Japan back in 2006
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.800]   They've had washer dryers that are a single unit
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:57.760]   Great. So you put everything in there and it will when it's ready to turn on it will fill up
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.720]   Put laundry detergent in it wash the clothes and dry the clothes in a single unit
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:08.400]   We still don't have those very prominently here in the us, but those are prime for let
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.400]   Me just throw this load in and when the grid says okay, the price has gone down
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.840]   And the heavy usage in my neighborhood is chilled out
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.840]   It would turn on do it staying while you're sleeping and when you wake up everything's done
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:28.160]   So we're getting part of that which is monitor the grid use the grid when it's optimal
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.160]   But we still don't have the convenience of like a single box that can do everything
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:37.200]   And it's funny to me because I know it exists. I've used them. They work fantastically
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.160]   Very common in Europe. Yeah, very common Europe
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.040]   We I think Japan and in in uk work had an end together for a lot of things
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.400]   And so yeah, it's just one of those things that here in the us we still don't have
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.400]   We don't have it because we want massive washers and dryers
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:58.880]   And like like anytime I'm in Europe or when I was in Japan. I was like, oh, how quick these people
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   You would
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.760]   Like what these people don't have 4500 square feet
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.960]   A sock today and then I'll do the other sock tomorrow
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.680]   And the the thing too, they don't use as much water, right? I know
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:23.120]   That is that is that is what's okay. I got a car
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.440]   Chat real quick. Yeah, the chat is saying we have larger families bs
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.240]   And we have different types of clothes bs. I'm gonna just call that unless you've been there
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.640]   Please don't say stuff like that. We just have to get used to it
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.400]   But you know what's forcing it economics are forcing it because power is getting more expensive waters getting scarcer
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.760]   Uh, you know, we're gonna have to face it the Japanese have lived in an environment where they're very tightly
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.520]   Uh
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.400]   Packed and and the resources are strange. So they you know, they've really been able
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.360]   They've been smart about using resources. Well, we're soon gonna be we've had a lot of room for a long time
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.200]   We're soon gonna be facing these kinds of economic restraints anyway
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.240]   And that's that's good. That's why there is
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.600]   That's why there's all this stuff. I would guess stacey. What about matter was matter there did matter matter
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.760]   Did it matter matter matter matter matter is gonna matter, but first i'm gonna tell you one more thing
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.840]   Yes, uh about being built into your house. Yes, this is the masonite door with power
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.880]   With the integrated doorbell. No, no, no, no, no, no, okay. Hold on. Hold on
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.720]   I just mentioned arguments coming up. We'll see how much first of all the smart door the m power door
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.880]   Okay, it's $6,500 for the m power door
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.760]   And what does it do stacey?
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.240]   It has
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.200]   The here's the door you have to charge ladies and gentlemen. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.800]   You don't charge it
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:51.680]   It is a door actually I took a video of this door if you I can there's an integrated power cord that's built in
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.640]   So it's pulling power again. This is something to your home. So you do have to have a a door
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.720]   Jant whenever you call that opening that's near a plug, but somehow or you
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:09.120]   It's it's a ran it's when you build the home. It's let me I'll show this is not for aftermarket
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.760]   This is for a new if you renovate it or rent it your house will have power there
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.240]   Um here. Oh, but it put it in the same place that you put the other one and i'll
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.880]   I'll click it. I share. Oh wait, you don't have to show it just be
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.920]   On off last night then how does it work if the power doesn't on go as a battery in it?
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:34.160]   So it has a battery in it for a while, but then then you're stuck you have to stay inside or outside depending on where you were
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.320]   Not stuck. Okay. What happens?
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.760]   It has integrated lights
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.640]   Um, it's got a doorbell right all of that stuff right? It's got it. It's got an integrated doorbell
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.760]   It's got a connected lock now the lock will still open if your power is out
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.360]   All you need is like a little nine volt battery. It'll start though
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.480]   So you carry that with you at all times a little nine volt battery
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.600]   Most people like I don't know about you, but apparently kevin keeps a nine volt battery somewhere
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:06.720]   Secreted around his house. What's the key under the door jane? How is carrying a nine volt battery?
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:11.120]   Of a problem that carried a key. I mean go the old fashioned, but you know
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:17.760]   I'm gonna put a strong lock on the door and it seems to work pretty well. Yeah, you don't you don't carry it
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.440]   You put it on the mat. I've got a nine volt under the mat
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.520]   Or maybe you know something fake rock people
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:31.360]   I'll go as one of this because the the sludge gives me well enough warning or slagé if we want to be fancy
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.800]   Gives me well enough warning before the batteries are going to die and you can also hear when it closes
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.760]   when he goes
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   You're like, okay time to change the battery
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:48.640]   But I always wondered like couldn't we have it where you can just stick your phone somewhere and plug it in
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.400]   No data, but just let your phone power it in an emergency
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.280]   Right if you would carry a nine volt battery. Yes. You wouldn't have this problem
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.840]   Just carry but your phone your phone is in your pocket the nine volt. That's the truth story
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.200]   Right like I got my phone. I got my why this is
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.320]   Photoid. Oh good. These empower smart doors. It says mason. I says they're coming soon to the home depot
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.880]   Home depot. Yes, and this is a replacement front door. You can get it in different colors
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.600]   You can get it in different light or different window things
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:25.360]   What so you so that is the power cord going from your house to the door and the door is actually very nice
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.280]   So someone who's recently bought a front door. It's a fiberglass. Sure. Okay
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.240]   Yeah, it's a fiberglass door
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.880]   I I did not show you the there's there's plenty of pictures on the internet of the actual door
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.960]   Yeah, we get the idea so it is
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.720]   Lighting is nice. Yeah, it's got lights. So like when somebody leaves a package. It lights up
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.840]   It has a welcome led welcome
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:54.080]   It's got lights all along the the top the bottle. It's got a ring door bill built in so I guess
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:45:01.360]   Here's my issue. Yeah, I hate the fact that it's got the ring stuff built in and I hate the fact that there isn't a size standard like an
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.240]   Is it not? I want to say an OSHA standard but like a building standard for
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:11.840]   The size of like your connected doorbell because then you could slot any doorbell in there
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.200]   Like I hate the fact that you've got doors with holes in them that in
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.400]   I mean, I haven't had a doorbell that lasts more than four years
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.960]   Yeah, I just kind of glue mine onto the door jammer around the door like a normal
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.160]   Human I don't doesn't have to be built in although the smart lock does right they show it with a Yale
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.720]   But it says shown with the ale and which sounds like you could put other smart locks in there
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   Is that a standard you can that's not a standard yet either. Oh wow
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:42.080]   It's shown with the ale you can choose other doors. I think they manufacture it though with other locks
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.560]   Like it has a door state sensor. So if you're one of those people said, did I close the door?
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.120]   You can see if it's closed
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.080]   It's a nice idea
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.520]   I think it's a nice idea for like I think there's like in an apartment complex that this might be sure
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.080]   kind of compelling
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:07.680]   I know that they're designed for the home, but I feel like it's just a little too soon and this is where matter comes in and
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.520]   the
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.400]   We don't have enough standards yet both on the physical side
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   And we don't have enough laws to protect us on the the digital side for keeping the stuff in and we don't have
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.080]   Interoperability between all of our systems yet for everything
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.800]   So it's too soon to start building this stuff into our homes
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.480]   You can see though how there might be pressure from these builders
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:35.360]   Uh to start standardizing so that they could do this. I mean I thought yeah, I see where that's coming from. Yeah
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.880]   Not so much consumers. I think consumers have just thrown up their hands. It's a tower of babble
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.680]   It's it's always going to have some extra hub and
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.480]   Something's not going to talk to something else. I give up is matter going to change that that's really was the
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:54.560]   The hub thing is pretty incredible because I saw a couple of cool hubs. I think one was might have been Samsung
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.040]   They see you'll be able to fill this in the new smart station. Yeah, the smart station
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:05.600]   That's what it was any it started to like be a translator if you will going back to the house of babble situation. Yeah
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:12.160]   That's what you need. That's what matter is matter is designed to be a translator between certain devices
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:17.120]   So they will translate between apples ecosystem google so any ecosystem basically is
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.360]   So if you have and samsung is a member of matter and these smart things
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:28.400]   Station, is that a matter device? Is that how it works? It is a matter. Yes, it does not exist yet
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.440]   That works because you know
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:38.640]   We're gonna have to deal with this interoperability problem for so many years to come and anything that can fix that is welcome
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.720]   That's the whole point of matter, right?
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.520]   People have been dealing with the last time you were on tWIG
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:48.880]   Smatter hubs. Yeah, the last time you went to a queue said matter is maybe not a high enough level solution
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.600]   To solve that that it's more of a lower level solution
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.040]   Is a lower level solution. Yeah, yes
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.920]   Um, it is it is good for some things
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.760]   Your light bulbs are gonna like you could buy any light bulb any matter light bulb is gonna work with any matter system
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.160]   And that's not gonna be a problem for you, right?
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.680]   But where it starts getting weird is oh, okay. Well, cool
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.160]   I can tell madam a to turn off my lights
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:19.520]   But if you wanted to like set up some cool like light bulb thing where like when I enter a room and this motion detector senses me turn out of the lights
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.400]   You're still gonna have to program that and that's where
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.640]   People are gonna be like, oh, I thought matter. Who's gonna solve all this, but it's really good
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.960]   You know who had a really cool one and i'm going to mowin
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.240]   You know like the faucet people faucet folks
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:40.000]   They have a sensor that says when I walk into the room and sit down in my reading chair
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.280]   Which I have in my bedroom turn on my reading light
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:52.240]   Unless I roll into the room at 10 30 and Karen's already asleep is like not gonna turn light on your water faucet turns on your light
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.760]   No, no, no, they made a little sensor that you put in your room. Oh, okay
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.800]   It's as weird that it's made by mowin. That's the only part that threw me off
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.200]   I had to double check the same because I was like
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.200]   From Austin left behind all of her fancy faucets, right? Stacy
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.840]   I did I replaced my fancy faucets. Oh, this is this is just standalone sensor
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.160]   It's a really cool sensor because again
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:18.400]   Like I love the fact that if I walk into my bedroom and I said it I have this, you know, Sherlock Holmes tear in my bedroom
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:23.840]   That I don't know where we got it from, but it's amazing and it's like old victorian chair. I love this tear
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.240]   So when you sit in it, it's a big high back with the wings on the side and like
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.040]   For it to automatically turn on my apple tv and turn on the little lamp that's right next to it
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.800]   So I can sit down and watch my shows and not pay attention and do stuff on my iPad
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.000]   perfect
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.840]   But if it did that every time I walked in the room and she's already asleep. Yo, I'm gonna get cursed out
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.600]   Hit with something
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.080]   Whatever so this thing is smart enough to know that someone's sleeping
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:57.440]   And it'll do the other thing is smart enough to know is that if someone moves but it's not a big enough move to turn on the
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:05.040]   The panic light it won't turn it on so it won't get tricked by breathing or the cat walking in stuff according to sure that's
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.120]   the mowin
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.560]   Sensor I think that's what it was the mowin smart sensor you went there
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:17.280]   Well, no because I I don't recall seeing it and I'm looking for it. I I this exists
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.680]   I think it was what you're describing
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   Exists. I just didn't I'm like really mowin did it
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.920]   But it's just weird that it came from the faucet company. That's the part that threw me off
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:36.320]   I think well, that's what's throwing me off too. So mowin was there according to stacey on iot with new sprinkle air and soil soil sensors
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.480]   Maybe that's what you're confusing with
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.200]   Well, yeah, they totally had that it
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.600]   Bless their hearts. They were just totally like I was like, hey is this soil sensor?
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.440]   That's pretty cool. We'll work with my other stuff and they're like no. We're using a proprietary system. Oh god
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.440]   Have we learned maybe I was wrong. I gotta find out who made it
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:57.920]   But it was really cool because those those kind of things would come in really handy
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:04.400]   Right now the sensors are too sensitive my kitchen one drives me crazy like it comes on for no reason. Yeah
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.960]   So nana they've actually offers they launched
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:16.080]   This is not here's a good example of where matter is not gonna go. It was far nana leafed launch something called sense
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.920]   Plus controls and it is a light switch that's wired or unwired. It's gonna be out. I think
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.240]   Well, I'll just say later next year. I think it's a third quarter of next year. They have an odd
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.320]   slogan the only buttons not meant to be pushed
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:37.040]   Yeah, so that is exact what he's talking about what doc rak is talking about is exactly what they're trying to do
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   They created something called nala. It is the nana leaf automated learning. No
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.800]   nana leaf AI learning automations or something. Anyway, the point is it's
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:55.760]   They're basically applying smart rules to their lights and eventually possibly other lights that you're gonna bring in to that nana leaf
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:01.520]   So I know the nana leaf that you introduced it to us because they make those things on the wall that do the shapes and all that
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.880]   This but they're in growth. They're now doing is this new for them or where they always doing this and we just never
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:13.520]   This is new. This is more a new from CES is the and they're doing this because now they have the bandwidth
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:20.160]   So I had the CEO of nana leaf on the podcast jimmy chew and he was like, yeah, we couldn't we were spending so much time, you know
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:27.520]   Modifying for apple modifying for yeah, okay. Well, and now now we can actually do this which is pretty cool here
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.000]   I'll show you the cool thing. This is from I have your picture from your blog
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.880]   With the sense plus. Oh here. I took yeah. Oh, yeah, that's there, but this is there new. This is just fun
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.800]   So that's a new fun
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.160]   They're trying to bring color into everyday lighting in your house and this is their ceiling option
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:52.880]   Which was so cool. Are you did you you're doing something? Are you putting a link in to the I put the link?
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   I just I'm just swapping out links left and right. Oh, this is kind of so this is that gone back to that geometry thing
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.440]   So that ceiling that's that's a new ceiling is what they're trying to show you
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.440]   And if you can shrink those down you could get some quite high resolution stuff
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.560]   I mean who wouldn't want to go to sleep with the eye of Sauron going over the
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:17.360]   Well, so that's one of the things and this is this is big picture, but and I'm kind of
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.880]   Having had nano leafs in my life for a long time
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:28.320]   He's hey, look. We're gonna the next step in lighting is color because it's it's cheap. It's easy, right?
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:35.680]   He's done that since they got out. That's what he was doing. He has always had the one problem of
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.360]   And it's gonna sound crazy. They're really bad design
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:43.440]   And so what happens is they're light bulbs when they spit fall off out
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:48.800]   The fall off is just odd and that matters in light like how it shapes and how the light looks
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.120]   Where it hits the wall and things like that
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.440]   Their bulb shape is just odd
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:54:00.400]   So it calls for bad lighting patterns and their white lights have always been so yellow. Yeah, I'm sorry
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.680]   I have that light
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:08.400]   Those are all the little the little can the little can spotlight
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.560]   I have like a dozen of them and I I love them
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.880]   And then I got somebody gave me a life as bulb thinking they were doing me a favor
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.160]   And I'm like oh the shape of this is automatically makes for better light and it's not as yellow
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.000]   And I just not even know this although because I've probably had good
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.040]   Yeah, I have I have like over 60 of them
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:34.640]   The product is is basically flawless except where their design is bad and as soon as you notice something else
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.880]   You know the difference it goes back to that. It's interesting
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:41.520]   Once you had a five wagyu steak you realize that the ribeye from root Chris is a joke
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:46.880]   Yes, I would agree with you or or the sushi in Japan versus the sushi in sloth florida
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:51.280]   Is that how you get this purple background behind you? Uh, doc rock is the yes
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:57.280]   I'm using, um, nanolights no use actually bad for video people because they they look at it first
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:01.760]   The minute that you use you lose a sync timing. They will flicker like
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.480]   So
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.600]   All video lights including that fake light bulb right there
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.760]   It's an actual professional video light because they they're designed to sync with your
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:15.920]   Learning so much here
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.320]   so on the
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.400]   the total
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.320]   Some of it all stacy do you feel like?
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:28.560]   I've gone many years in thinking home automation is not getting simpler. It's not getting easier
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.720]   It's not it's getting crazier. Do you feel like we're starting to make progress?
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:39.920]   No, I think we're still over complicating it no
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.360]   There we're we're taking small steps in some areas and not doing things
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.480]   in others so
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:55.280]   I think we see a lot of good ideas. I think there's some really important things like the energy management is really important
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.360]   Right. I think that's gonna actually yes
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.160]   Affect things and we're gonna do some really good stuff. I think matter will help bring
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.720]   You know a lot of smart home stuff to more people that want it
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:12.480]   Um, I don't think there's a really compelling reason still for a lot of people to want this because there's not
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.880]   Other than like using your voice to turn on your lights like who cares
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.960]   but if you can have things like
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.920]   The smarter stuff that doc rocks talking like what nana leaves was talking about then it becomes
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:32.160]   Much more compelling. It's it's not much different than the clap on clap off basic
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.240]   There
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.480]   You did a great podcast with the whole exact you did a great podcast with kevin toful
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:45.600]   Uh, of course the stacy on iot website has it stacy on iot.com
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.040]   Their iot podcast is great you and kevin were at ces together
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:56.960]   So you have all that coverage and as you mentioned you have the uh, nana leaf guy on jimmy chew or guy or gal guy
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:03.840]   Jim jimmy is guy. Yes. Um, and so this is definitely worth listening to uh, if you want to know more about this
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:11.680]   We did talk earlier today with sam and bull sam about cars at ces there were a lot of interesting things including that new honda sony
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:18.880]   Operation called the afela which has a built-in place station five worst brand name
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:24.960]   I don't even know about that thing if you're interested in that sam talked for
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:30.480]   About 20 minutes with us on ask the tech guys our first episode that's that twit.tv/atg
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.280]   Father robert also had a very nice cut down where he showed like 800 products at five minutes
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   Uh, that was on the ask the tech guys show as well and robert will be on next week
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:44.800]   To talk more he kind of I think ended up seeing a lot more uh kind of goofy stuff
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.920]   than you did uh
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:53.680]   I bypass the guy I had limited time because I was sick for a full day. So I was like goofy skip it
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.680]   I got no time for goofy. Yeah
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:59.360]   Do you on on balance you think ces was worth it this year you're glad you went
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.920]   I mean, I liked seeing kevin
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:11.120]   Getting out of the house. That's that's what it mostly was here. Basically the rationale for ces is I get to see my friends
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:17.600]   It's fun. It's a social bobby con is to say is the main reason why we go to these things. So yeah
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:21.920]   Lobby con the where we meet in the lobby. Yeah. Yeah, yeah lobby con. I love that
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:27.520]   Did you see the ge profile mixer because that thing had me so I was just about to bring that up
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:33.120]   That's all I would want to ask you this entire time we would know about that as well. Yeah, Leo wouldn't let me
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:39.680]   I have a house full of GE profile crap that breaks more than any of the stuff ever I've ever had
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:48.240]   But okay, tell me american tell me about the GE profile smart mixer with auto sense the smartest mixer in america
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:54.080]   This is this isn't this is a thousand dollar mixer. I'm just gonna tell everybody so you can get
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.320]   So I have a very nice kitchen aid that has lasted 40 freaking
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:03.360]   Yes 30 years old, but it was 500 bucks 500 books 30 years
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:09.040]   But worth it but worth it because it never broke. This looks like it's not gonna last is it gonna last as long
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.080]   We'll see
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.480]   I would replace my kitchen aid if it didn't better
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.760]   What does it do better? Yeah, I don't know the math, Leo
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:21.760]   But if I think about it seriously 30 years ago when we paid 5600 bucks for that
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:26.880]   Equals more than a thousand dollars now, but it lasts too. That's the point. It is definitely last
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.240]   You know, this thing is gonna break down if I be exact
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.600]   Okay, go ahead
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:38.160]   No, I I'm like so I mean, yeah, we have a it's not out yet. So we don't know
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   You saw it you can buy it from kratenborough and I saw it and I saw it in action and they they also offer backwards
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.440]   All they're showing is it it's a doe hook mixing cookie dough
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.800]   Which is great for you stacy, but does it do anything else?
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.400]   It does it does everything your mixer would do
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:59.600]   The thing it's using that makes it interesting and this is actually this is just the reason why
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.640]   We spent 1500 on the june oven
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.320]   Right smart in the sense that it lets you become an expert
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:12.400]   It starts augment you okay, so it has a scale you throw in your degrees. It also uses
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.520]   It's built an algorithm. This basically checking torque on the motor and based on that
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   It's understanding if your dough is needed or if your
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.600]   Rang is your end-winder. So you can say
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.160]   Your meringue is morong
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.720]   Well, for instance, it's very easy to go from whipped cream cream to whipped cream to butter
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.000]   If it would say it's whipped cream. Do you want butter? No, it stops. It stops. That's good
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.960]   Okay, these are gonna be banned from British Bake Off because that would completely skew the competition
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.880]   And then you have the smart oven that told you when your sponge is exactly right. I do like this
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.200]   I do want fun out of it. No, I do like that
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.720]   I have to say the thermomics has a scale in it my june oven has a scale in it those things
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.560]   Really making it. I'm not gonna say having a scale in those look is a really good idea
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.160]   Well, yeah, because baking is science according to autumn browning, you know
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.440]   It is and you know, american bakers really like to put cups of flour in and everywhere else in the world they measure it by
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.280]   Starting on your yeah, I've been cooking over christmas
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.880]   I went on extended rant with my family about the use of cups the use of ounces
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.520]   Your ridiculous use of fluid ounces over here go metric please
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.080]   That ruins recipes
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:37.760]   Uh, it is tablespoons and teaspoons because unless you use one that is quote-unquote measured to the amount
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.840]   It's wrong and if you're doing a tablespoon of a dry ingredient
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.880]   You're just guessing right because nobody takes the thing and does that perfect
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.480]   Perfect holidays every time but I mean, but it's no one good
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.560]   I want this you've got the same problem with cups in that you know a cup of sliced mushrooms
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.400]   Well, how do we slice the mushrooms? We do them broad. We mince them down
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:04.400]   The geeks who turned into this show for technology are really yeah, we're really much
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.000]   And geeks gotta eat to eat
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.240]   Geeks gotta eat up
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.800]   Okay, so he stays he yeah, you kind of maybe if convinced me much the same way you convinced me to buy a
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.200]   15-tonne dollar toaster. Well, hold on hold on before you go out and do this yes some things to know yes
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:29.680]   You will build up the experience over time and baking in a way. I don't think you do that's true
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.280]   That's true because you're physically touching and seeing these things. Yeah, yeah, so it is a lot to pay
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.280]   to like for those first few classes if that makes sense like I think it's a really
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.960]   Yeah, because I could get it right now. I don't need I never make butter
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:50.320]   I always put the right amount of flour in my breads and all that thing that they added though that
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.440]   I don't know if it's worth that much money, but it's worth a lot
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.920]   We have you ever changed the hook on your kitchen a mid-
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.720]   That thing is a pain in the butt the fact that they have a
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:09.760]   Release that's that's really a lot. Okay, but you know what they don't have the other thing is when your hand is jacked up
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.440]   Because I'm doing something with the meat now and I need to do something with the mixer
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.520]   I could just lean back and be like okay. Can you mix that out slow for a blah blah blah?
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.960]   And that is true
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.880]   That's also good because when you're in the you're cooking by yourself in the smaller kitchen
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.080]   It's a pain in the butt. You got to stop what you're doing. Watch your hands
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.760]   Let me ask this because I am very reliant on the accessory
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:36.320]   Thing on my kitchen aid. I use it to make pasta. I use it to spiralize. Yeah, you're not gonna have that yet
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:42.640]   I lose they don't have that yet. Okay. It looks like they've got something in the front where it says profile that you could maybe release and stick in there
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.720]   But they don't have that I think that's the plan. They don't have those
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:53.360]   For and that's one of the great things about the kitchen aid you my mom made yeah share a meat grinder that she would attach to her kitchen
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.440]   Remember the kitchen aid
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.200]   What was that the snow cone maker? Yeah? Oh, yes, yeah, I chose one of my picks. Oh, yeah, we still use that
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.880]   I mean, dude. Yeah, it's like
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.880]   Okay, I have an entire appliance to make snow cones, but when you need it
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.920]   Do they have a shave on the guy who why that's hilarious?
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.880]   Go down the street
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.520]   Shave ice those
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:24.160]   Here's the Seattle that no nor in san francisco that gee says watch the gee
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.360]   Smart mixer whip it whip it good
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:34.400]   So we're gonna here it goes. It's whipping see to me. This is a mixer. It's gonna be a little you got okay
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:41.040]   You go you gotta you gotta do a little more than just have a scale in the feet and sensing how much
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.160]   I think but like so the june oven started at 1500 now it's 500
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.160]   You're right this can start at a thousand get down to five at 500 dollars
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.520]   I would 100 everything in my house from my front door to my toilet to my mixer gonna require a separate app
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.120]   That's where we're headed. Yes. That is where we're headed. That part is crazy
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.240]   This is true the too many apps part of it is insane
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.320]   And I I agree with Stacy
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.080]   I think right now it's a good start and they have to start somewhere
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.760]   And they have to start and have the companies that do this stuff have to be willing to be a joke
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.760]   Yes, everybody's humor for like, yes two to three years
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.440]   And then they go back and go look who's laughing and if you don't believe me iphone. Yeah. Yeah
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.160]   It sounded like is it like a luddite on this?
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.200]   But I do think there is you've raised a very serious point in that
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:39.280]   At what point does the convenience of these devices get lost in the amount of updating and upkeeping and cross platform support that you need to do to actually run them?
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.960]   I suspect people are going to basically pick the devices they want
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:47.360]   Just stick with those and a lot of these are going to get left, you know in in the garbage
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.920]   Well, they will and I will tell you I've got
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.200]   I mean, I buy the stupidest like I have a smart I have a GE cafe up in that is smart
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.800]   And I bought a smart pan that actually teaches us how to cook but the the pan
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:06.320]   I will not use it because it is a lot of maintenance my husband still uses it because and I also know how to cook
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.560]   so i'm like, but
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:15.680]   What I think will happen is the most successful devices you won't need the app for and like with the june oven even with this GE
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.320]   Apps that you can you're right, but you don't actually have to use that. No, I don't so
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.440]   That's where I think we'll see more value
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.600]   A lot of that and there is value in downloading the app
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.280]   You know setting it up so you can talk to it like voice is great in the kitchen
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.440]   I tell my oven to preheat, you know if I told my mixer to like, you know
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.720]   I love it that you used to be able to go to your faucet say give me a cup of water and it would do exactly
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.320]   Yeah, that was pretty cool
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:47.120]   Those those are things that are really like compelling. Yeah, and once you set those up
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.560]   They tend to work for quite some time. I mean, yes
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.040]   And you get used to them and you will keep them
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.920]   But so I think
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:01.440]   People will add them ad hoc, which is why interoperability is so important and if it's useful they'll keep using it otherwise
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.560]   Right the first time it falls off like my dryer fall fell offline like
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:11.200]   After the second or third time I dryer fell offline. I was like why I don't care
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:16.240]   Yeah, you know, I'm not connecting it again. Yeah, I mean there was there was some interesting stuff in terms of
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.000]   You know sort of
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.280]   Interoperable standards got I saw the new qe qe qe
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:21.840]   Chii
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.840]   Two standards coming out on what on wireless charging with apple backing it
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.720]   Which is really ironic considering that apple booked that standard on its own devices for so many years
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:38.400]   But you know it's that they the industry has got together and said look no point having two competing standards for wireless charging
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.320]   And now apple of all people is on board. That was really encouraging
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.520]   Yeah, I mean that's that's what's happened with matter. That's it'll keep happening
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.000]   We're just in the early days and we want things to move
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.040]   We spent the early days for 20 freaking years
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:08:00.480]   Think about how long electrification took this is not like smartphone adoption. This is like electrification
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.000]   It's true. This makes sense. All right. Let's take a little break
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.680]   Uh, I think that's it for CES. Yes, anything last chance. Do you want to talk about the bird buddy?
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.000]   Smart hummingbird feeder that kind of have five 350 different species of honeymoon birds
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.880]   Going going you want to talk the birds
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:22.720]   You want to talk about the smart pen the newa that has four
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:27.680]   Three cameras in it and we'll record what you're writing and then turn it into
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.400]   I don't know what a picture
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:36.880]   Do you want to do I do miss a couple of years ago when they had these smart hair brush and we ran the main attraction headline but no it's
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.160]   Did you see the 3d printed skin gummies where you take a picture and they use this quote?
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.120]   I'm quote AI to analyze your skin issues and then it
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:52.480]   3d it's like neutragenus making these then at 3d prints vitamins. Oh, that's cool. Rafe on demand. It is not cool leo
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.240]   That is stupid. It is a waste of money. It's molly. I'm sorry
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.040]   wasn't there also
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.360]   At least one maybe more devices that smelled
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.720]   Did you see these?
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:10.720]   There was a lot of smelling. This is uh, this is the aroma shooter
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.600]   This is the aroma shooter
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.560]   Uh, which this is a hell of a pc funding for this rivish
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.440]   I mean there are people starving in the world for goodness sake
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:28.000]   Solid state cartridges in a variety of flavors papaya chamomile and soy sauce
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:34.640]   And then it it it it it has of course an app the aroma player
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.600]   that that shoots smells
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.560]   Into the air
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:45.200]   You want to see a video? By the way, thanks. I got I get a lot of credit to katie wickens
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.600]   At uh at pc gamer who went around and found all the stupidest
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.760]   Stuff at ces this is the aroma shooter
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.160]   and the aroma
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.000]   player
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   The official nsfw trailer
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   Yeah, I was going to say do you want to show an sf? Maybe I don't want to show that
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.240]   I don't know what is going on. Yeah
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.360]   All right, let's stop it right now before it's killing it with fly. Oh see it see look. It's like a mixer
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.080]   Like uh like logic
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.720]   Only instead of mixing music you're mixing aromas
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.640]   So you've got orange dark chocolate peppermint floral soap perfume in natural forest
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.440]   And then while you're watching your video
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.840]   the aroma shooter
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.960]   Which looks like I hate to say it looks like it goes on your head
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.160]   And shoots at your nose
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.320]   Will shoot these smells at you as you're watching the video
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.680]   Am I am I actually sounds incredibly annoying?
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:49.760]   Yes, that's what happens and then you saw like mowin launched a k-cup kind of thing for or was it it may have been um
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.240]   Cooler. I can't remember it was mowin or color. I think it's cooler actually
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.760]   Colors doing k-cups aromatherapy k-cups for your showers
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:05.040]   Nido robotics is doing aromatherapy things that you stick in your vacuum cleaners. So when you're Roomba
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.440]   It's not your is your neato vacuums running around. It's
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:15.680]   People apparently feel like they smell bad and their world smells bad because that was definitely a theme
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.200]   We saw it see yes, they're funny
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:23.120]   You know deodorants only about 100 years old, you know, it was it was invented and they was just like let's find a market for this
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.000]   So they went up to women and they went up to men and now we're all wearing deodorant and it's just
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.600]   This wasn't an issue. I remember what the world smelled like 100 years ago. I'm okay with deodorant
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.880]   I lived in Texas for like 40 years. Deodorant is really important
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.640]   Just living in a bay man
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.960]   The amount of people that thought patuli was an excellent like cover of
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:51.600]   Yeah, I was like no man patuli is fine by itself, but patuli and funk not fair
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.880]   No, it's like when you come in someone's house and incenses everywhere and it's just like I get you like the smell
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:04.080]   But not all the time. It's why is it that if I see a guy with dreadlocks. I almost am sure they're gonna smell like patuli
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.080]   Why is that?
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.880]   What is that all about if they're wearing that poncho too? It's 100% gonna happen
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.000]   By the way that was me in high school. I'm just gonna say
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.560]   But I didn't know it any better
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.000]   Then I found close I got a seat at life changed. Yeah, you don't know
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.560]   Let's take a little break. We've got lots more non-ceus material
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:31.120]   With our wonderful panels great to this is a good way to begin the new year. I think
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.480]   Uh our first official show of the new year. I hope you enjoyed the best of in the holiday episode
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.880]   We've done for the last two weeks
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.800]   Uh, but it's good to get back in the saddle doc rock is here. He cam
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.880]   at
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.920]   Ambassador extraordinaire community manager there at doc rock great to see you
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.800]   Ian Thompson from the register always a pleasure Ian at Ian Thompson was fun
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.080]   We were debating whether he and should come up or not and I think
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.800]   after the last night's
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.160]   Uh, it was either a bowling alley or a war zone
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:12.240]   But I don't know was it like that in san francisco. It was we had lightning. Oh, I I posted a photo on uh posted a video on twitter
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.880]   I mean in retrospect looking at the forecast probably not a good idea. I'm glad you. Yes coming back down
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:24.000]   It's gonna be pretty brutal on the freeway. Yeah, california drivers do not know how to drive in the rain
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.960]   it never rains, but it pours here's eons of
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.280]   video from uh
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.000]   A rainy day a rainy night in san francisco was a full moon
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.560]   But you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to tell and then we wake up
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:40.480]   This morning to a crystal clear blue sky and that full moon. Yeah, just hanging there. So
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:45.600]   But it was crazy. We we had I mean I I did not sleep well last night because it was
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.800]   It was like we don't get thunder and lightning here either you get it north carolina, right?
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:54.000]   You're you're used to it's like texas. It was like texas
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.600]   It was like summer in texas or summer in kakalaki
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.560]   Uh, but we don't we're not used to that here and it's winter. There's a lot of trees down in on the neighborhood
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:06.480]   At the moment. I'm a member of the local cert team and we've been getting alerts all day
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.240]   Oh, uh, sorry
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:14.160]   So as in community emergency response not the computer one but yeah, um nice. Yeah, good for you
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.000]   It's good. You do that
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.640]   Uh also here stacey higginbotham from beautiful the beautiful pacific northwest
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.720]   Where uh you have a drought up there too. I hope you get some rain
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.000]   Uh, it's raining right now
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.840]   It's raining for the next week. It looks nice and green when we set it up your way
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.200]   Our show today brought to you by i'm happy to say our great friends at express vpn when lisa and I
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:44.080]   Were in mexico this past week. We really wanted to watch thursday night football on uh on amazon
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.880]   And uh, and I said oh
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.600]   I know what to do
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.600]   Express vpn fired that sucker up. I said I think we're in miami tonight
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.160]   We were able to watch the football game
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:03.840]   Express vpn is the best vpn service out there for a number of reasons first of all
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:10.080]   They are absolutely pure as the driven snow. They do not collect they do not log
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.680]   They do not collect any information about you and they go the extra mile to make sure your privacy is 100
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.800]   Percent they use a custom debbie and distribution and all their servers all over the world
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.400]   That refreshes itself every day wipes the drive and starts over
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.320]   When you go to an express vpn server when we went to that server in miami
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:35.840]   Press the connect button on the express vpn app. It's spun up in a entirely new instance of their trusted server software it runs in ram
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.320]   And it is completely
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.160]   Isolated from the rest of the system. It's it's uh
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:48.000]   Firewalled off so that it cannot write to the disc it's sandboxed so it cannot write to the disc
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.160]   Uh
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.880]   And then when you're done you close the express vpn
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.920]   And poof it's gone and there's no trace
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.360]   Of your presence now that's what you need in the vpn server virtual private network
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.560]   They do three things one of course they improve your security on open wifi
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.640]   Actually, we kept express vpn open the whole time at the hotel because we were on hotel wifi
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:14.320]   But I knew I felt secure and the nice thing about leaving express vpn on is they invest in their servers
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.920]   They invest in their bandwidth so they you never feel like you're sluggish or slow. We're able to watch hd video
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.840]   Just fine
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:27.280]   And and and you do it also to protect your privacy because even your internet service provider
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.240]   Is collecting data and selling it on to data brokers?
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:35.760]   Those data brokers are one of the most vile things that has happened in this internet era
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:41.600]   They collect information about you from all sorts of sources or browsing history your online searches
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.840]   Your location data then sell it off
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.240]   to to the highest bidder
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.600]   uh
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:54.320]   Which includes by the way the u.s. Government the department of homeland security and we've just learned the irs as well
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.080]   Its privacy is important to you if security is important to you and if you'd like to watch
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:06.640]   A football game in another country or another jurisdiction express vpn
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.120]   Express vpn and hide your ip address you're using their ip address
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:16.800]   That's another reason you want to use express vpn they invest in their i their infrastructure and they rotate their ip addresses
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.200]   So people who don't even know you're using
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.000]   Of vpn it's the only one i use express vpn
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.960]   100 of your traffic is encrypted of course
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:31.760]   And your privacy is guaranteed make sure your online activity and data is protected with the best vpn money can buy
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.200]   It's not expensive
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.200]   Less than seven bucks a month
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.320]   Uh when you get our special offer and i think that's well worth it to have that kind of privacy
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.080]   security
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.560]   And occasionally to watch a you know, maybe watch a little anime from netflix japan
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:52.240]   Express vpn.com/tuit if you go there right now three extra months through our special link
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.860]   e xp re s s vpn.com/t
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:00.240]   W it please use that address so that they know you saw it here
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.680]   We thank you for their support express vpn.com
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.680]   slash
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.680]   tWitt
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.320]   We've been spending a lot of time over the last week talking about the last pass
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.040]   breach steve gipson did a an entire episode
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.080]   On it which i'll give you a hint he titled leaving last pass
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:29.680]   Uh earlier today on advanced the tech guy we we talked about how to export your data from last pass, but also the risks
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.040]   um, I don't there is a lawsuit
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.000]   uh, which the
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.320]   plaintiff hopes to turn into a class action lawsuit. I don't think he's got class status yet. He claims he lost
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.480]   I think 53 000 because of the last the last pass breach
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.960]   We don't know much about what happened because last pass hasn't been super forthcoming
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.960]   Um, but
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:59.360]   It's quite the opposite from a journalistic point of view. I have to say they've been absolutely closed mouth about it. Let's say let's be fair
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.880]   Make a statement. Yeah
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:06.320]   Uh, the only thing that they said well in july they said oh, yeah social engineering
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.120]   Guy, uh got into our source code
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.240]   Uh, okay fine
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.800]   Then a couple months later say oh and by the way after that guy got in the source code he used what he learned there
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:24.000]   To get into our systems and some customer information some they didn't say what customer information was released now
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:32.640]   Three days before christmas interesting timing. They said oh, you know what actually the guy got the entire backup of all the encrypted vaults
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.240]   Yeah, that's about as bad as you can get
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.920]   I mean thank you
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.920]   Sorry, yeah
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:46.960]   We'll do what it's gonna say. Yeah. I mean they have to crack those vaults. They are encrypted using, uh
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:53.840]   Aes t5 six. Yeah, although uh steve talked about this early on when last pass first started
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.360]   Years ago and when we first started talking about them they were using
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:04.400]   uh hashing function called pbkdf2 to hash the passwords or the master password and
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:13.040]   Only 500 iterations or maybe it was 5000 but it was far it was fine then 5000 was fine then but 5000 today is way too low
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.880]   It really does open you up to brute forcing last pass advanced that to 100,000
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.320]   100
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:27.120]   A couple of years ago, but not everybody got automatically advanced and we and we don't know the last pass vault that was
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.080]   The vaults that were exfiltrated. We don't know when they were backed up or how many of them had
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.880]   the the higher number of hashes
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.160]   You need at least 100,000 these days effect. Oh, wasp recommends 300,000 iterations
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:48.080]   Uh of pbkdf2 to protect your master password. So there is some real concern legitimate. I think real concern that
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.040]   What's gonna happen now that this we don't know when it happened. We don't know how much they got
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.200]   Steve I said, it's the crown jewels. It is the one thing that they have to protect
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:03.040]   Yeah, it's their one job. Yep. You have
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.480]   Secret key covers in the radius. Sorry
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.520]   No, no, I'm saying for those of us that are like one password
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.920]   Like even if you got my vault you ain't doing nothing with my vault because you still need the secret key
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.160]   So you got it same with last pass same with last pass. The problem is there are a couple problems here
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.520]   Uh once you have the vault you can apply every bit of brute force you wish right
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.560]   Now if it's well if you had a good master password that was really long
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.560]   um, and if it's properly hash probably you're okay
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.480]   but
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:41.360]   There are going to be people out there who's master password because you have to remember it remember is monkey one two three
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:47.040]   They're going to be people out there. That's the 20 part about one my clients. I get everybody my family and my everybody
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.800]   I get the one one password, right?
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:54.800]   I have had last pass two for a minute from a team that I work with and they insisted on using that because at the time
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:59.680]   They were the they were more they were the best. That's why we they we they advertised with us for years
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.120]   They were yeah, what's the word i'm looking for it? Oh, they they worked on all the platforms and they're completely cross platform, right?
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:09.040]   Right, right, yeah, but but then eventually one password became cross platform
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:16.400]   But I've always got my clients on that and I was getting irritated when i'm going and the client has the one password password tape to the monitor
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.120]   Yeah, I was like that wasn't the whole point jerk case
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.720]   Or but I understand that because you have to remember that password once you're using a password manager
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:31.920]   The good news is from now on you use each password is a new fresh password just for that site and it's long and strong and non memorable
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.920]   But you do still have to have that master password and you stop to remember that and you enter it all the time
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.680]   um
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:43.200]   I asked Steve. I said look I use a ubiki. I've used a ubiki for years to for two two factor
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:47.920]   if people use two factor are they safer and he said no unfortunately
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:52.960]   And he said the the person who has these vaults
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.840]   Doesn't need the two factor to un to get your master password and open the vault
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:04.000]   That's only for you when you're locking in or if a bad guy's logging in on your machine then the two factor is handy
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.320]   So we're pretty vulnerable. I I don't know what's gonna happen
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.760]   But I I wonder if we're gonna start to see over the next few months more and more people say oh
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.640]   I've you know my
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.120]   Somebody's got my passwords
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.360]   Wait, no, I thought okay. So this may be me be a confused
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.800]   I thought the thing about from for instance for one password
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:34.080]   Even if you know the master password when you first put it on the machine before you could do anything you got to get through the secret key
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.840]   Yeah, that's because actually stored there. That's because
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:46.320]   You are logging in now to mass last pass a server to get the vault the vault downloaded your machine the guy has the vault
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.880]   He doesn't need that second factor. He has the vault all he has to do
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:56.720]   It's like he took the safe home and gets to work. He has the safe in his house
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:03.360]   So that's why this is so no white advantage that didn't cross through the old melon skis over here, but hey
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:10.800]   It's still full of Japanese food. No, no, you're not alone. In fact, one of the reasons we've been talking about it on all the shows is because I want people to understand
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.320]   The risks here if they have your vault
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.240]   If you had a last pass account and by the way because they haven't been forthcoming on
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:25.040]   Okay, they said somebody got our vault backups. Okay, but when were they backed up from where they from a year ago two years ago last month
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:31.280]   They didn't say I had a last pass account for years. I deleted my vault about two years ago
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.120]   But if the backup predated that then they have my vault, right
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:42.880]   So it's not if you reuse passwords then that's that's even worse. Yeah. Yeah. Now. I'm hoping I deleted my vault
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.960]   And it wasn't in the backup this guy got
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:50.560]   but for many people who are using last pass now or whoever used last pass at this point
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:57.120]   You just crossing your fingers or you do what I've told everybody by the way, we use last pass enterprise here
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.360]   So we're we're still last pass users
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:04.000]   Uh, my wife uses it. I said Lisa what you have to do at this point is change
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.080]   All your passwords the most important passwords start with the ones that don't have two factor
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.080]   Those have to be changed and then if you are using two factor
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.800]   Well, that's good news because the bad guy would still have to use two factor to get into your bank or whatever
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.120]   But you should eventually change that as well
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:25.040]   Uh, that's a lot of work. You gotta remember to change them change them like in a time basis as well
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.600]   Because if you're okay, like for instance
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.480]   If you're using all of the password managers tell you like every couple of months that you should change these passwords
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.800]   That's wrong. No, and I think that's wrong
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:38.720]   Um, nist used to recommend this. This was a bad recommendation
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:47.120]   They recommended rotating passwords and and it's not necessary unless you're thinking your password vaults be regularly being stolen
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:53.680]   Maybe you should maybe now that is good advice. Yeah, like maybe that is good advice
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.320]   But that's what I was thinking. I was thinking the back up would be old right so that even if they got the password
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.240]   I'm still wrong. Right. But yeah, most people don't change it unless you have
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.560]   But let me point this out if they whatever the master password was
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.720]   When that vault was backed up that's still the master password no matter what you do
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:17.760]   You're not changing that vault you're only changing your current vault the one the bad the vault the bad guys brought home
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:23.360]   It's whatever the password was then it's whatever the pbkdf2 iterations were then
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.080]   It's however weak it was then nothing you do today will make that go away
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.440]   Except changing all the passwords in that old vault so that what if they do break into it? They can't break into your stuff
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.560]   It's kind of a mess
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:44.960]   Um, it's a huge mess. It's as bad as you can get killing me. We got to make it the p as your password
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:53.280]   I got a tick back. How long I gonna go to bathroom. So you're over there. Why why are you drinking all of this water?
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.920]   Look, man. I gotta pay my taxes. I can't get in
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.680]   Uh, you want you want to take a break and change all your passwords? You can do that if you if you
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:08.320]   I've got to say this really sort of brings back the the importance of occasionally analog password stuff
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:13.600]   Um, absolutely. Yeah, really important passwords. I don't put them in a password manager
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.160]   I write them down and I hide them somewhere in the house
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.400]   In a way that in some way that thieves would never look I eat books
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.920]   So, you know if there's a book in there, it's got your passwords
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.560]   And then just update them at the time and you don't have to put those key passwords out
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:34.560]   I'll never forget going to target and looking in the notebook section. There's a notebook nice tall one that says passwords
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:39.280]   It was gold leaf
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.640]   But honestly
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:47.600]   The the old folks like my mom who've been writing down their passwords. They're safer because you'd have to break into her house
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:52.160]   As long as she didn't reuse them and made good ones. They're actually safer
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:56.960]   So and that's one reason a number of people and I'm can going back and forth on this
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.640]   Uh, our sponsor bit warden lets you host your own vault so that it's not in the bit warden
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   If you're not the most sensible operation, I don't know. I mean asking someone to host their own stuff
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.800]   I mean, I'm not an expert
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.800]   But yeah, that's why I've always let
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:19.280]   Last pass and now bit warden host it because I figure well there's security gurus, but that didn't work out so well for
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:24.640]   Last pass users. Well, I mean, yes for something like that. It's a one-time thing
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:30.240]   Um, also the thing that the risk is that last pass is a cent is a single point of failure, right?
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:35.040]   They have them all right if it's you and it's on Dropbox somebody has to be going after your dropbox and
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.640]   Getting your vault there and they still have to go through the decryption process. So
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.720]   I've changed my tune. I used to say let them host it because they're experts
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.880]   I'm not and I could do something stupid
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.680]   But now I'm thinking maybe you have an advantage of a little bit of security through obscurity by not having your vault in a central location
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.480]   You'd have to run a last unless you're someone like a journalist
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.600]   Yeah, what do you do? What do you do if you're vulnerable?
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:06.080]   There you have a higher risk profile. That's what I mean. Yeah, what if yeah, what if you're you know, it depends on what your your threat profile is
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:10.800]   But if you're a dissident or a journalist or you live somewhere where it's not okay to be you
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.680]   Um, but then what do you do
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.960]   Well, I mean, I was part of the google's advanced
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.880]   Protection system that they introduced for journalists when they first brought it out
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:25.680]   So you've got a ub key and you've got a bluetooth thing and you have to log in, you know, if you're coming in
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.200]   To your existing account on a new computer. You've got to have this with you. Otherwise you're locked out
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.720]   It's a bit of a pain in the arse if you actually lose the key
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.000]   but it's actually a pretty good security system
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.600]   but
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:44.080]   You know for mass market people just don't do this
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.360]   I mean
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:50.560]   Google introduced two factor authentication for gmail for example and 10 years later
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.760]   Less than 20 percent of people were actually using it. They actually started forcing people didn't they?
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.880]   Yeah, they had to because as I say
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.400]   This is not that people want convenience not security
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.480]   Um, and this is part of the problem I have with password management
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:10.960]   In that it sounds like a great solution until the last pass thing happens
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.320]   And that it all goes to help so I I have to say even if you're using last pass
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:21.840]   You're still better off in most cases because most users reuse passwords
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.000]   Yep
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.920]   And that's the worst case. It's true. Yeah, right?
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.880]   It's true. Yeah, there's this thing on Netflix right now
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:38.240]   It's called kaleidoscope and it's an interesting show premise because you could jump in at any one of the think 12 episodes
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.960]   You can watch them in any order, but it tells like, you know, the story of a heist
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.440]   from like multiple angles
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.080]   And one of the things they had in there, which was really funny
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:53.600]   Is the the guy who they're trying to break into his vault. He had a gate detection
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.480]   So the vault is down the hallway and as you're walking down the hallway
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.760]   It knows it's not him because everybody has a unique gate. Okay like g at like how you walk
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:07.840]   Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, Google's been doing that. Interesting
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.160]   Like thing to come up with
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:15.840]   Um, no, it's real. I would Japan. It's real. I've been studying this. Yeah. Yeah, really? Yes
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.480]   Well, see that was funny to me because right before I went to Japan
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.440]   I accidentally like literally hours before I got a plane
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.720]   I accidentally kicked the couch and full blast and broke my toe
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.040]   So you got a different way now, baby
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.760]   That means I wouldn't be able to get into my
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:34.480]   Money bonds because I remember when I was in college
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.000]   I was going walking down the street and a guy said a Leo and I said it was like 100 feet away
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.760]   I said how did you know it was me? He said I could tell by how you walk you have a distinctive
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:48.160]   I don't know what I was a silly walk or what but you have a distinctive gate
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:53.440]   And google says everybody does and your phone can detect it because of the accelerometers
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:59.600]   We had the guy from we had the former or something of either the fbi or the cia
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   at one of our structure conferences like in 2014 and he got up on stage and he was like we love Fitbit
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.480]   Um, we can totally tell who different people are based on their gate. Everyone was like, oh my gosh
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.280]   It's and then they forgot about promptly. So yeah
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:17.680]   No, I mean it's it's also got applications to the kind of health things that we're talking about from CES
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.760]   I mean fully commonly the famous Scottish comedian was diagnosed with his
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:28.240]   Dermal American condition simply because he was walking across a room and a doctor knew what he was talking about
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.720]   So on a second you're showing
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:38.480]   Signs of this particular illness isn't that interesting and see your doctor right now. This is all incredibly valuable stuff
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:43.680]   But yeah, it's what we're learning from smartwatches more and more
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:49.680]   We're hearing stories about people whose apple watches saved their lives because it detected a fib or some other heart condition
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:54.480]   And said you should see your doctor. I'm sure gate will be the next thing
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:00.560]   That's it has a little bit although in in terms of the gate thing for apple headquarters in particular when the the
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.560]   You know when the watches first came out
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:08.480]   They got this thing that it's good to walk around for 10 minutes every hour, which is perfectly valid
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.760]   But the problem was they were automatically set for the last 10 minutes
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:14.320]   Everybody gets up
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:17.040]   10 to the hour
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:22.640]   No, I noticed that in the early days of the stand detection everybody had to get up at 10 minutes till the hour
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.800]   The fix that is it now staggered. Nope. It still comes on at 50 to me
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:31.760]   I swear it comes on at the fifth. It's always the minute 50 every time it looks better. I mean get up
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:36.320]   You know, it's because you haven't done it yet. I mean it how would you do it?
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.000]   Truly
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   One of the things that's funny. I guess you're right. It's the end. It's coming up in the hours what you're saying stacy
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.080]   So yeah, you haven't done it yet
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.720]   So that really is only a problem with people like us who are completely sedentary doc
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:53.600]   We're always sitting down. We're just I I find what are strangest things to me?
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.920]   And this is maybe it's not the problem with you there
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:01.520]   But here locally many of the state or local services that I have to log in to do something
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:05.680]   They still have like eight to 16 character password limits
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.520]   And i'm like
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.640]   Crazy
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.560]   And i'm like yo, you're the city like tax office, right?
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.040]   Or the conveyance office and I can't make a complicated password
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.840]   so those ones are
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.800]   Probably some of the first level that these people who are into this kind of like
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:28.240]   It sex stuff get into is going through
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:36.720]   Everybody has to deal with their state locally entities at some point and a lot of them still have weak password requirements and that's super obnoxious
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:41.440]   So I would hope that somewhere on a federal level after enough people get in trouble
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:47.280]   Uh, maybe they should fix that sort of thing, you know, and they're still yelling at the big tech which I get but
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.200]   They gotta look at your old. We had the story on mac break weekly this week
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:57.680]   When the apple fall detection first came out remember people on roller coasters were accidentally calling 911
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.160]   Uh now it turns out skiers
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:06.960]   Uh the ski season who wear apple watches there was a huge increase in color rado fake or false or
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:14.720]   Not real 9-1-1 calls from their apple watches because they were going down the slopes and they didn't notice because they probably had you know
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:19.760]   Gloves and stuff on they didn't notice that their watch was calling 911 and it's a big problem
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:22.400]   in in these downs color running
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:29.760]   They'll fix it. Oh, yeah, and oh, yeah, so still I mean that's how this stuff balance. It's great, right?
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:37.200]   Yeah, it's early days. Yeah. Yeah, I got my mama at apple watch because she's 90 and if she falls I want her to have help
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:44.080]   As someone who passes out on the regular I almost switched apple ecosystem just for that feature
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.480]   But I just couldn't bring myself to do it
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.400]   You'd rather just pass out you put the thing as you wake up
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.480]   Yeah, eventually I'll get up. It's fine
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:58.720]   You probably don't it's not a life-threatening thing. Yeah, you probably don't want nine
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.160]   You know emergency services coming every single time you pass out that wouldn't be good
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:08.000]   No, I I actually tell people never call 911 if I pass out unless I'm bleeding or something
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.360]   Are you are you are you having epileptic seizures or something or?
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:18.160]   No, I just have pots. I just pass out pots. It's what I do. Uh pass out. It's
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:25.280]   Terminal no, it's post osteo something something syndrome. Someone all know what it is. It's basically
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.440]   When you stand up too quickly you get biteheaded. Oh, yeah
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:36.160]   My heart rate doesn't it doesn't push enough blood and it just goes super. Yeah, so you should stand up more slowly stacy
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:40.560]   I'm just saying or don't stand up at all. Yes, because I'm such a slow and patient
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.200]   I
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:49.120]   Even the fbi says you may be ought to use a an ad blocker
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:52.480]   This always cracks me up because law enforcement on the one hand
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:57.920]   Really wouldn't prefer you, you know, not be private not encrypt not protect yourself in any way on the other hand
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.800]   Gosh, you guys got to protect yourselves out there
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.320]   Uh the fbi in a pre-holiday psa
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.600]   So that cyber criminals are buying ads
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:16.480]   You know like the ads that show up on your websites to impersonate legit brands like oh, guess what cryptocurrency exchanges
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:20.160]   Uh, they often show up as the top of uh search results
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.520]   They can look identical to the brands. They're impersonating
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:28.480]   You know all of these this ad sales stuff is automated, right? There's no person saying
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.360]   Oh, let me see what you like to buy and add it at the top of the search. All right. It'll be $50
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:37.920]   It's all completely automated. So that means bad guys can take advantage of it
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:43.680]   Malicious ads are also used to trick victims and installing malware designed disguised as genuine apps
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.480]   The fbi's recommendation
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:48.800]   install an ad blocker
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:53.040]   So I agree installing that block don't block our ads
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:59.760]   If you would I was gonna say i've got skin in this game. So can I present your position? Yes, yes
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:07.040]   Yes, certainly ads have been used for years now to push malware out push false stuff out as well
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.880]   Um, and I have no problem with people using ad blockers
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:16.320]   But if you trust the site you should disable them for that particular site good. I like to eat. Yes
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:22.400]   Um, but I mean advertising supported copy is still a major force on the internet
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.160]   Um, yes, it can be used to push malware out
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:31.680]   But if you've got an ounce of sense then you know, it's a tricky case
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.960]   actually
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.640]   related to this
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.600]   the irel irish the irelish
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.280]   Uh
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:44.080]   Uh privacy regulators have fined meta over 400 million dollars
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:49.120]   For forcing users to accept targeted ads and told meta they can no longer
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.880]   Do add targeting unless they get permission
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:59.120]   From their users, which of course nobody on facebook when asked this is the this is what happened with apples
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.560]   ATT as soon as apple said, uh, hey, you want this app to track you everybody said well no
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:11.680]   No, no. Thank you. So this is going to be a big issue. Uh, I mean, yes on the one hand I support your right to choose
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.560]   But for for people like Ian and me
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.200]   Uh, if if you can't sell ads against your audience
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:25.760]   That's problematic, right? That's probably bad. I've had to voice now a funding source, but yeah
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:28.560]   I've got to say also. I mean
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.800]   I applaud the Irish authorities for doing this and it does seem like they're paying actually no
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.280]   They didn't want to million suit. They didn't want to they were forced to
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.360]   Yeah, I mean
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360]   400 million though for
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:47.120]   I know that's nothing down the back of the soap but more importantly
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:52.800]   They're going to change the rules and say you know the irish have ruled that you have to ask for permission
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.040]   And if I presume that's more than just facebook that would be everybody who wants to do
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.680]   Personalized ads you have to ask permission now and you have there is a big crowner it
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:08.160]   Oh, it's good. I was gonna say there is a big crackdown, but it's not that big because I think france find apple
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:14.240]   Um eight million euros. These are tiny and we actually looked at the figures. That's 40 minutes profit
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.520]   Yeah, no, I don't this is a business expense at this point
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:23.360]   But they can charge more gdpr allows them to charge a significant percentage of global revenue in the long run if they enforce it
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.920]   Yeah, yeah, if they really want to get you know
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:30.160]   By the but so before you applaud ir the irish
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:35.040]   Regulators they didn't want to do this the european data protection board forced them to
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:39.520]   Right, but they and nevertheless they did it and it isn't a huge fine
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.480]   It's almost half a billion dollars, which sounds like a lot to you and me
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:49.920]   Probably not a lot to meta, but I think it's more concerning that there is and maybe not concerning maybe everybody's applauding this
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.280]   Shouldn't we be asked?
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.840]   If we want our information to be sold down right
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:00.960]   Or if they actually ask me people
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:02.640]   Sorry
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.440]   Oh, no, I was gonna say I mean well. Yeah, you go ahead
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:13.600]   We're all being tough a lot. I'm done. Just but I mean leo you and I have argued about this in the past you hate those cookie
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.000]   Um, oh the cookie banners
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.800]   I can't stand them honestly
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.840]   I like them because you can actually choose this stuff
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.960]   And you can set the problem is they're broken
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:30.000]   Sometimes you accept it and you come right back on the same device same site later
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.760]   They ask you again because they're not properly implemented because they didn't save a cookie to say that you said
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:40.720]   I don't want you to save cookies. Yeah, so it's a kids 22 like I'm I agree with you like
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.760]   I understand what they're for and why they work
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:49.360]   But they still can't get a good implementation and so what happens is when we come up with plans or policies
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:52.080]   To try to force something that's protectionary
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:57.280]   But we don't think it all the way through people end up just not wearing the seat belt
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.040]   That's exactly
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:04.480]   Remember the carry used to get in and you shut the door and it goes like this. Oh god. I thought they got rid of that
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.480]   Yeah, they had to because it was like you was choking
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:10.960]   So
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:13.680]   So it's funny because it the idea is great
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:19.920]   But can we ever just think it all the way through so we have a way so that it works and it works?
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:28.240]   Well, I I think also companies are actually playing against this in that if you will say right, I will only accept this cookie or this cookie
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:34.080]   In number of sites and I won't name names, but if you do that, it'll be like
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:39.680]   Okay, we shall just update your platform and then you'll get the spinning wheel for 30 for 60 minutes
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.920]   Sorry 60 seconds to encourage people just go okay all the way
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:50.160]   So, you know, there's there's more than one element to this. Yes. Yes
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.120]   What were you gonna say no to stacy?
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.480]   I have no idea, but I agree
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.480]   I think it was probably along those slides. No
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:06.240]   There's no there's an incentive not to there's an incentive not to implement it in a way that is user-friendly
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.560]   And there's also always going to be unintended consequences and that's that's the
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.320]   Yeah, Jeff does this a lot on this week in google
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.840]   And he's he's constantly like we can't make laws because it'll hurt these people
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:25.120]   It might and we have to like we have to stop thinking about laws as like a universal good and start thinking of them as
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.360]   between yes different
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:34.560]   Competing actions. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, or even like convenience versus security and so I mean
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:40.400]   Part like in the media. That's how we should be talking about these things and we're not 100 percent. Yeah
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:45.200]   I hate when they make like this is a this is a trance onto our freedom
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:48.800]   I'm like, how did you get to this thing to complain about the freedom?
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:54.080]   Well, I drove and you drove using what a car in order to drive the car you need a what?
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:58.880]   A license oh freedom like come on dude. Can we get off of this?
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.760]   As long as we're talking about this doc rock did you know that your auto warranty has expired
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:06.560]   and
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:13.200]   I love those calls the worst play with those people the robo call campaign fcc has now proposed a record
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.480]   300 million dollar fine
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.480]   Because those auto warranty robo calls
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:28.800]   They almost all came from one group one company what two men that's crazy two men
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.040]   Roy Cox jr. And michael erin jones since 2018 two guys
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:43.200]   Orchestrated the scam that sent billions and billions of calls using a network of domestic. I wonder how much they're made
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.520]   Like I really want to admit this is mean. I know this is mean
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.320]   I'm sorry if you wanted them, but I wonder who is stupid enough to buy a warranty from these people
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:56.080]   And they had to work because they did it for how many years
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:00.000]   So I would I would I would have made it the investigation
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.640]   Not enough things out at low cost. That's exactly right
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.480]   Something idiot will will would do it and this is the way of it
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.960]   I mean honestly, I thought the fine was too little
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:13.280]   I would prefer them to have been kept in a room and everyone who's received a robo call
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:15.840]   Slap them in the face once a year
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.920]   They they reached more than half a billion us phone numbers wait a minute. How many
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.960]   There's how many 330 million people in the united states, but 500 million us phone numbers
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:35.040]   So basically every people have mobile and most of you got called twice with more than six billion calls
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:41.040]   in the first three six billion calls in the first three months of 2021
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:46.640]   six billion so half a billion phone numbers six billion calls
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.560]   That I mean every number got 12 calls
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.680]   I have an android phone
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.640]   And I never got one of them none of them ever made it through
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:02.080]   Google's voicemail spam thing was awesome. Really well. Yeah, it really works very well into you
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:05.120]   It was funny the at and t protecting
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.720]   um
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:11.360]   I remember being in a situation where friends and I were having lunch and I got one was caused
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.720]   and then
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:18.480]   As soon as I hung up from the person because it was starting to learn how to get an 808 area code
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:23.040]   Right that's been the most crazy one and being a business owner at the time
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.120]   I got to answer the phone got to see who it is
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.800]   And then I hung up and in my buddy's phone ring and my other buddy's phone ring and the last I was like wait a minute
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:33.680]   Everybody here got AT&T and they were like, yeah
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:38.400]   And so that was the craziest thing to me is to be in a situation they have all the
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.200]   The robo calls happened to a group of people at a lunch table. That was just weird
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:50.880]   But because have a have an end built uh bias in terms of not dealing with this and they make a small amount of money from each call
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:53.600]   So, you know, they
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:54.240]   Right
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:47:00.720]   Spam spam doesn't get their act together and actually say look at AT&T charges you for robo per jake, which is here's the good
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.800]   It's free now, but before it used to be fine
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:07.600]   The FCC is finally they've been doing very slowly, but they finally move towards making this illegal
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:11.040]   They have that stir and shake in protocol and they're slowly moving
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:21.360]   Overseas carriers into off of this protected list so that and requiring att sprint t mobile verizon to block
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.320]   Calls that are not authenticated. So it according to the FCC the number of
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:29.440]   robo calls
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.440]   dropped 99
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:36.000]   Once this shakin instered framework was implemented
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.280]   uh
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:41.440]   According to uh robo killer, which is a service that kills these robo
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.440]   calls that remain at a lower level
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:52.400]   Uh since we reviewed trends in october 2022, which leaves us hopeful. This is the final nail in the coffin for the infamous car warranty robo call
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:54.240]   Uh
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.040]   But what's happens is it's just one or two people that does all of this
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:01.600]   The FCC's previous record fine was against a telemarketer in texas
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.120]   225 million dollars in november
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:11.360]   The agency took action against a voice service provider earth access u rth
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:17.760]   Earth access 40 percent of october student loan debt relief scam calls getting those i did
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.000]   I have i don't have a student loan 40 percent came from one company
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:28.640]   Uh and eventually these these i think these companies will be removed from the network entirely which let's hope so are you
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.440]   Anybody getting text now instead of the yeah, that's why
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:35.600]   The text was more funny because they're all
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:41.440]   Crack little about the text every time and i just been taking shots of them and posting them on hygiene from time and time
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:45.520]   They'll be good and they'll miss one stupid typo
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:51.840]   Or they'll gap something and i was like you freaking idiots if you got that one little part right you catch more people
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:55.360]   Like i almost want to consult them or not to do it
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.880]   But it's always oh we got a package waiting for you
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.720]   And i'm always getting packages i have to look at it again and like yeah dhl is not going to takes me
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:10.560]   From some weird stupid number to tell me that my package from small rig is coming in late
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.440]   But it's it's really funny to see the typos and stuff that they put in and it's like oh my god
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.520]   If you guys knew how to spell you might catch more people
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:20.480]   They call this by the way smishing
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:23.840]   Because it's fishing via sms
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:27.760]   They when i say they i'm gonna put that in aircourse
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:28.880]   They
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.480]   Called smishing
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:36.560]   But this is why i was so encouraged to see lina khan, you know as as head of the fcc because she takes the stuff seriously
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.840]   um
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.640]   And the fcc has finally got out as gridlock and is starting to move on this
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:48.160]   And yeah, they will face the wrath of khan and she knows what she's talking about and she knows where the weak spots are
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.320]   So all power let's get it done. Did any of you see that's the ftc
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.720]   Ftc. Oh damn it tc
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:56.960]   And the ftc is rosen wars and wars
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.400]   You know what?
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.800]   We are waiting for gg sewn to be gg
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.920]   They've made the nomination again
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:08.480]   But now that we control the senate gg has a shot. Let's see. So yeah
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.640]   Um, did you did you everything you said about khan is right though?
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.960]   Did you see the movie yesterday?
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.320]   Remember that movie yesterday where guy gets hit in the head
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.840]   And the and wakes up and the beetles never existed
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:28.720]   And but he remembers all the beetle songs. So suddenly starts to become a superstar singing yesterday and other beetle songs
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.800]   Everything's a great movie
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:35.040]   If you saw the trailer, well, if you saw the trailer, you might have said oh
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:39.120]   It's it's a new anisea dermas film
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:44.560]   Except that even though she was in the trailer she was cut out of the movie
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:48.960]   So somebody sued saying wait a minute
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.680]   I went to see that movie expected to see anisea dermas and she wasn't in it us district judge steven wilson
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:59.040]   Says yes, you can sue
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:05.360]   Universal sought to throw out the lawsuit saying first amendment first amendment. That's an artistic expressive work
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:12.160]   The judge said well the trailer is commercial speech subject to california's false advertising law
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:18.240]   Universal is correct the judge wrote the trailers involved some creativity and editorial discretion
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:24.080]   But this creativity does not outweigh the commercial nature of a trailer and it's core a trailer is an advertisement
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:30.400]   Design is sell a movie by providing consumers with a preview of the movie and if you've got somebody in the trailer that isn't in the movie
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.800]   That's false advertising
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.520]   So there
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:38.480]   So they sued them for giving away the whole story in the trailer
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:42.800]   Oh god if he could that would bally would be bankrupt the plaintiffs
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:52.080]   Each paid $3.99 to rent yesterday on amazon prime. They're seeking five million dollars in compensation
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.120]   Wow
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.520]   Now the trailers the class in the class section
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.320]   There are whole sections of rogue one in the trailer which don't appear in actual film
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:06.240]   So, you know the judge said there's that's okay. There's some things that are okay
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:11.120]   But if you put a known face in the trailer and she's not in the movie
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.760]   That's that's going too far
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.640]   um
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:20.000]   Tesla this happened in uh, I think had happened in the bay air. No. No, I'm sorry happened in germany
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.960]   a driver in jeremyd
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.080]   fell asleep at the wheel and led a
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:28.560]   medium speed chase
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:35.360]   For many miles fella fella sleep is a little bit generous. He was stoned off his guard. Oh, okay
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:40.640]   I was like wow was he stoned? December 29th 12 p.m. Local time police spotted a tesla
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:44.800]   Driving down auto bond 70 leaving bamberg heading towards bay route
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:52.000]   Officers attempted to stop the tesla the vehicle did not pull over the car was traveling at exactly 70 miles an hour
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.040]   And did not slow down or speed up
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:56.960]   Just kept
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:02.480]   The tesla says the officers kept the same distance from the patrol car in front they put a patrol fire in front of it
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:05.440]   The patrol's are slow down the car slows down speeds up the car speeds up
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:09.440]   Officers pulled up next to the tesla's driver side window notice the driver
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:16.160]   Only identified as a 45-year-old man reclined in his seat with his eyes closed and his hands off the steering wheel now
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.440]   You may know I know you do stacey because you have a tesla that his tesla
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:24.880]   Periodically says keep your hands in the wheel reminds you to jiggle the wheel. He had a weight
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:28.080]   attached to the wheel hanging from it
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:33.120]   So that it wouldn't bother him while he took his name
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:39.840]   Driver is being investigated for criminal endangerment and his license has been
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:43.360]   Suspic, I mean sure but tesla
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:48.560]   This is why they really should not be allowed like talking about false advertising. Well in california
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:54.640]   No longer california. They can no longer advertise full self-driving because that's not what it is exactly because it isn't
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.440]   I mean
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.440]   The exfil that seems fair. Yeah
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:04.640]   All right, I want to take a little break and remind everybody that
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.520]   This show had one ad today
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:11.200]   Uh, and i'm sorry to say the ad market is getting tougher
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:18.800]   The Verge just had an article saying podcast advertising has dropped off the face of the earth for a variety of reasons recession
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:22.960]   COVID other things maybe the large number of podcasts
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:27.040]   We saw this coming. That's why two years ago almost two years ago
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:28.000]   We started club twit
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:33.120]   We knew that in order to keep twit going to keep starting new shows to keep growing
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:36.880]   We needed to get our audience to support us and club twit has been a huge success

[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:39.280]   Uh bit of business I will mention which is we have a survey. We do this once a year every january
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:43.520]   We uh, we survey our audience to get to know you better. It helps us
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:51.200]   Find advertisers. So it's important because we don't want to we don't use trackers. We don't want to track you but the advertisers do want to know well
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:56.640]   Who's listening? But we also want to know more about you so we know what kinds of shows you like and what we should do
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:01.040]   Going forward. It should only take a few minutes. It's of course completely optional
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:06.640]   Every question is optional as well go to twit.tv/survey 23 it runs through the rest of the month
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:12.720]   But if you would do that uh sooner than later that would be great because I know it's easy to forget and put these things off twit.tv
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.200]   slash survey 23

[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:20.960]   Different week on twit because it was our best ofs the holiday week
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:28.320]   But we've put together we had some fun earlier this week too a little promo to tell you all about what happened this past week on twit
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:30.960]   Watch first show of 2023
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:36.240]   I am back from the tropics. I bought this hat on the beach. You like it
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:41.120]   Join it. Stacy's not here. She's a ceas but glen fight because of that hack
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:44.320]   She didn't be very done. I'm not gonna be associated
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:52.800]   Maybe nowhere near it previously on twit that is true all about and if you're looking for a good time in vegas
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:57.520]   It's the wireless power consortium. That's where you want to be. That's where all the action happens
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:03.440]   It was announced that she to wireless magsafe tech is coming to android
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:09.200]   Um, it's this is made popularized by the apple iphones security now
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:16.880]   Uh, we're gonna spend the entire podcast looking at a single topic, which is last pass
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:19.360]   What happened? What does it mean?
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:23.280]   How how worried should you be? What are the consequences?
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:25.520]   and
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:32.320]   What's next this week in google instead of enjoying a late thanksgiving meal with his mother and georgia randal reed spent nearly a week
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:34.480]   In jail in november
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:40.160]   Falsely identified as a luxury purse thief by louisiana authorities using face recognition
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:44.800]   That's the whole unintended consequences of this this facial recognition because when it works
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:51.600]   It could work very well to to solve some problems, especially with crime and finding the actual right person
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:54.800]   There's so many things law enforcement could do to make his job easier
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:05:00.000]   They could put cameras in everybody's houses and and watch for illegal activities. Wait, wait, what?
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:04.000]   But I don't think we want that wishing you a happy new year
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:12.160]   Thank you the great immortal jim cutler and his little horn
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:16.640]   Here's a picture of doc rock you weren't in vegas doc, but uh, you were featured
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:20.960]   In a panel in las vegas. There you are wielding your light saber
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:26.240]   On the beach is so funny and that's a sony panel and that photo was taken with a nightcon
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:32.320]   Can you tell it? Can you tell it's a nightcon? Oh, no, I just know because my friend took the photo
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:36.480]   And he's holding the guy in the shot is holding a sony, but the guy
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:40.800]   Yeah, that's it. He's a awesome creator, especially if you're a sony camera person
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:45.120]   You should know he has a sony. I will an amazing creator. I'm a sony guy myself
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:46.720]   Like in the follow button right now
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.480]   Our friend was there with his nightcon
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:50.880]   But in order to take a picture of the two sony guys
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:56.320]   He had to use the z6 to take a picture of us and it ends up in the sony panel and the thing
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:00.720]   Before we switch, I just got to say one of my one of my discord members
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:05.760]   And she's actually the person who helps me manage my discord her name is discord for creators cute name
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:11.360]   Um, she just said she wants Stacy to be her best friend. So I had to pass it along does he say
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:17.440]   Yeah, he said that you're a rock star. Yes, and she's Canadian and cranky. So she's the rare
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.520]   Crenky
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:24.080]   No, that's why she is. Oh, that's why she's special. She's special. Okay. She's cranking
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:26.080]   I like
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:33.600]   Yeah, dude. She's amazing. She was actually on Alex's office hours last week talking about why more people should be jumping in the discord game
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:37.760]   Because of what's going on with meta and facebook groups and how horrible it is
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:42.880]   So she's a really really awesome person. And so I just had to say that so that way I don't get in trouble
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:47.440]   Well, maybe she should do ours because kevin and I were talking about doing a discord
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.560]   We two together and you probably will end up the investments. I really
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:56.640]   We basically were like we're not social enough. We don't have an aunt
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:02.080]   Yeah, this court is amazing. We're currently investigating where the doctor master and server ourselves
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:06.480]   And it's it's there's a lot of stuff to learn from that
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:08.640]   But I know a little bit about both
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:10.480]   I will say to you stacy and kevin
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:16.720]   If you don't want to start your own server, you can always we could create a home automation or we could get case kevin and stacy
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:20.880]   Section in our discord server. You'd be more than welcome to use it. That might be easier for you
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:25.920]   We're happy to host you if you'd like to but I think it's easy and free to start a discord server
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:28.240]   It's just depends on what I want to manage it. That's all
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:31.360]   We have an aunt. I don't want to mention it. Yeah
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:37.040]   And as for massed on I know a little bit about massed on because we run our own massed on server
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:40.960]   That's one of the things that you do indeed. Yeah, let's pay for at twit.social
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:45.520]   And uh, I strongly encourage you to do so if you have a community
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:50.000]   massed on is a great way to uh to talk to that community
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:54.640]   We have a community unfortunately about 5% of them are completely bonkers. So
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:59.680]   But you know, the old touched on this with the with the talk about
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:02.320]   Club twit
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:06.960]   People who are starting these things are especially podcast people you really need to go membership
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:11.600]   Like membership is better than waiting for the apple platforms or these other platforms
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:16.000]   Or even if you have a site that say open to the public giving people the chance to support you
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.880]   Through something like a membership with a couple of extra things
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:24.320]   It really does change the whole entire makeup and allows you to have better control over your creative process
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:27.200]   And the thing I would say there's actually an interesting article about
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:30.320]   A creatives where's at the times of the new yorker about how
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:34.560]   Really there's unfortunately no longer a middle class of creators
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:36.960]   There is just the people will make all the money
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:40.160]   The low can pause of the world and then the people who are struggling
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:43.840]   And I think we do need to work in some some way to make it possible for
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:46.880]   People to be creators and make a living at least
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:51.600]   Uh doing that but but I have to say the number one job
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:57.360]   For anybody who's a creator and it was certainly something I realized coming out of broadcasting into
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:02.720]   Podcasting is you have to build a community. It's all about it's not about audience
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:08.800]   It's about community and it takes the digital audience's fickle community is not
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:15.680]   Poya our community tells you that and i mean we have people been with us for 20 years
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:22.160]   It's fantastic and I think they enjoy being there you you include yourself doc rock and i've been there since day one
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.960]   Nice. I remember when you had normal looking hair
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.440]   It's a
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:29.440]   The al kitty has clothes
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:34.640]   Oh, like you had here so hey back then I had okay. Well, I remember you when you had hair there you go
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:36.320]   Exactly
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:41.280]   Uh, so it really is I think it's really the case that uh if you're going to be a creator you have to learn how to
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:45.120]   Grow and manage a community because that's what sustains you
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:51.520]   It's not the advertisers. It's the it's the community and uh and it's hot was took me a while because i'm a broadcaster
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:54.080]   Right broadcasting is all about audience. You don't know who you're talking to
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:10:00.000]   Uh, fortunately I've done talk radio for so long that kind of got a sense of you know people were able to talk back to me
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.200]   So I kind of got a sense of how important that is. I I love our community. I tell you it's
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:07.200]   well and
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:09.520]   As a journalist who is not maybe been
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:14.000]   Like, you know, I came into journalism thinking I was going to be like some sort of crusader, right?
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.200]   but
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:19.840]   even in like your if you do create a community it's very nice because
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:25.360]   You actually know who you're speaking to and you're actually helping those people about not always
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:29.120]   I mean sometimes they're just doing wrong thing. You're gonna be like look i'm gonna help you see the air of your ways
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:34.240]   But like it does give you some meaning in your job when you're like recording about p
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.800]   We yes
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:43.280]   We all grew up in an environment in a world where it was uh the platinum records and the superstars and the movie stars and the celebrities
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:47.040]   That that was the goal like or even a superstar journalist, right?
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:52.400]   Uh, that was the goal to become the big celebrity and I think we've all learned. Hey, that's not so much fun
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:54.800]   And you just talk to some of these celebrities that hate it
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:11:02.080]   Uh, because you can't you're no longer a normal life, but be it's not it's not really a healthy normal relationship
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:07.040]   When you do it this way if it's so much better it's smaller admittedly
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:12.640]   But if you have a few thousand fans that you communicate with regularly back and forth
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:18.000]   It is the most sustaining wonderful thing in the world and everybody should understand that that's the way
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.640]   As a as a person who coaches people on getting into this and like how to run their business
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:27.360]   I tell them every way like if you're planning on coming to this to do this as some sort of side hustle
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:32.080]   Let's just cancel that right away. I don't believe in a side hustle. I believe in the side helpful
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:36.800]   It's not like that people. I like that. It's complete game changer
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:40.640]   If you can find a way to be helpful and provide a positive impact on people
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.160]   It's it's all you need you're good to go. They'll be with you forever
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:49.120]   But if you're just trying to like figure out another way to coin up is just not going to work. It's very unsustainable
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:51.600]   Yeah, you're pointing out people know you're pointing up
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:53.200]   Coin up don't coin up. Hey
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:58.160]   I'm gonna say those you can use that was tasty. I'll give you a limited license
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:02.880]   And then I'll I'll raise the lifetime license in a couple years like phil mordin
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:09.760]   I mean, it's interesting how this has developed with digital to analog in that
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:14.320]   You know the first newspapers started out as people writing paid for newsletters
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:16.720]   Which went out to people who wanted to know what was going on
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:23.040]   That evolved into full-time newspapers and the internet came along and everyone started giving away for free
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:25.360]   And now we're switching back to a more
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000]   You know you pay for what you get
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:35.120]   You know if it's free ask yourself who's paying for it the most important lesson my history teacher ever taught me was
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:39.360]   If you read any document ask yourself three questions
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.880]   Who wrote it?
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:43.360]   Why did they write it and who paid for it to be written?
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:50.080]   And if it's the people that support you and the nurture the publication that are helping pay for that so much the better
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:53.200]   I know our
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:13:02.000]   Community knows the name creative labs, right? You remember the sound blaster. Yes sound blaster sound blaster
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.360]   I got a list menu system on a three-player
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:11.360]   But it was you know a breakthrough in its time
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:14.880]   I got it actually was interesting got an email from
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:19.680]   uh one of our community shanhong who was I believe malaysian
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:28.480]   Uh who said don't forget to mention sim wong who was the founder. Oh this project passed away. He was young 67
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:35.520]   um an american runner. Yeah in good shape. It was kind of uh, it's it's not clear what happened, but it's uh
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.400]   Uh a very sad passed away
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.240]   um
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:47.200]   Creative technology which is known as real player and said make it work. I remember that was my first mv3 player was a diamond real
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:49.680]   300 yeah
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:52.240]   um
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:55.840]   They very famously were sued by apple
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:01.440]   Uh apple had invented the ipod shipped in 2006 creative sued saying hey wait a minute
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:05.040]   We invented the uh the mp3 player
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:07.440]   uh
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:09.440]   Actually, uh shan sent me
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:14.320]   an interesting uh interview that sim did with cnbc
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:18.800]   Saying it was something we had to do because apple did not just infringe our patent
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:22.560]   St this is interesting steve jobs came to our booth
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:29.280]   They were doing the zen player at the time sar products liked the product. He saw the future of apple there
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:32.800]   He asked our people to go to his headquarters to present it to him
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:37.600]   Our people went to look for some collaboration. Unfortunately, I was not there. I was in singapore
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:40.480]   Maybe if I were there, maybe history would have changed
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:43.840]   He was trying to work something together, but it didn't turn out
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:52.000]   Job said no deal and released the ipod shortly after they won they settled with apple for a hundred million dollars
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:58.400]   Um, sorry. Sorry leo are you saying that apple actually stole some of this technology never
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:06.320]   Personal never shot shot. I am senn apparently had a real affinity for uh, um
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:09.280]   mr. Sim because he sent me some pictures of him
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:11.280]   uh
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:15.680]   Talking with him. He had an old cubic which was I guess an early creative product
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.800]   He decided to donate it to sim sim was very happy about uh about getting that
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:22.960]   so um
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:29.120]   Anyway, uh, I thought it was a good way to uh to end the show is to as we often do at the end of the show
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:34.240]   Is a little mmorium for somebody who was really important in the early days of the computer industry
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:38.640]   Many of us had sound blasters sound cards in our early pcs, right?
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:44.320]   Uh, many of us looked after his staff as well. I mean creative has one of the best
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:49.280]   Reputations, I've come across of companies that actually looked after their staff
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:56.400]   Management took you seriously. I think only Nokia is probably the better one, but they did give a monkeys
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:03.360]   Monkeys what do you want to do you want to finish their sense? No, no, uh, no, I mean, uh, sorry
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:10.400]   Britishism give a monkeys means actually, you know care give something here. I feel like there's more to that sentence, but okay
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.680]   Yeah, I I believe there would be more
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:19.680]   It's a family show. I don't want to say thank you the next stage
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:23.440]   We invite you on specifically so we can learn more about this thing called british
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:27.120]   A visionary in a banner in arterland or
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:30.000]   Then you really don't want to
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:36.800]   Sim Wong who uh 1955 through in january 4th 2023 as as it says on the creative site
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:41.280]   A visionary inventor and entrepreneur who gave the pc a voice
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:46.320]   Um, I think it's time to say good night to all our family
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:49.200]   Stacy. I'm glad you're home and feeling better
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:54.320]   I hope we will see you on wednesday on this week in google question mark

[02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:10.480]   Because I missed episode in a way a weekly
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:14.880]   Which would have been perfect because the 808 airy code you're in the
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:21.680]   Home, I'm in massachusetts. I'm on the road and we didn't want to chance the like dorky hotel internet
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.800]   So
[02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:28.160]   You know, I'm glad to be here whenever I can you were there in spiro was facing the end you were there in spirit
[02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:34.560]   Why aunt did you post a animated gif of a english breakfast?
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:40.080]   That's for Ian. Oh my he likes the beans and bacon asleep bad
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:47.280]   A little I'm sorry. I'm a I'm a i'm a moderator on a british fry up post and that's just
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:50.320]   Oh god
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:53.600]   So many beans you don't do that
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:57.440]   Why are there beans in the first place beans?
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:03.680]   No, seriously, you can't have a fry up without beans, but that many
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:06.480]   You know, that's kind of like
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:13.040]   Doing biscuits and gravy and having this the whole plate done with gravy. Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:16.320]   No, no, okay, right
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:18.320]   Are you saying the beans are like gravy?
[02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:23.200]   The beans provide the moisture that you use with a bubble and squeak and
[02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:25.920]   Like the black
[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:27.920]   I love this
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:35.040]   But you use a small amount of beans with a sausage bean dam to keep them back from everything else
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:43.360]   Um, and then the bubbling you started putting gets dis-it started. I thought we were doing it down the soccer hole rabbit hole
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:47.360]   No, instead we got a bubble is we got a bean dam
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:52.320]   What is bubble do you have do you have to wash it down with PG tips?
[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:57.840]   Oh, well, okay, you're your goal your girl your girl. The PG text is my is my standard
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:22:01.280]   um, okay bubble and squeak to explain is
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:05.120]   Um, we started the show with cooking reminds of a little bit of cooking, right?
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:09.440]   Uh, boiled, boiled cabbage and you mix them together and fry them
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:13.680]   Um, so it's kind of like hash browns, but with a bit of greenery in there
[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:18.480]   Um, cabbage and potato. Yeah, and then where do the beans come in?
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:22.560]   Uh, well, Heinz bait beans, which are we're just like ketchup
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:25.600]   Except it's beans
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:30.400]   No, this is put it on your bubble and squeak. I mean Heinz is an american company
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:35.440]   And yet getting Heinz bait beans over here is ridiculously difficult
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:40.480]   We all have these bacon filled fat beans that uh, the secret sit on the store
[02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:42.880]   But getting proper Heinz bait beans
[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:48.080]   I buy them from my local supermarket because they have an ethnic food section
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.720]   And bait british bait beans are in there
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:56.880]   And I actually met a Brit as we were both buying a can because yeah, I know they're five dollars a can but it makes me feel posh
[02:22:56.880 --> 02:22:59.120]   To actually eat them at that at that state
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:03.920]   But yeah, you got to have bacon egg beans sausage bubble mushrooms
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:06.800]   Yeah, and black pudding if you can get it
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:17.840]   Got to give it a mix. I have had enough of it. You guys go home eat whatever it is you eat bubble and squeak beans waffles
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:22.560]   Lemon cupcakes. I will I we're done. I'm done with you. Thank you
