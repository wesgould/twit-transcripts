[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.800]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.720]   Welcome to this week in tech, kind of a special this week
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.760]   in tech.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.080]   I decided to give the team the week off.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.520]   It's New Year's Day.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   No one's going to come in and work anyway.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.000]   And everyone certainly wouldn't be able to get any house.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.160]   But fortunately, there's a lot of good stuff
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.800]   we did over the past year.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.880]   And we thought it'd be kind of fun, as we've done in years
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.040]   past, to do a best of episodes.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.160]   So that's what we've put together for you today.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.480]   Kicking it off, oh, doctor, who's always a fun and wonderful
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.840]   guest on the show.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.400]   He just a hoot.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   And you probably remember back in November, he was a little
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.640]   teed off, shall we say, about Apple's new MacBook Pros.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.560]   Listen.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.480]   Actually, it's in the other room, the new Apple MacBook.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.680]   We did an interview yesterday on the new screen savers
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.560]   with Kyle Wiens.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.920]   He said, I fix it.com.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.880]   And as you know, I fix it.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.120]   Does tear downs of all of the new stuff whenever it comes out.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.720]   They did a tear down on the new MacBook.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.280]   It's kind of part of their mission, which is to kind of
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.800]   make repair manuals, tools, and parts available for everything.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.920]   So one of the things they do when they do a tear down
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.440]   is they rate these things on how easily you can repair them.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.960]   The new MacBook got a repair factor of one,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.800]   a parability of one out of 10.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.040]   The lowest--
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.960]   I said, could you go lower?
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.920]   He said, well, I guess you could get a zero.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.080]   But could you not, in fact, see that as the best?
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.840]   Like it's number one.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.200]   Maybe that's what they meant.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.560]   That's what Tim Cook says.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.520]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.320]   But in their mood, in their haste to make thinner, lighter
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.800]   notebooks, what Apple's really done is make notebooks
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.320]   with that there is-- it's not upgradable.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.000]   You can't add--
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.080]   It's a big iPhone.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.520]   It's a big iPhone.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.200]   It's exactly the model.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.000]   Even down to the point where not only the batteries
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.120]   not removable, they're so heavily glued in.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.080]   Kyle said it was almost impossible to get them out.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.120]   We had infinite patience.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.800]   But it's also-- and this is the thing that really bugs me--
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.280]   not recyclable.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.880]   He says--
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.360]   Really?
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   He says we hear from recyclers all the time who
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.760]   have fires from lithium ion batteries.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.640]   They're either left in by accident
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.880]   or we didn't find it.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.080]   And when they grind it up, of course,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.760]   as with any lithium ion battery explodes and bursts
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.640]   in the flame.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.240]   And it's a real problem for recyclers
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.120]   to the point where this is going in the landfill.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.680]   This is not going to be recycled.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.520]   Wait.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.200]   So Apple-- I remember years ago,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.800]   Apple getting heavily criticized for burning down the earth
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.920]   and being bad citizens of the world.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.640]   But they came back and they're like, oh no, but we do this.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.320]   And we have our new building is going to be lead certified.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.160]   It's a spaceship.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.640]   It can take us to Mars, it's Earth, ever melt down.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.920]   Like, I remember that press conference.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.080]   And they're a member of EP, you know?
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.920]   And their stuff is EP certified.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.560]   But I have to think it has a little bit
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.920]   to do with the millions of dollars they gave EP more
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.720]   than the sustainability of the electronics.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.640]   Here's what I'm going to propose.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.840]   By the way, it's not just Apple.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.360]   It's everybody.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.480]   This is the Google Pixel.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.200]   Sealed battery, right?
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.080]   Now, it may be possible to take it apart and take the battery
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.040]   out easily, I don't know.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.840]   But I think increasingly, the drive towards thinner electronics
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.360]   is driving us towards sealed cases and batteries.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.400]   Remember the days when you could take the back of a phone
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.520]   and replace the battery or pop the battery out of a laptop
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.360]   and put a new one in?
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.720]   I mean, the battery goes bad in a few years anyway.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.480]   These are essentially making disposable electronics.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.720]   And this is an awful big chunk of disposable electronics.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.240]   But are you sure that Liam can't take the battery out?
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.280]   Liam cannot take the battery out.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.480]   And by the way, so I asked that.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.880]   And Liam has a very particular set of skills.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.960]   Yes, he does.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.240]   It's like all iPhone.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.120]   He was meant for it.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.160]   Liam is not ready for Westworld yet.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.280]   So I asked Kyle, well, does an Apple recycle these?
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.600]   Because you're supposed to bring your old stuff back to Apple.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   He said, I know the recycler that Apple uses and no.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.480]   And so here's the issue--
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.600]   That's a crime.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.160]   Going forward, I think we as consumers.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.560]   For our own benefit, because replaceable batteries
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.080]   are good for us, it keeps the electronics lasting longer.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.920]   If you have a cell phone with a replaceable battery,
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.200]   you couldn't put a second battery in.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.640]   And it's good for the environment.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.360]   Shouldn't we start demanding, not thinner and lighter,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.640]   but removable batteries and recycling?
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.240]   First of all--
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   I'll go ahead.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.200]   Oh, Dr. In the third.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.400]   First of all, I hate this new laptop.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.520]   I hate this new direction that Apple is going into.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.800]   They're not going into the Pro Series
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.720]   when people used to create content.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.240]   Now they want to do a Pro Series for you to consume content.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.040]   Yeah, this is basically an iPad with a keyboard.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.080]   That's so well put.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.000]   Can you just repeat that?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.160]   Oh, Dr. I want to do a church key.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.400]   Repeat that.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.600]   Precho, Dr.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.280]   So first of all, I'm going to just go and then I'm going to stop.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.480]   You make a laptop with only C ports in it,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.000]   and then you put a headphone jack in it.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.840]   After you just told me that you were magically
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.160]   getting rid of my headphone jack
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.920]   that I tried to put in this iPhone 7 Plus repeatedly.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.000]   Now why is it in that?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.360]   And you can't have a way for me to just plug my phone
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.440]   into my laptop and charge it when I'm on the go.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.640]   And I got stuff to do.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.600]   And instead, now I have to pull out this dongle.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.760]   It looked like a doofus.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.760]   But you couldn't put an SD card reader in it
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.280]   because you told me aerodynamics.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.440]   I'm thinking this dongle is aerodynamic.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.720]   Everything is wrong with this thing.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.560]   You told me-- have you just seen it--
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.240]   I got it with a little scroll bar?
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.320]   No, no, I'm not done.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.280]   Did you see that it was a stupid little scroll bar?
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.840]   I got-- any professional knows how to use the function keys
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.680]   to get around any of these pro tools that they're using.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.880]   It's so insane the things that they're doing.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.280]   I never miss Steve Jobs.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.240]   I thought to myself, he's a man I never met.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.560]   I don't need him.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.640]   But I miss him so much because it's so ridiculous
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.080]   the stupid stuff that they're doing.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.560]   And if you wanted my grandma to have a MacBook Pro
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.920]   then maybe you shouldn't charge $3,000 for you.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.360]   It's stupid, a doofus.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   I don't need it.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.160]   And it makes me so mad because I need a new computer
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.520]   and I'm have to go back to Microsoft
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.960]   because they're the only ones I've ever been in.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   Did you see that sexy 28 inch tablet that you've been
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.240]   running, spooning out and right on with--
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.760]   where is Apple's innovation?
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.840]   Y'all ain't got no magic, y'all ain't got no courage.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.200]   I'ma stop yelling because people get mad
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.280]   because they're yelling at the show.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.240]   But I hate it so much and it makes me so--
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   You know that?
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.560]   Please, Leo, Leo, don't--
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.120]   we need a moment.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.200]   We just need a moment of silence to appreciate
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.080]   the Bill Cosby mixed with Homer Simpson, Rand,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.280]   and we just heard--
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   Oh my god.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   That was the most beautiful thing I've heard on this show
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.000]   in years.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.960]   Oh, Dr. I want to find you and hug you,
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   but I know you're in a non-disclosed black site.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.280]   I'll bring it back to the city for you.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.320]   I'm sorry, I don't want to find you.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.880]   That was amazing.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.560]   Dude, it hurts my heart.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.400]   I need to spend three Gs on the laptop
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.040]   and I can't bring myself to do it.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.560]   I need one and I can't do it right now because I'm so upset.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.200]   And I don't want to go back to Microsoft.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.960]   I dumped her a long time ago.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.200]   But now she out here looking sexy,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   they'll put on a cute dress and lost 50 pounds.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.480]   So--
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.120]   I have no words.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.800]   Amazon's red-abuddest monk service causes controversy.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.480]   Is that an actual headline?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.960]   Welcome to Mashable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.400]   No, it's a real story because apparently it's
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.760]   very expensive to get a Buddhist monk for your memorial
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.680]   service.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.480]   Monk delivery service from a temple is about $830.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.200]   A funeral could be as much as $8,500.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.600]   So Amazon has jumped in to this market with cut-rate Buddhist
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.080]   monks.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   This is monk service.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.560]   So it's not that you're renting a restaurant.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.200]   The name of the service is Mr. Monk Delivery.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.160]   Mr. Monk Delivery.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   Mobo Sandin.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.440]   Is there a Mrs. Monk delivery?
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.160]   No, there are no Mrs. Monks.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.240]   You know what you're saying?
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:33.720]   Trash.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.360]   Apparently, this is a big money maker
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.320]   for Japanese Buddhist temples.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.280]   So they did a lower price.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.440]   The Japanese Buddhist Association is up in ours.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.120]   But you know what?
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.200]   As they should be, it is terrible.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.120]   You told me how to do it.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.640]   Acceptance.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.200]   Acceptance.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.640]   The Amazon service is a mere $300.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.600]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   They're going even lower.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.320]   There's the Amazon B6 monk, which are like--
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.640]   They speak in the same case.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.120]   --the same case for the--
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.280]   --with frustration for your rabbit.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.640]   It's just like the Amazon cables.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   It's the same as the lightning cable from Apple Store.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   It's just like half the third of the price.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.560]   You want to take gold-plated monster
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.680]   monk as a service, which costs $10 trillion.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.720]   Exactly.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   Huh?
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.280]   And either way--
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.240]   Oh, that's what we need is the Amazon dash button for a monk.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.200]   For a monk.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.440]   What are a monk?
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.720]   At some point times, we ate people outside like you called.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.600]   And we're going to be like, crap, Leo, get your credit card out.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.080]   Either way, about 100 people listening right now.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.920]   Just had their--
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   Say, I'm going to talk to you about--
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.520]   I said a timer for five minutes.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.120]   Stop it.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.960]   Buy more socks.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.560]   You know how annoying that is?
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.600]   Oh, that's really bad.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.280]   Play Barry, man.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:37.800]   Hello.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.440]   You are dying.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.680]   Playing blood by sleigh.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.120]   We're going to bleep this whole damn segment.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.120]   Oh, hey.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   Can you just--
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   I love Alexa.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.120]   --get these boys out of here.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   Tell us a joke.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.640]   Leo's hair color.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.160]   No, no.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.680]   If you do-- tell me a joke.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.480]   He does it.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.520]   He'll also do other stuff.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.680]   Like--
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.840]   You can say fart.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.440]   You have to turn it on.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:05.960]   Oh, you do.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   But it's one of the skills.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.640]   It's a section called skills.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.160]   Ah.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   It's one of the--
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   --turn on fart and then--
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.000]   --something like that.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   Turn on the fart.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.880]   My favorite rock feature is the Switch accounts.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.760]   So if you can put two accounts in--
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.280]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:21.760]   --so it's like--
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.480]   It's amazing.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.000]   So like--
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   My wife has her audible books on--
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.720]   Exactly why I did it.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.600]   And so we swap accounts.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.680]   And when I wanted to read my book,
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.040]   and when she wants to read her book--
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.120]   my daughter goes, play rock and roll music
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.400]   that'll make daddy angry.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.920]   And I'm like--
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.520]   Is it work?
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.720]   I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.560]   There's no rock and roll.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.060]   It's heavy.
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:36.560]   I love rock.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.960]   Play like some smooth jazz or something.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.440]   I don't make this.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.200]   This is why kids today have such a problem.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.680]   Because their parents--
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.400]   They love all the stuff.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.360]   You want to tie your hair purple and make a mohawk?
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.920]   Go for it.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.960]   That's wonderful.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.120]   Play Rick Ashley.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.920]   Never going to give you up.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.760]   Ashley.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.680]   I'm just from the chat room.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.040]   Shout out to--
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.040]   Or just the rest of the group.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.560]   You just rip roll.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.520]   Shout out to the geek, oh, seven.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.200]   Just Rick rolled everybody listening to.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   It is the greatest device ever.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.720]   It is.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.680]   It's one of my favorite--
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.640]   My favorite devices ever.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.160]   My favorite device is here.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.200]   I think it's the best device they've ever made.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.680]   When the government breaks a lock
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.520]   and they're doing it in the physical world,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.880]   that is one lock.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.320]   It's constrained by the--
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.000]   If you want to take an example of a golden key,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.840]   like if you want to like the TSA luggage,
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.120]   bruja, TSA--
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.240]   Now luggage has to have a TSA approved lock,
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.160]   which can be unlocked by a particular set of keys
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.000]   that only the TSA has.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.880]   And then someone stupidly took a picture of it
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.680]   and put it on Twitter.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.960]   And now you can 3D print the key that can unlock,
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.480]   basically, all the luggage in the world.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.960]   It's a great example of the problem with golden keys
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.840]   that they do leak.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.040]   And when they do leak, then now everyone
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.840]   has accessed--
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.880]   Every single luggage lock in the world
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.880]   was weakened immediately, all at the same time.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.560]   The difference is you still have to get the key
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   and go to every piece of luggage and unlock it one by one
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.080]   by one by one.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.480]   There's a physical constraint on what
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.240]   can be done with a golden key.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.600]   The real danger with a digital golden key
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.200]   and this idea that there--
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.880]   I mean, the only way that you could build a--
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.480]   The only way you could fulfill this law,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.120]   the only way is that Apple has or Google or WhatsApp
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.920]   or any service, Amazon.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   And this, again, this applies to basically every single company
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.320]   that's in the internet, period.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.080]   That every single company has to retain
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.760]   a key that can undo their encryption.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.320]   But the difference is when and if that key leaks
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.400]   and these things do leak.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.360]   And again, you don't design for the best case.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.480]   You design for the worst case.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.520]   So you presume what happens if this key leaks.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.080]   If this key leaks, not only is every single piece of software
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.960]   and every service and everything that that touches
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.680]   immediately vulnerable, but it's vulnerable in a way
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.480]   that can be taken of advantage of immediately and at scale.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.080]   Because that's how digital works.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.120]   Like some bad guy in some Eastern European company
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.280]   or in Russia or China or in the US or wherever
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.440]   it may be can immediately compromise
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.320]   and take advantage of that weakness in a matter of minutes.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.000]   And that's very different than having
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.920]   to go to every single piece of luggage in the airport
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.120]   and lock them one by one.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.040]   Like the degree of risk is massively, massively greater
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.760]   and you put that in an equation where figure out
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.520]   who has the most to lose?
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.240]   Who has the most to keep secure?
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.920]   If you did a census of every single country
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.760]   and every single citizen and every single company
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.280]   in the world, who has the most to lose?
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.960]   And if you put this in a ledger and you weigh it out
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.480]   and you balance it out, it comes out that the United States
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.360]   has the most to lose of any single country in the world.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.240]   And instituting in environment where
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.320]   you're hoping, basically your security rests on hoping
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.840]   that stuff doesn't leak or doesn't get out.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.080]   Which the history of everything shows never persists
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.720]   and over the arc of time will get out.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.760]   That's what happens.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.000]   And that's why you design security for the worst case.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.280]   You don't design it for the best case.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.920]   So when and if that happens, who will be decimated?
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.880]   It will be us, it will be the US.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.640]   And that's the argument that we need to win on.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.520]   Not calling the medians, even though they are.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.520]   Yeah, I know.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.840]   It's tremendously satisfying to call these people wankers,
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.680]   but you're right to advance the conversation
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.160]   in a way, shape or form.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.440]   You said on Twitter you were going to,
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.840]   "I don't know why."
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.240]   (laughing)
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.680]   You baited him into it, you made him do it.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.080]   You just, yeah.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.680]   I would love though to ask Senator Feinstein,
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.320]   "What's your thinking here?"
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.920]   Now remember, these two are ranking members
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.920]   of the Intelligence Committee.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.440]   Maybe they know something, you know?
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.640]   Maybe they, and they probably do have a good reason
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.240]   to be very worried and think that,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.520]   "Well, you really need to do something about this."
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.520]   Yeah, I mean, I'm sure they're being told
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.320]   by the Intelligence agencies that they are going dark.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.360]   But we seem to forget that before smartphones,
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.520]   we did have a pretty good record of catching criminals.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.720]   You know, it wasn't impossible.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.000]   When we do before phones, yeah.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.760]   I mean, we've had encryption now for,
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.720]   decent encryption for decades,
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.120]   and we're still catching criminals.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.440]   There are still stupid people out there.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.440]   It's just, it's that mindset that this will make
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.720]   law enforcement's life easier,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.840]   therefore we should do it,
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.400]   and we should ignore the consequences.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.680]   And as you say, the consequences of this
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.240]   are absolutely huge.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.760]   If the government's OPM department can't keep it,
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.320]   senior fingerprints and security clearance is safe,
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   if Microsoft can lose its source code,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.560]   if Google can suffer serious outages,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.800]   you know, I mean, there is no way to keep
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.600]   an S-Grouse system key safe.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.000]   And if you're going to introduce a deliberate flaw
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.160]   into the encryption,
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.240]   China, Russia, Malwell writers will do a Manhattan project
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.040]   to find out what that is and to exploit it.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   Yeah, just to be clear,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.560]   you can design a golden key that cannot be discovered.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.680]   I mean, it's a, like,
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.920]   the problem is the golden key Ken and Will leak,
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.800]   or Ken will be discovered.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.120]   I don't have, actually that is one thing Google mentioned
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.600]   that I think is terrible.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.720]   You know, they've got their own now Amazon Echo clone,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.200]   they'll be out the Google hello someday
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.760]   in the not too distant home rather,
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.640]   aloe home.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.920]   And one of the things,
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.320]   one I think was somebody said, I think it was Google,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.120]   I envision a day where you have a bunch of these
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.840]   on your mantle and you're talking to all of them.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.520]   No, that is not the day I envision.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.360]   I do not want that.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.640]   I want one thing.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.680]   I talk to that one thing, it talks to everything else.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.840]   That's what we want.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.880]   I want Scarlett Johansson in her.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.400]   Yeah, the other problem with the aloe idea is
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.160]   that you're inserting an agent into, like,
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.440]   one-on-one conversations.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.320]   That was one of their demos,
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.840]   where you're like, hey, to your significant other.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.320]   It would answer for you.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.160]   Yeah, or you would bring it in to schedule
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.400]   your dinner reservations or something.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.160]   And I saw that and I thought, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.920]   When I have a conversation with one other person,
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.280]   I do not want to bot in between us, right?
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.200]   Oh, maybe, though.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.880]   Wait a minute, though.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.760]   Maybe there's people that you, you know,
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.840]   bug you and you could just say, okay, aloe, handle that.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.280]   Talk to the bot.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.520]   You don't even tell him.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.760]   You just say aloe handle it.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.520]   'Cause, you know, inbox has this great auto answer thing.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.600]   I've been using that more and more.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.760]   It looks at the email.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.360]   It learns how you respond to things.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.240]   And it's uncanny.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.560]   It comes up with responses I actually use almost all the time.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.040]   A lot of times I'll write more.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.440]   But if aloes like that,
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.480]   I can only imagine that my wife and I started discussion
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.720]   and then it ends up aloes talking to itself.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.000]   (laughing)
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.240]   Where'd this new calendar?
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.080]   Honey?
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.920]   (laughing)
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.360]   Are you still talking to me on that?
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.280]   No, I'm not.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.360]   I'm not either.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.200]   What are they saying?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.560]   They're having a conversation.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.640]   I think they like each other.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.040]   Google thinks we should go out to dinner.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.440]   (laughing)
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.400]   Yeah, magic.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.640]   Calendar, just, I've scheduled something for you.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.920]   I'm telling you, Skynet, it's coming.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.600]   Facebook, of course, working on AI as well.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.280]   I think Facebook and Google do have an advantage
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.760]   in that we've already given them so much
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.080]   of our personal information
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.720]   that they at least know my name.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.160]   Siri is a little bit of disadvantage there.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.680]   Facebook is starting to do digital vision,
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.760]   artificial intelligence.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.680]   Both Facebook and Google have open sourced
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.640]   a lot of the code that they're using,
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.680]   hoping that others will work with their code
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.280]   and start improving it.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.560]   This is kind of the benefit of open source.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.600]   The disadvantages you're giving away company secrets.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.320]   The advantage is if you've got cool stuff,
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.360]   like TensorFlow from Google,
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.960]   people will start using that.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.320]   And then we'll all benefit.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.480]   Worried about Skynet?
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   Are we getting closer?
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.680]   Saying you said there was nothing going on.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   But this is the story that's going on.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.960]   No, but Harry said it was AI.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.960]   And I think you're right.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.520]   But both of you are right.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.680]   It's distant.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.960]   It's not right now.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.200]   Except that this could be the iPhone in 2007.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.720]   Well, I mean, we're gonna keep using it
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.640]   and we'll complain about it.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.920]   And we won't even notice how much better it gets
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.640]   because it's still not quite good enough.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.320]   And then one day it will be,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.640]   we'll just wake up and be like,
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.000]   oh, it's good enough now.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.760]   Or the world will end and it'll be Skynet.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.600]   One of those.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.200]   - Allo will have incognito chats.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.440]   It'll have, everybody does this now,
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.000]   expiring messages.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.880]   Everybody's also doing encryption,
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.800]   a point to point encryption.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.720]   In Allo's case, as well as Facebook's,
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   you'll have to opt in to it.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.560]   It's not default.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.400]   Apples is default.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.720]   - Yeah, that's the thing that the security people ding
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.840]   Allo for is that you have to go into secret mode
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.720]   as opposed to just having everything being.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.200]   - At least you have a secret.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.480]   - Yeah, it's good that they've got one.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.760]   It's just, by default, it's not secret.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.160]   And that's because Google wants to be able to do its thing
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.400]   and process what you're saying
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.320]   and come in with a bot to help you out.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.560]   - Unlike Apple, they're gonna use
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.840]   a well-known open source solution,
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.360]   the Signal Protocol, which is vetted and tested.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.960]   Won't have the problem messages has.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.880]   Unique keys for every participant.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.160]   Of course, your assistant won't work anymore now
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.120]   'cause you're encrypted, but that's it.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.200]   That's the trade-up.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.520]   - And that's why it's not on by default.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.360]   - Right.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.660]   I completely think that's fine.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.440]   'Cause most of the conversations you have in messaging
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.200]   do not need to be secret.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.400]   Honey, what's for dinner?
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.920]   - It's a secret.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.760]   - Yeah.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.200]   - Why are you trying to find out what my dinner is?
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.040]   - Am I, yeah.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.720]   (laughing)
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.560]   - No, true.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.280]   I think the idea there is that then out of habit,
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.600]   you always do your things unencrypted
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.840]   and therefore there's always been that argument, right?
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.680]   Back in the days of everybody doing PGP email
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.560]   that you should encrypt everything.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.680]   Or HTTPS instead of HTTP on the web.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   If you encrypt everything, then--
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.520]   - Everybody's happy.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.360]   - Then everybody's happy.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.320]   - Pan is not a red flag to the NSA.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.160]   - Saying.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.000]   - You must be up to no good
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.920]   'cause you just turned on encryption.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.040]   Yeah, I use PGP.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.480]   I sign everything.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.320]   And if somebody sends me their keys,
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.520]   then by default, our conversation will be encrypted.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.120]   They're by making sure that we're,
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.440]   every conversation will be in the NSA database.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.760]   - Yep.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.920]   - I know, you know what?
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.760]   Who cares?
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.760]   'Cause it's just as dopey a conversation
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.240]   under the encryption as it would be
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.640]   if it weren't unencrypted.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.040]   - So one of the tough things for us to deal with
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.200]   this year on a Twit was politics.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.760]   We don't a political show, we're a technology show,
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.640]   but there has been all year long,
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.080]   kind of an intersection of tech and politics.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.760]   This was shortly after the election.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.240]   We had Lauren Hockinson and Alex Wilhelm on,
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.840]   along with Mike Elgin.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.880]   And frankly, I had just had enough.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   This was my response to Trump's latest tweet.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.720]   Watch.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.680]   - This also wonderfully dovetails into the fact
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.520]   that all of this, especially in relation to the way
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.320]   that tech companies are seeing,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.640]   especially the internet as a common carrier,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.960]   could be radically affected within the next four years.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.160]   - Are you talking about neutrality?
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.000]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.840]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.680]   - Oh, net neutrality.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.200]   - Tom Wheeler, stop.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.120]   'Cause this is a second conversation we can't have,
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.520]   which is what a Trump administration will look like to tech.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.040]   My reluctance to get into that is it's an unknown.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.520]   And we can say what he said in the campaign.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.000]   I think he's already backpedaling on some things.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.920]   In many cases, he said inconsistent things
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.080]   about a lot of things, H1B visas.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.920]   I'm not sure what his policy is
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.400]   'cause it's not written on his website
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.160]   and his public statements have been inconsistent.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.880]   I mean, the guy was a Democrat three years ago.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.920]   We don't really know what is gonna happen.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.960]   Of course, one hopes that the most misogynistic
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   racist things that he said and encouraged were
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   inappropriate rhetoric that he will abandon,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.800]   but we don't know.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.680]   So what I'd like to do, and maybe that's wrong,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.280]   but what I'd like to do is defer judgment
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.000]   until such time as he says what his policy is.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.440]   - I think that's reasonable,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.840]   but given the people that he's bringing into his
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.680]   - All it does is he gets it.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.080]   - It just gets people ginned up over something
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.160]   that hasn't happened yet.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.240]   - Okay, but can we frame it like this then?
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.680]   Given that Trump is now the head of the GOP,
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.240]   he's their actual leader.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.560]   - Well, he's actually, I would argue with it.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.480]   - Hold on.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.400]   - I don't know who the head of,
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.800]   I don't even know what the GOP is in.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.680]   - The standard, he's just made you the staff.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.160]   - The standard bearer is--
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.320]   - He's the president elect.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.160]   - He wins.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.280]   - It's not a parliamentary system where the head
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.760]   of the party is now the prime minister.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.120]   - The nominee of the party is generally regarded
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.920]   as the head of the party.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.360]   - And I think you're right,
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.720]   and I think this is a new era,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.040]   and I don't know if we can say that.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.120]   - All I'm trying to say is,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.960]   if we--
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.760]   - I think it's very likely that mainstream Republicans
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.800]   will reject what he does in office.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.680]   - That's a possibility,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.360]   but I do think when he comes to policy things,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.800]   we've been on the books of GOP dictates for a long time,
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.760]   we can look to them as a preamble of what he may do.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.280]   - No, I don't think you can, I don't think you know.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.040]   - Kids, was that too far?
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:24:59.960]   - No, I think that's too far.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.520]   I think it's a complete mystery.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.800]   I can guarantee you the Republican establishment is going.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.640]   - Okay, so--
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.680]   - What's he gonna do?
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.640]   - Let me try it one more time.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.800]   There was a story that came out about two days ago
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.000]   reporting on the first meeting between technology
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.440]   and business leaders in the tech sector
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.720]   and the Trump transition team,
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.280]   and they discussed how the approach policy
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   in the Trump administration
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.600]   is that close enough to be an accurate talk about?
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.440]   - Yeah, but that one, no,
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.200]   because that's a discussion.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.320]   I would like to see actual actions,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.160]   and then I'm, believe me, I'll take to the streets.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.840]   I don't have a problem with protesting actual actions.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.160]   I have a little bit of a problem with
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.600]   protesting something that hasn't happened yet.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.360]   - I think Ajit Pai is probably next in line
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   to be terminally SEC.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.040]   - That probably doesn't matter, we don't know.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.680]   Wait until that happens, will you?
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.840]   - No, 'cause I wanna gear up now.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.000]   - Easy for you to say.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.200]   - Yeah, not 59.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.080]   - You're gonna be on the show and that happens.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.280]   - Can I say, can I say, can I just find yourself
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.280]   an ulcer over something that might happen?
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.680]   - Absolutely, and I will take an ulcer,
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.520]   I'll take it twice.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.960]   - Allow me to stuff into the batting cage for a minute.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.880]   Sorry, I'm gonna tag in here.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.160]   And I think that this is something that we can discuss,
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.240]   which is, are you ready?
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.080]   - Yes.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.280]   - Which is the idea.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.120]   - No.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.960]   (laughing)
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.800]   - Stop it.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.640]   (laughing)
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.320]   - So, Trump has gone on record to say that he opposes
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.280]   the FCC's Open Internet Order.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.160]   This is something that he said.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.080]   But he just lets it--
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.320]   - He said, okay, wait a minute.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.000]   He said it in a tweet.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.840]   - And he said it.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.520]   - In which he said it's compared it to the equal,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.440]   what was it, the FCC rule for equal media access.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.280]   Fairness doctrine.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.360]   - Yes, the fairness doctrine.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.200]   - That was in a tweet two years ago.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.160]   I don't know if he still thinks that,
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.360]   if that's what he's gonna do.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.240]   And I think debating Donald Trump's tweet
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.040]   is an exercise in fertility.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.600]   - Okay, what I was going to say is,
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.280]   what I was going to say is, however,
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.680]   he seems to also feel sympathetic towards net neutrality
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.240]   in the sense that his interpretation
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.600]   of the Open Internet Order was actually a knock
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.120]   against in high net neutrality.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:53.960]   - It's confusing.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.800]   I know.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.280]   - He's also said he wants to end the time Warner
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.040]   acquisition by AT&T.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.880]   - Yeah.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.760]   - So, what have we got?
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.600]   We don't know.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.720]   Let's wait and see.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.400]   I'll bet you.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.440]   Well, I'll bet you, but it doesn't,
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.360]   you can't debate something he might do.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.520]   That's, you can't.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.480]   There's nothing to debate.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.080]   - Well, I mean, we can talk about it.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.520]   - I think it would be a good thing if he stopped AT&T
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.320]   time Warner.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   I think it would be a bad thing if he over,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.080]   or if he appointed somebody in the FCC
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.560]   who would overturn the net neutrality.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.000]   We can say that, but we don't know.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.840]   He hasn't done it yet.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.200]   - Let's talk about what has happened.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.000]   This is a complete shift, and I hope you don't mind
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.840]   about this.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.960]   In 2008, eight years ago, I wrote a column
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.400]   that flatly, I had come to the conclusion
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.360]   that social media determines elections.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.720]   At that time, President Obama's running for office,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.160]   and I said, he's got more juice on social media.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.080]   He's going to win, and he won.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.360]   And then every major election since then,
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.680]   I've looked at the social media,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.200]   number of followers, the amount of engagement, et cetera.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.200]   And in 100% of the cases in major elections,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.120]   whoever has the most juice on social media wins.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.720]   - And clearly, this one wasn't even close.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.560]   - Wasn't even close.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   This one, Donald Trump is for whatever--
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.400]   - Master of the media.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.640]   - Master of the media.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.840]   And so here's the question, does social media
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.720]   simply determine, is success on social media
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.040]   how you get elected?
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   - I think it's simplistic to say it's that thing
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.400]   or another thing.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.520]   You can also say he was very good at getting mainstream media
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.680]   to cover him because he was so good for ratings,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.000]   and they got billions of dollars in free television coverage.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   You could also say, you could say a lot of things.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.840]   - reality TV.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.560]   - Yeah, I don't think we should oversimplify.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.720]   I'd see a lot of this.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.160]   - Well, it's all Comey's fault or it's all Bernie's fault.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.080]   And you know what, it's a lot of things.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.120]   And I don't know if anybody will ever know what was the reason.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.480]   It could well be that Hillary Clinton was just not likable.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.600]   And it could well be that, well, we've had eight years
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.200]   of a Democrat, it's time for a Republican,
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.800]   which by the way happens with regularity.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.120]   I don't know what it is.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.680]   - But we can agree that CNN shouldn't have played
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.920]   so many Trump rallies in prime time, unencumbered by commercial.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.880]   - Certainly helped him.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.760]   - Certainly helped and helped them by the way.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.040]   And Les Moonves, chairman of CBS.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.800]   - No, but Zucker said that he was,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.640]   that they should have done that.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.720]   So, Zucker's only moment of contrition
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.440]   following the election was that.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.440]   And I think that's kind of a telling lack of self-awareness.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.000]   - Les Moonves, chairman of CBS,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.240]   says it may not be good for America,
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.140]   but it's damn good for CBS.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.200]   - Actually buy some stock.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.400]   - To read about the new Uber,
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.600]   I guess this is in New York,
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.200]   mostly, is it called?
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.600]   - Oh, right, the local one.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.400]   - Yes, Juno, what is the new one?
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.480]   - Yeah, something like that.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.320]   - Yeah, because--
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.760]   - I should try that tomorrow.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.920]   - Yeah, you're going to New York.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.040]   So there was a Good New Yorker article about them,
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.400]   and Baratunde told me about him.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.240]   He says, "I don't use Uber anymore
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.880]   because it's exploitative.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.000]   I want to use Juno."
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Now, Juno is started by the guys who started,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.280]   they sold Viber, they started Viber, remember that?
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.320]   They sold over $900 million.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.240]   So the founder, Tom and Marco,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.880]   said he thought, "Well, I could sit around
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.400]   and just enjoy life."
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.160]   Or, "I could take some of that money
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.440]   and start another company."
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.800]   He looked around and he said,
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.880]   "We could do what Uber's doing better."
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.520]   Now, they're kind of cannibalizing Uber
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.960]   because they're going after Uber drive,
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.280]   the best Uber drivers.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.320]   If your Uber score,
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.640]   your rating on Uber is over,
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.040]   this is something out of a Black Mirror episode.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   If your Uber score is over 4.7 out of five stars,
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.400]   you can apply to drive for Juno.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.760]   In other words, if you're one of the best,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.400]   they'll steal you away.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.280]   Although many drivers do both.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.880]   - And you get a higher percentage, right?
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.360]   - Yeah, Uber takes five to 25% commission,
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.440]   Juno takes 10%.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.360]   And what's happening with a lot of Uber drivers
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.200]   are getting squeezed.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.880]   It started out great, and then Uber takes more
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.200]   and more and more.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.320]   I took an Uber the other day, we were in Florida,
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.560]   and I tried to give the guy a tip.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.160]   He says, "No, the company doesn't let me take tips."
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.640]   And I said, "Oh, my friend, you are so wrong."
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.000]   - They don't let you tip within the app like Lyft does.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.120]   - They pretend that you're getting tipped.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.360]   I always assumed Uber was tipping the driver,
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.600]   and they told drivers you may not ask for a tip
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.560]   until the driver's sued and won.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.400]   - Yeah, that's the tip.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.640]   - And now Uber drivers can ask for tips.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.440]   I told them, "Not only are you allowed to take tips,
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.400]   "you can now ask for tips,
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.480]   "and don't believe what the Uber guy's telling you."
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.920]   - No, Uber has a long record of treating his drivers
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.160]   terribly badly. - That's exploitive.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.520]   - They're on the record of saying that basically,
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   they're just hanging around until the automated car
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.640]   comes out and they're just going to dump all these drivers.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.480]   - Five-by-draming rays.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.840]   - So, it's not a company I'd like to do.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.880]   - Lyft allows you to tip within the app,
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.760]   and what I like about that is I'll tip after I get out
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.600]   of the car.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.480]   When I'm at the end of a ride,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.320]   what I like about Uber and Lyft is I can just get out
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.160]   of the car and leave.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.680]   I don't have to fiddle with my wallet.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.280]   But I kind of feel bad, because I do like to tip
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.680]   if I get good service.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.640]   But Lyft lets you do that at any point after the ride, though.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.920]   - I felt guilty because I have never tipped Uber drivers,
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.480]   assuming that I didn't have to.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.720]   - I know, and I don't carry cash.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.360]   One of the reasons that I really like Uber
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.320]   is that I don't need to worry about having cash for a tip.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.640]   - Ever since that court case,
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.720]   I have now automatically tipped.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.040]   I carry cash.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.920]   And then maybe you should try it.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.720]   So, Larry, when you're in the Big Apple, try Juno.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.560]   - Try Juno.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.480]   - So, in fact, tomorrow morning, I've got a 6 a.m. flight,
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.400]   and I don't trust Uber or Lyft to actually have a driver
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.960]   in my neighborhood available to pick me up at 4.30.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.120]   So, Lyft now lets you schedule.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.040]   I actually have Lyft reserved.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.200]   I think I'm paying a little extra for that.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.480]   But it's a relief to know that a driver will be there
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.320]   at 4.30 in the morning.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.640]   And I don't have to worry about what it was.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.360]   - It is nerve-wracking, isn't it, that you could just assume,
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.800]   "Well, I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna press a button
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.960]   "and the guy will come within five minutes at 4.30
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.320]   "in the morning, maybe, maybe not."
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.680]   And you don't want to miss that flight.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.920]   - Palo Alto, nobody in the right mind will be trying
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   to go to the corner.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.400]   (laughing)
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.280]   - Yeah, that's the thing, even with Juno and Lyft,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.080]   I worry about in a few years, it's clear that all of these
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.080]   companies want to do autonomous vehicles.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.920]   - Oh yeah.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.720]   - Yeah, I mean, these jobs are not gonna exist in five minutes.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.440]   - Then you'll pay extra for the human touch, right?
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.040]   That'll be like an extra fancy, you know,
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.120]   our driver knows the way to go.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.280]   But it will push the bottom, what, 90%?
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.400]   80% of the driver's out of the market.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.960]   - Exactly. - Eventually.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.280]   - Yeah, and considering that driving
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.600]   is one of the most, I think about three and a half,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.600]   four million Americans are now--
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.680]   - One point, one of the other forces--
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.000]   - A professional driver's out of the car.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.840]   - Wow, that's a good truck driver.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.760]   - Yeah, it's a huge number that's gonna have to--
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.280]   - And truck drivers are gonna be usually impacted by it
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.000]   because that's one of the areas that might actually
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   get covered sooner because it's so much more efficient
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.800]   to not have people, you know, human beings
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.600]   who have to do things like sleep and eat.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.640]   - Yeah, well, we saw it just a few weeks ago,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.080]   Auto, O-T-T-O, which is an Uber company,
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.760]   delivering, what was it, 7,500 cases of beer?
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.720]   - Well, Budwas, it's like calling it a beer is a beer.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.560]   - No, of course. - Strong, you know.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.560]   - Right, I was cool. - Well, you know,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.360]   oh, without making a poo, you know.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.200]   (laughing)
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.040]   - You wanna have-- - No, I was Budwas.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.360]   - You want the beer in the robot truck
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.880]   to be something you could lose in the world.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.440]   - Yeah, exactly. - And it's important.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.200]   - So I don't, I wasn't gonna get into this today
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.840]   'cause this is kind of a deep and difficult
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.200]   to understand a parsed topic, but it is very clear
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.480]   that income inequality is a growing problem.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.640]   That's clear, right?
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.320]   - And the hollowing out of industry is right.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.600]   - And jobs are going away.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.360]   And I, you know, even if you are able to get carrier air
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.840]   conditioner to stay in the United States,
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.920]   it seems highly unlikely that industrial jobs
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.280]   that have been lost will come back at any point.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.280]   - Right.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.160]   - You can talk about, and some do, retraining,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:51.000]   teaching people to have skills that are more in need,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.080]   but it's very clear with the advance of machine learning,
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.600]   artificial intelligence that we're rapidly getting
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.080]   to a situation where even jobs like mine
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.280]   that one would assume require human skills
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.480]   won't be available in the years to come.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   So that leaves a very interesting question.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.320]   There was an article this week in The Atlantic,
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.240]   A World Without Work.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.320]   This is Derek Thompson writing, and this is an issue
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.560]   that a lot of people are starting to think about.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.400]   Actually, I apologize.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.480]   This is a year old.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.240]   - Yeah, I've read that.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.200]   That's a really great piece though.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.160]   This is one of those issues that, you know,
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.160]   you have this, our economy in some ways
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.280]   has never been more efficient, but it comes,
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.600]   but it's employing fewer people.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.920]   And that's the challenge is if you lose another 1%
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   of the workforce, are they going to--
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   - Where's it going?
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.480]   - Robot Trump's probably not.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.200]   - I think Donald Trump is gonna get his campaign,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.560]   eventually, maybe not during his administration,
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.520]   he will fulfill his campaign promise
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.000]   of bringing jobs back to the United States.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.920]   But the problem, I'm sorry, bringing industry
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.560]   back to the United States, not jobs.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.720]   So yes, Apple is gonna start, eventually,
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.440]   they'll start making devices in the US.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.680]   - It'll be with robots.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:03.000]   Even robots gone in China has replaced 30,000 people
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.080]   with robots.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.120]   - So right, especially if energy continues to be cheap,
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.400]   why not put a plant in the middle of the United States
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.320]   closer to the consumer if you don't have to--
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.920]   - Well, there's actually interesting economic reasons
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.440]   for Apple to manufacture in China.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.320]   It's closer to the sources and the suppliers of the pieces.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.360]   - Yeah, to the supply chain.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.160]   - It's much easier and cheaper to assemble in China.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.120]   It's not about labor, the labor addition,
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.480]   the cost of labor that would change about $5
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.560]   between making it here and making in China.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.120]   It's not about the labor cost,
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.880]   it's about the access to suppliers--
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.800]   - And being able to adjust what you get
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.640]   from the supply chain--
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.480]   - Just in time, maybe--
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.240]   - Moment by moment so that you can minimize
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.880]   your inventory and all those things.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.680]   That Tim Cook, for example, made his name.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.280]   - That's what he does, and he's a logistics.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.120]   - Yeah, he's a logistics.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.440]   - So I think that we will probably be able to reverse
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.000]   some of this, but the long-term trend is clear.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.040]   Geez, jobs are not gonna even exist in China.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.280]   I mean, it's not that these jobs are fleeing to China.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.680]   They are going to disappear thanks to automation
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.040]   and not machine learning artificial intelligence.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.040]   And that's what this article says,
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.200]   but the thing that this article wants you to think about
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.160]   is do we even need to work?
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.560]   And this is why psychologically,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.880]   it's very difficult, historically,
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.680]   we associate who we are with what we do.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.640]   Without my work, I don't know who I am.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.480]   - Yeah.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.400]   - And so psychologically, Mark Andreessen has addressed this,
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.760]   the Netscape billionaire.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.840]   He says, "You don't have to worry about income inequality,
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.520]   "you don't have to worry about job loss,
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.000]   "because there will be such a surplus,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.320]   "thanks to automation and machine learning,
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.000]   "that there will be enough to go around
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.880]   "and you actually won't need to work."
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.200]   - So we can have a first date?
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.600]   - Essentially, yeah, that's a bad word, welfare.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.440]   - It's a basic income idea.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.840]   - Yeah, the idea, and Mark is,
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.720]   now there are problems with basic income.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.560]   - Huge problems.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.400]   - Yes.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.920]   - Chief of which it replaces other entitlements
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.480]   like medical insurance that won't be covered
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.080]   in the long run by basic income.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.720]   But let's assume we could fix that discontinuity.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   If there is a surplus, maybe in the future,
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.840]   we won't need to have jobs,
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.960]   but we'll have to psychologically adjust who we as are.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.240]   - Right, and the idea of basic income,
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.560]   by the way, if you've seen the sci-fi series, The Expanse,
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.840]   they mentioned that from time to time,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.960]   it's part of the universe there,
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.800]   is that Earth is on a basic income at that point.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.160]   The idea is, you don't have to work just to survive,
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.480]   but if you want anything more,
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.640]   if you want to buy laws that don't come out of a machine
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.280]   and food that doesn't come in cubes,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.320]   then you choose to work.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.400]   And the idea there is that we could all end up
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.960]   being more productive if we can choose what we want to work on,
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.360]   and it could lead humanity to interesting places
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   instead of fighting to do just enough to survive.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.840]   It is also a bit of a utopian vision
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.240]   and this question about whether it could actually work.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.640]   - There's also the service economy,
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.480]   and by service, I don't mean just working at McDonald's,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.680]   so we had a flood in our house in July,
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.440]   and we've had workers here constantly
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.240]   for the last several months putting walls in and painting
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.920]   and doing things that cannot be done currently by machines.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.280]   - Admittedly, but-- - We're spending
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.560]   a lot of money, right?
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.920]   - Part of the problem is that these jobs may, in fact,
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   exist, but pay so little and be so grinding and grueling
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.800]   that they, in fact, don't raise you above the poverty line.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.360]   In fact, the minimum wage in the United States
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.120]   does not raise you above the poverty line.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.160]   - Right, but doing carpentry work in Palo Alto,
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.960]   at the guise that we hire, is $75 an hour.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.480]   Which, if you didn't live in Palo Alto,
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.880]   with a pretty good wage,
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.480]   I mean, the problem is to live in this area so high,
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.560]   but, I mean, what I'm saying is that there are still
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.400]   jobs out there, in fact, I think this whole whole
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.360]   automation thing that we're in right now, the IOT thing,
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.800]   requires skilled people to know what to buy,
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.040]   to know how to install it, to know how to configure it,
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.160]   and I do think that there are service jobs
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.640]   that are gonna be emerging over the next few years.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.360]   They may not last forever, but there will be
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.920]   some opportunities for people,
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.360]   and many of these jobs don't require a college education.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.080]   - Here's from this Atlantic article of last year.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.320]   The most common occupations in the US are retail sales person,
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.680]   cashier, food and beverage server, and office clerk.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.720]   These four jobs are about 10% of the labor force,
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.120]   15 and a half million people.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.720]   Each, according to an Oxford study,
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.640]   is highly susceptible to automation.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.440]   So yes, admittedly, there will be people working.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.880]   I'm hoping that podcast show host will not be eliminated
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.000]   by automation.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   However, even if you have 10% of the labor force not working,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.320]   you have to address this issue.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.360]   And I would submit that this is a clear future
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.360]   at this point.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.320]   So we really need to think about what does that mean?
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:04.000]   - The FCC is the ultimate lame duck agency at this point.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.840]   In a few weeks, January 20th, the new president will get
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.600]   to nominate a new chairman of the FCC.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.960]   In fact, Congress has already said to the FCC,
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.800]   don't do anything.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.920]   - Well, the FCC has already, yes, they stopped doing stuff.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.240]   So this must be like a leftover.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.400]   - Well, yes, and this is something,
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.560]   I mean, Tom Wheeler is banking big on net neutrality
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.680]   being his actually protecting consumers rights,
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.080]   which he's done a really good job of.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.920]   - He is not the dingo that we thought he was.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.240]   - He is not.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.560]   So yeah, this is so frustrating because this is what
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.800]   everyone said was gonna happen when we allowed zero rating.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.720]   This is not a surprise to anyone.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.560]   - Yeah.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.920]   - And oh, look, it's happening.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.920]   And AT&T in Verizon by ignoring T-Mobile
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.840]   and not going after the first mover, the weakest one in that.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.600]   - 'Cause T-Mobile started this with their
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.480]   binge on program.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.280]   - binge on and zero rating for Spotify and some things,
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.000]   which everyone's like, "Hey, free Spotify."
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.320]   We're like, "No, this is like--"
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.520]   - This is why it's so hard.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.200]   Zero rating is so hard because customers love it.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.040]   - Right.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.280]   - What they don't understand, and it's,
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.640]   I feel like I'm preaching at them when I say this is,
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.000]   it's not good for you.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   (laughs)
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.360]   - You shouldn't, I know you're not paying anything
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.000]   for listening to Spotify, but the problem is the next
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.920]   hot new exciting music service is disadvantaged.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.960]   You won't listen to them because they cost you bandwidth.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.120]   So in effect, you're telling John Ledger and T-Mobile,
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.960]   you guys get to pick who the winners are.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.120]   And we don't want T-Mobile to pick who the winners are.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.600]   We don't want AT&T to pick who the winners are.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.960]   We want the market and consumers to pick who the winners are.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.720]   Did I describe that accurately?
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.120]   - You were so good, I'm so glad I didn't have to do that
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.960]   'cause I would have just got out of time.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.400]   - Part of the problem is the term net neutrality is terrible.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.640]   - Yes.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.840]   - And I wish we could come up with a better name.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.380]   I keep thinking maybe net discrimination
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.440]   or bandwidth discrimination.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.000]   - Network freedom.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.560]   - Well, it's for freedom, but it's against discrimination.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.400]   - It's, yeah.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.240]   - Discrimination, they got that,
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.520]   they took advantage of that word
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.600]   'cause discrimination in the FCC since now
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.960]   means a lot of crazy things.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   But on this story, so AT&T with direct TV,
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.120]   that's their own service.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.880]   So they're basically like,
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.960]   "Ooh, you belong to us."
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.760]   And that's why the FCC went after them.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.160]   So with T-Mobile, T-Mobile wasn't being as egregious.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.360]   - Well, it is, it's worse.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.200]   It's worse than AT&T.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.560]   - It is way worse, yes.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.480]   - But it's not really worse because ultimately
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.040]   the whole problem is picking winners,
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.680]   whether it's you or somebody else.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.000]   And we don't know what deals T-Mobile's making
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.360]   with these companies to get zero rated.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.880]   Zero rating is it, by the way, another terrible phrase.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.760]   These phrases are chosen to obfuscate the problem.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.400]   - Because the people in their marketing departments
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.080]   are great, AT&T sponsored data.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.760]   So with this,
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.080]   I'm just, I'm so sad because AT&T,
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.160]   even if the FCC does go,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.200]   even if the FCC had the ability to go after them,
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.840]   which I don't think given the people
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.200]   who are in Trump's transition team, that's gonna happen,
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.320]   AT&T and Verizon will fight like hell
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.840]   to make sure this goes through.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.360]   And they fight the long game.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.840]   I mean, the fact that we're still talking
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.480]   about net neutrality,
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.880]   how long has it been since we've been doing net neutrality?
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.840]   Like 2008, 2009?
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.800]   I mean, before 2005 was the term was invented or?
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.840]   - I've been writing about this since day one.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.200]   And it's so nice to see two other people talk about
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:00.160]   stuff that made my head explode.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.720]   - I just signed up for the free trial of direct TV now.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.960]   And it's supposed to be a free seven day trial,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   but the, I wish I could show you.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.120]   I maybe I've hustled through this.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.320]   Oh yeah, here we go.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.720]   So this is supposed to be free,
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.840]   but and it's very confusing.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.760]   Lock it in, pay $35 every month.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.520]   Well, no, wait a minute.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.400]   I don't, should I place the continue button or no?
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.680]   What am I paying for?
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.320]   Add to plan, but I don't, it's supposed to be free.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.320]   Okay, continue.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.520]   Prepay will hook you up.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.680]   No, what?
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.000]   I'm supposed to be free.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.480]   This is free, prepay three months today.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.600]   It's free, right?
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.320]   Credit card, I'm not giving you a, what the hell?
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.480]   So this is, by the way, just in case you think,
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.720]   oh no, AT&T's nice.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.240]   They wouldn't screw anybody.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.280]   No one thinks that.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.960]   Oh, I can't continue without giving him a credit card.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.840]   Well, that's, so that's pretty common on free trial.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.920]   Total due to, wait a minute.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.040]   Total due today, $105, that's common on free trials.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.440]   Oh, that is not, that is not.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.720]   Total due today, $105, that's, wait a minute.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.840]   This is time.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:09.840]   It's time for me to make this big and to use my illustrator,
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   Total due today, $105 due today, that's not free.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:20.360]   Scroll down, I wanna see their TNC because AT&T has the best.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.080]   You are weird if you wanna see that.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.200]   Okay, well, all right.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.680]   No, that's when they're gonna tell you
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.400]   what you're paying for.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.720]   Compatible device and browser required residential customers
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.720]   only available in the US.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.280]   No, okay, so the free trial part.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.080]   Free trial, new subscribers only cancel before the end
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.920]   of trial, so we should automatically renews monthly
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.120]   at the rate effective signup minimum $35 a month.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.080]   This charge your payment method on filing to your cancel.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.880]   If you modify or cancel at any time of direct EV
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.520]   and I once canceled, you can go directly with you.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:49.840]   (mimics
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.120]   $105, how did it get to that?
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.160]   Yeah, where did that come from?
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.240]   Your seven free days will be added to the end
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.080]   of your free, wait a minute.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.640]   Your seven day will be added to the end

[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.800]   That's not free.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.440]   Yeah, that's what they count on.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.320]   That's AT&T, I love them.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.160]   There you go.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   We just need your info.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.600]   Give us your info.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.480]   Info, I want your info.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.720]   Terms and conditions.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.840]   Will they ever cease to amuse?
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.880]   All right, coming up in just a bit.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.120]   One of the most moving moments from this year on a Twitter,
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.240]   but first a word about sheets.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.800]   I know you probably don't think a lot about your bed linens,
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.080]   but let me tell you, I bet I can even remind you,
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.560]   you know that the moment when maybe it's at a hotel,
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.600]   maybe it's at home, you have a freshly made bed
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.000]   and you've got really nice sheets
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.240]   and you're tired, it's been a long day
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.120]   and you crawl into bed and you just,
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.680]   it may be one of life's greatest pleasures.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.760]   It's simple, right?
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.480]   Just go, oh, that feels so good.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.000]   I get that every single night
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.200]   'cause I have bowling branch sheets.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.000]   Bowling branch sheets are 100, I love them.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.440]   They are 100% organic cotton.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.400]   And that's one of the reasons,
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.480]   sometimes sheets are very, it's almost scratchy, right?
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.320]   Not with bowling branch,
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.280]   these salt cotton is super soft
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.520]   and it softens over time so you just,
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.560]   ah, you just feel like you're being
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.160]   pillowed by these sheets.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.720]   You'll also feel good, your conscience will be pillowed.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.240]   They use sustainable and responsible methods
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.320]   of sourcing and manufacturing.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.480]   And now normally sheets cost,
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.760]   good sheets like this cost a lot of money,
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.560]   like a thousand dollars in stores,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.560]   but bowling branch sells direct to you.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.120]   So there's no markup, there's no middleman.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.880]   So you're getting basically what is wholesale prices,
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.800]   what the department store would pay
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.360]   for the best luxury sheets.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.400]   Instead of a thousand bucks, it's a couple of hundred bucks.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.760]   And a portion of every sale goes to a fight human trafficking,
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.680]   which I think is really great.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.640]   Just check them out, thousands of five star reviews,
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.800]   articles and Forbes, The Wall Street Journal,
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.720]   Fast Company, even three US presidents.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.280]   We won't say who, but even three US presidents
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.460]   sleep on bowling branch sheets.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:26.920]   Buying betting is inconvenient,
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.640]   but they make it easy to order from home
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.280]   and receive it beautifully packaged.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.440]   And when I say beautifully, this is suitable,
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.800]   the package that I got,
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.680]   looked like it was a wedding gift.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.960]   If you wanted to give this for wedding,
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.280]   if it would be so welcome and it comes in a beautiful box
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.200]   with a big satin bow, a ribbon around it,
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.600]   it's perfectly beautifully wrapped.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.400]   And by the way, free shipping,
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.320]   you don't pay extra for the wrapping.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.840]   And you could try at risk free for 30 nights.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.600]   If you don't like it, send them back for a full refund,
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.960]   you won't want to send them back.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.280]   In fact, within 30 days, I was ordering more.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.800]   It's like, I want this all the time.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   Bowling branch, now the spelling's a little odd,
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.440]   it's like a cotton bowl.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.000]   B-O-L-L, B-O-L-L, not B-O-W-L, B-O-L-L,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.840]   and Andy, United spelling branch,
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.200]   ball and branch.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.960]   Get it, it's like a, you know, it's a cotton thing.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.800]   Bowlingbranch.com, do use promo code TWIT
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   and you'll get 50 bucks off your first set of sheets.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.640]   Bowlingbranch.com promo code TWIT,
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.920]   we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.400]   I know it's, you probably,
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.160]   I hope you got everything you asked for
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.560]   for Christmas or Hanukkah, but if you didn't,
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.000]   this is a good gift to yourself.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   And anybody who happens to join you.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.320]   Bowlingbranch.com/twit.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.080]   All right, this is, I mean,
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.200]   Twit is a lot of things.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.760]   It's always fun, of course.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.720]   Always thought provoking, I think, this show.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.000]   And sometimes it's very emotional.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.600]   Sometimes we laugh a lot, sometimes we cry.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.120]   This is a moving moment from one of our regulars,
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.680]   Owen J. J. Stone, I mentioned it before.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.940]   This was a show at Jampak Show,
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.680]   Siva Vidinath, Siva Vidinath.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.800]   And was there Jeff Jarvis, Jason Heiner from Tech Republic.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.680]   And I think at the last minute we asked Owen to join us
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.360]   because we were talking about race relations
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.920]   and things got a little heavy.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   Oh, doctor, you're my favorite guy.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.080]   You move out of the township,
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.880]   you move to Petaluma, we'll take good care of you here, all right?
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.920]   Yeah, I need to move to the state that you own
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.440]   so I can take care of things.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.560]   Here, lean in Leah, say hi.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.680]   Happy birthday, Lena, happy birthday.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.800]   He's yelling, happy birthday.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   Happy birthday, your card's in the mail.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.040]   He's sitting here with a stamp on it.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.720]   Up, happy birthday, dear.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.680]   You happy to be nine?
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.640]   Last day is an eight year old.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.640]   You know what that means?
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.480]   No, I don't.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.320]   No, neither do I.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.160]   (laughing)
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.160]   Leah, how long has your question been on?
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.880]   Leah, do we call the cops?
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.720]   No.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.920]   Okay, what do we call them?
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.760]   We don't call them.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.000]   We have a system in place where,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:05.840]   depending on what's going on,
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.720]   she calls her mother or she calls my mother.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.680]   Women, you've trained her not to call the police?
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.200]   When she's with me, yes.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.800]   And that's where my last day was gonna be.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.440]   I hope to live in a world where I don't have to teach
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   my daughter to do things.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.040]   Oh, yeah, that's gonna make me cry.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.880]   Wow.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.400]   I wanna live in a world where it's okay
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.040]   when she's with her mother to call the police,
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.360]   but I fear when she's with me.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.280]   I've been pulled over 30 times in the last two years,
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.640]   and I'm a very quote unquote friendly,
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.360]   speakable guy, but in the last four years,
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.960]   I've had three of those cops pull guns on me
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.120]   where I had to deescalate the situation,
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.200]   because they were just out of control.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.800]   And I fear that if she ever,
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.640]   something happened to me and she called the cops,
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.800]   and she had fear in her voice,
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.560]   they might show up, see her.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.120]   I'm out all the time and people think
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.760]   that I've kidnapped a little white child.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.800]   So I wouldn't want a cop to show up and her be upset
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.240]   and think that I'm the aggressor and something go wrong.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.840]   So depending on the situation, she calls her mother
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.960]   or she calls my mother,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.320]   and then they get to make the decision
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.800]   on whether the police are called or not.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.400]   And I don't like living in that world.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.320]   I don't like living in that reality.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.400]   I just want everybody to be somewhat more responsible
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   and respectable of other people's feelings.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.080]   I want black people to live.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.320]   I want police to live.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.360]   I mean, I can't say blue lives matter,
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.080]   more than black lives, but all lives matter.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.240]   But right now, it's a very dangerous time.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   And I just want people to realize
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.120]   that it's also a great time.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.560]   I'm sitting here with Uncle Leo.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.040]   You know, he don't solve my inheritance.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.440]   I plan on taking over him and in their future
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.880]   when he retires and things can be positive.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.000]   My daughter is beautiful as she is healthy
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.520]   and she is driving me crazy.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.800]   And those are all good things for me to be happy about.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.080]   So even though I'm upset, you still gotta be happy.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.200]   I just want the world to be a little bit different
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.080]   sometimes soon.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.520]   - Amen, sir. - Yes, man.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.920]   - True words, never said.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.520]   - Yes, sir. - Thank you, Owen.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.240]   - If you go from Sirius to Silly,
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.880]   Apple opened a new store in San Francisco this year
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.960]   with like its own trees, like a garden.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.800]   And I don't know what happened to me.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.400]   But I kind of lost my mind.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.480]   Watch.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   - We sent somebody down to shoot some video of it.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   So this is their 15th anniversary store
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.360]   and they're redoing all the Apple stores.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.680]   I think they're gonna look like this.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.240]   It has a forest, a little garden grove
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.480]   inside the store.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.400]   - What are you hateful?
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.360]   What do you have again?
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.160]   - It's not a store. - It's not a store.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.480]   It's not a store.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.320]   - Leave. - They call it,
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.120]   not the genius bar, the genius grove.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.960]   - You can go out and get some free basil.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.800]   - I love it, I think it's a great idea.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   - That's what you need.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.280]   - Free basil. - This is a place
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.680]   where people can just hang out and chill.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.440]   And I think that that's what people are missing.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.840]   - This is. - People are so sick
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.360]   of buying things online with computers
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.600]   where we can actually go there
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.280]   and actually meet other people and hang out and relax
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.160]   and not have to feel any pressure,
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.840]   have some cool Apple products hanging out in the background.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.520]   You can check out the nice beautiful rose gold
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.800]   but relatively useless Macbook.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.600]   And just enjoy, there'll be music, there'll be bands,
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.960]   there'll be artisans, you can go there and have a meeting.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.920]   There'll be places where you can hang.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.160]   This is an area where we can actually deal with community
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.800]   and have Apple products in the background.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.240]   I think it's brilliant marketing
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.920]   and those 42 foot glass doors opening those up
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.800]   so that it becomes part of, it's no longer a store,
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.520]   it's just an area you can walk in
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.720]   and forget where inside is and outside is.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.440]   I think it's great marketing, that's my thought.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.440]   - Oh, Leo, Leo, Leo, you are so wrong,
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.640]   Captain, get off my lawn.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.360]   - This is technology as a lifestyle.
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.040]   This is exactly what's wrong with Apple.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.440]   - See, you don't understand the way the world works.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.720]   We live in a world where we're jaded by everything,
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.680]   digital and beefy-bopin' and you tell kids,
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.760]   don't go outside.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.320]   Well, the trick to get them to go outside
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.680]   is to bring the outside to inside the door.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.720]   - Inside the door. - To the ground inside the door.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.840]   There's trees in the place.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.400]   Have you not been into pan and seen
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.640]   bonzo trees inside of a room in the spirit
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.880]   and the essence of life in the funchway?
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.480]   You don't know about funchway.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   - I'll tell you.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.000]   - I don't want funchway, I want a guy starting computer.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.160]   I think they're selling a lifestyle that is bogus.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.440]   It's BS.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.480]   - Listen to the love of George's voice.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.720]   You can't even believe it, that's all that matters.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.560]   - I don't believe.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.400]   - All that love in George's voice,
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.480]   you can't even fight that
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.320]   with your grumpy old man, get off my lawn.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.880]   I'm bringing you a bonzo tree
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.160]   next time I come out there.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.120]   - I know, I ordered a bonzo tree.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.080]   I got the floating one on Kickstarter.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.600]   I'm fine on bonzo.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.120]   - Is it, has it arrived?
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.280]   - Not yet, probably whenever you think.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.480]   - He's just grumpy about trees,
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.320]   I want to be-
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.160]   - No, I love trees.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.040]   - I don't want to conflate trees with commerce,
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.000]   trees or trees, they should be in a forest.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.640]   Go in the forest, that's fine.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.320]   This is a store.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.520]   - Beyond just the aesthetic,
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.480]   what has changed from the experience?
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.320]   I mean, that's the large part.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.840]   - They're not selling stuff anymore.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.840]   - Right.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.320]   - That's what's changed.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.560]   They're trying to make it an app, I'm not kidding,
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.080]   I find this creepy.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.040]   They're trying to make an Apple lifestyle.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.720]   This is taking the brand too far in my opinion.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.080]   - It's a trend in the world.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.600]   If you go to Asia, they have cat and puppy shops
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.720]   where you just walk in and literally drink coffee
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.920]   when somebody's cat,
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.040]   because you want to feel things and be outside.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.200]   - And this is what you want?
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.640]   This is what you want for the world?
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.400]   - This is coming from the guy who lives in the deep.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.600]   - I wish for the hopping days of the old report
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.360]   when you used to work out of a cottage
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:17.720]   and has the spirituality and as is some of the fun.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.160]   Now you got to this big industrial warehouse
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.960]   and you think that you're on top, Mr.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.840]   when you're wrong,
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.160]   'cause I heard the love of your twins.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.480]   - I'm gonna put some trees in here
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.920]   and then you'll be visiting the Twit Forest.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.360]   You better do it and also in your will,
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.000]   put your thing as an urn as a plant.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.360]   So you can be planted as a tree
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.600]   when you die. - I love trees.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.120]   I love nature.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.920]   - I think it's that you just don't want to go to a store
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.160]   and you don't want to hang out with other people
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.280]   'cause you're done after you're not eating podcasts.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.600]   You're done with people.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.240]   - I'm gonna put my sneakers and my white running shoes
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   and my white track suit on and I'm gonna sit there
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.320]   and say I'm waiting to be taken up to Steve's land.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.600]   It's cultish, it's weird, it's creepy.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.080]   They're selling computers.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.640]   They're making, they're fetishizing this stuff.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.520]   - But I don't think so.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.400]   I think that they're giving something back to the community
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.880]   where if you have a small startup,
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.760]   you can go there and hang out and actually deal with business.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.600]   If you, you know, it's gonna have like
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.480]   a little tiny open union square thing
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.720]   where you can just sit there 24/7, not buy anything,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.520]   listen to music, have free Wi-Fi, drink your latte.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.360]   - I think that's what they want.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.280]   - They don't buy anything at all.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.680]   Yeah, it just makes it a part of the community.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.840]   It's kind of giving back.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.160]   Whereas, you know, yeah, we could say that like,
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.440]   you know, the echo where you're able to sit in your house
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.520]   and you no longer even have to leave the house
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.760]   for, you know, getting like.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.840]   - Yeah, but wait a, remember,
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.760]   we have a massive homeless problem in San Francisco.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.920]   - I was just about to say San Francisco.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.800]   - Wait a little, wait a little homeless people
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.640]   start coming in.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.080]   They gonna let them sit around new.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.880]   - Well, they just had a problem with that out here
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:44.720]   in Philly with Philly Jesus, went to an Apple store
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.040]   and apparently he went on there on a day
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.040]   when there was a new manager,
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:48.880]   somebody didn't know what was going on,
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.440]   but he goes in and charges his phone every day.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.760]   He's almost got a walk from dress like Jesus.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.840]   He has a big wooden cross.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.360]   Everybody knows him, he's harmless.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.360]   But they actually got him arrested,
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.360]   which did nothing but raise his profile
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.720]   and he got to speak to more people
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.040]   about being Philly Jesus.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.760]   To your point, I know I was yelling at you,
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.600]   I'm kind of joking.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.640]   They're doing it all to sell things and to make more money.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.880]   Yeah, it's all marketing.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.400]   I guess they're really great at marketing
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.760]   and invoking a feeling.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.600]   Like I said, if you listen to the way she was talking,
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.960]   she was pleasant and she was happy
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.160]   and it invigorated in the motion hour.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.320]   That's what they do.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.200]   And as far as letting the homeless people in,
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:25.960]   they need to, but I highly doubt they will.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.080]   - Of course they're not.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.280]   - I had that incident in my own incident with Apple and--
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   - Yeah, four runner.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.120]   - Yeah, in LA.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.520]   So Apple is, you know, they're gonna have to tip
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.120]   and throw around that because the Philly thing
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.800]   got a lot of buzz out here.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.320]   People were upset because again,
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.000]   it's something that the guy did every day
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.440]   and they actually let him go in there and charge his phone.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.680]   They didn't do anything about him.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.400]   They had to, they'd say have a time limit
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.520]   or something, how much time you can spend
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.560]   in the store if you're not doing something.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.400]   So--
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.240]   - I just think this is--
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.200]   - They probably don't unless like they probably noticed
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.800]   that he didn't look the way that they were hoping
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.640]   that he looked.
[00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.920]   - Well that's kind of my point, which is--
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.840]   - I hung out for a full day in an Apple store.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.680]   They said nothing.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.520]   - Yeah, of course not.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.840]   - It's that your welcome as long as you're part of the cult
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.680]   and you're kinda in the,
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.920]   but if you look like you're, you know,
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.000]   a little weird bye bye, I don't know.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.560]   I just feel like it's nice, all right, it's fine.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.600]   - Isn't that every store though?
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.880]   Isn't that every place you want to?
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880]   - Yeah, yeah, no, it's fine.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.080]   - If you don't have yourself put together
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.600]   to stick out or they don't want to.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.440]   - I think they don't want to.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.280]   - They don't want to.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.120]   - They don't want to.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:27.960]   - They don't want to.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.120]   - I don't know, it's a pussy well out or something.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:29.960]   I don't know.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.800]   - Yeah, they got players.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.040]   - I'm like, well look at that.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.880]   This place, it's already looking more well.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.720]   - Oh, see?
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.000]   Welcome to the Apple Grove.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.280]   - Now we feel it.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.120]   We feel it.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.360]   - But yeah, I think it's great marketing.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.000]   I think it's gonna work well for them.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.960]   I think that it's a nice idea to be able to have a store
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.720]   where it's not unwelcoming and hopefully it'll be welcoming
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.760]   to everyone I doubt that that'll be the case to that.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.240]   But yeah, I like the idea of it just being open.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.920]   You can just walk in, you don't have to worry.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.680]   It's not gonna be one of those stores where you feel like
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.520]   you go in and everyone's staring at you
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.280]   and you're not, you know, able to enter there
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.520]   and be able to just chill out.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.840]   I think it'll be great for their brand.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.360]   - And yeah, Apple doesn't do this for marketing for sure.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.360]   - Apple doesn't do that anyway.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.920]   You just, I mean, there's people always in there playing
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.480]   with games and apps and stuff and they're never really trying
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.120]   to sell you anything or help you with anything else.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.240]   You ask them 'cause there's 42 million people
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.480]   just floating about.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.560]   So it's already done.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.560]   Again, it's just something else to market for them and say,
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.840]   oh, look what we're doing now
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.240]   because you haven't come to an Apple store
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.080]   in the last three years and our numbers are down
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.200]   and we're gonna launch this new thing to get you back in.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.680]   - I dropped my three year old off
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.640]   the iPad table and I just go to work and--
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.480]   - Exactly.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.320]   - The daycare.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.240]   - Exactly, it's daycare.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.040]   Daycare for the tech app.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:38.880]   - Can we do that?
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.360]   Can we do that as a box and friends thing?
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.840]   Like just set up some go-capped, some go-pros
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.760]   and you just drop the kit off and just see how long it takes
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.960]   for their like, look,
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.400]   it's been here for four hours.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.200]   Can we got a sip of your copper something?
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.880]   Like somebody, what do we do?
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.640]   - Oh, this, oh, this, yeah, let's go.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.960]   - Let's see how long they notice.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.800]   - Four hours?
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.960]   - Yeah, I got this much screen time.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.120]   I actually, I forgot, there is one more Google thing.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.160]   What?
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.600]   - There's one more Google thing.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.320]   I do wanna mention is that they announced
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:15.040]   that Chromebooks are gonna be running the Android store soon.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.880]   - That's amazing.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.960]   - I think that's interesting.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.400]   Does that excite you Owen?
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.040]   - That pleases me to no end,
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.000]   especially like if I can use Instagram on the computer,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.480]   instead of having to use my phone,
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.560]   oh, happy day, I'm buying me a new laptop ASAP.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.320]   - It makes the Chromebook very interesting
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.400]   and they didn't mention that it's selling more now
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.680]   than they sold last quarter.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.320]   More Chromebooks were sold than Apple Macintosh's.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.360]   - Well, they're probably selling a lot of those
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.000]   to schools and things like that.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.840]   - They are, it's like, it's the number one computer
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.680]   in schools now, yeah.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.360]   - Yeah, Leah's school just got a whole new crop of them
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.800]   and they used to have the old Dell desktop things
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.320]   that were just horrible and then they,
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.880]   oh, we just bought all new Chromebooks.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.280]   So everybody's got a Chromebook now,
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.880]   so I'm sure they're killing it in the educational market.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.240]   - What is the future that Chrome has?
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.760]   - Well, I feel like this is the future.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.520]   In other words, more of the question is,
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.200]   what's the future of Android in some ways, right?
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.320]   'Cause although I guess you still need Android
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.760]   for a touch device, a phone or actually,
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.040]   you know, here's what the question is Clayton,
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.680]   what's the future for tablets?
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.160]   My wife was, Lisa was asking me this,
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.800]   is well, are they gonna still sell tablets?
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.200]   If you can get Android apps on your Chromebook,
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.720]   what do you need a tablet for?
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.800]   - Because you don't want a keyboard
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.280]   and you want the touchscreen, you want the portability.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.640]   I mean, having a Chromebook is cool enough,
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.400]   but the whole reason tablets are awesome
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.960]   is because I don't have a keyboard attached to it.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.000]   - Somebody said-- - I want to go,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.360]   I take my tablet, I don't dislodge my laptop.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.720]   Even my air, I got an air sitting right here too.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.120]   I barely even take this thing out anymore
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.280]   unless I'm traveling.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.600]   - Yeah, it's cool. - You see,
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.960]   I'm the opposite, now I don't use my tablet anymore
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.760]   because like my MacBook, it's like it's been
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.440]   and almost as light as a tablet,
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.640]   but I appreciate the keyboard.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.120]   If I have to write a long email,
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.520]   tapping on glass just does not do it for me
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.240]   and I hate having to carry the tablets.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.320]   Like they do have the light ones,
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.880]   but I liked having a trackpad.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.680]   I just want it to be able to do all of it.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.960]   I want the touchscreen, the keyboard,
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.240]   it all there and to be light and to be able to travel with it.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.200]   So now I use my tablets at all.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.040]   - Does it make a difference?
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.280]   - But you have a touchscreen on your Apple though,
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.280]   you don't have a touchscreen on your Apple.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.120]   - I know, that's when I'm waiting for it.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.280]   I'm waiting for it. - And that's what,
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.480]   we were so in sync today and then you had to go and ruin it.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.480]   - Apple's never gonna put a touchscreen on it.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.960]   They don't wanna, they're already losing market share
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.680]   to the iPad.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.240]   It feels like there's more greenery
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.320]   than there used to be here, am I wrong?
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.880]   - We've lost Leo, where's Leo?
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.680]   - Daily show. - I'm a little bit.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.000]   - Leo the Forest.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.840]   - Do you feel better now Owen?
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.440]   Are you feeling a little more at home in the Grove?
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.000]   - Do you know why I feel better?
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.120]   - Why? - Because I enjoy my heart
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.240]   every time Georgia giggles
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.280]   when they put you on screen.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.800]   Of course I feel better.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.160]   She's my Chewbacca mom for right now
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.760]   and I'm enjoying the heck out of it.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.960]   - I'm just waiting for something more.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960]   - This week in Wiccan.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.280]   (laughing)
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.400]   - I'm just able to find Leo.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.840]   (laughing)
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.200]   - Actually, speaking of the Chewbacca mom,
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.480]   don't you have one of those masks, Clayton?
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.760]   Did you get it? - What?
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.600]   - Did you, ah!
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.440]   Ah!
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.280]   Ah!
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.740]   Oh my God, that's terrifying.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:13.600]   Can you laugh maniacally for us?
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.860]   (laughing)
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:19.520]   - Oh, it hurts.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.640]   (laughing)
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.880]   (laughing)
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.720]   - Hey, Clayton.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.560]   - It's a little too tight.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.400]   - I love it.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.720]   - I love it.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.160]   - Can you wear the mask and go drown around with it?
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.560]   - You can't, by the way, we tried.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.000]   - A D.W.B. experience.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.160]   - We desperately tried to get those.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.400]   (laughing)
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:41.040]   - So you listen to her laugh.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:41.880]   - It's a music.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880]   - I'm just drinking.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.800]   - She's like the Chewbacca mom.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.640]   - People listening, they have home right now.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.640]   - Like right in their car.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   - Like right in my laptop at the same time.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:50.840]   - The
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.760]   - The hair is removed to shirt.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.440]   - Well, I don't think that really explains the whole,
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.280]   the
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.120]   - Leo has removed the shirt.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.360]   - The totality of the experience, frankly.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.160]   - He looks like a,
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.000]   he looks like a,
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.840]   (clapping)
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.440]   the hair shampoo.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.600]   What is it, what the,
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.520]   (laughing)
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.520]   it begins with the N.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.360]   - Yes.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.680]   - Naturally,
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.520]   - This looks like weird.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.680]   - Nature's,
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.520]   - We're taking a photo.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.360]   - Yeah.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.200]   - We're trying to remember this moment.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.040]   - What is that?
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.680]   What is that hair shampoo?
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.120]   Where the girl puts it on and she turns it
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.520]   into a jungle and she's having like the time of her life.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.360]   - Oh yeah.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.200]   What is that?
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.040]   I know what you're talking about.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040]   - That's new.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.440]   - Nature's,
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.280]   - Oh my God.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.120]   - Herbal essence.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.480]   - Herbal essence, herbal essence.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.480]   - Leo Leport looks like he is an herbal essence commercial
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.560]   and he is waiting for the shower scene to start.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.960]   He is surrounded by flowers and trees and foliage
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.240]   and a microphone.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.080]   - I agree.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.040]   - He's a silver fox in the wood.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:43.880]   - Dude, right there.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.440]   - He is a silver fox.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.800]   - What do you want to talk about?
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.320]   - I want to know what people that just tune in
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.480]   at this point.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.360]   (laughing)
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.200]   They're gonna be like,
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.640]   - I feel that I have now,
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.240]   I'm channeling Johnny Ive
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.440]   and I really want to have kind of a twit-glade,
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.080]   a twit-forest.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.680]   And by the way, you're laughing
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.280]   but the entire studio audience is also disrobed.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.280]   (laughing)
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.600]   - Now who's running a foliage course?
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.440]   - Oh.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.000]   - Every Sunday they got naked with you
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.080]   and you got plants all around.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.880]   Welcome to the new twit cult.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.200]   - It's the new twit cult.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.680]   - It's the new twit cult.
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.680]   - 2.0.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.680]   - So we're gonna take a break.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.000]   - Is this a snapchat?
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.400]   (laughing)
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.760]   - I'm living in Snapchat.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.080]   - I feel I'm living.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.320]   - No, I feel like I'm not.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.640]   - I'm trying to,
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.280]   I just need Clayton to wear a mask
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.400]   and ride around the hood with me
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.960]   and see if we get a DWB show going on.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.040]   Two brothers in the hood.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.320]   - Two brothers in the hood.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.160]   - And by the way,
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.960]   that is both better and worse with video.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.080]   So if you're listening,
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:54.280]   then this might be when you wanna download and watch.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.960]   Or maybe not actually come to think of it.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.040]   Let's talk about Mars.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.480]   Elon Musk has taken us there.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.640]   I wasn't here for this episode,
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.760]   but Becky Worley, Christina Warren,
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.280]   Owen J.J. Stone and Jason Heiner were.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.800]   - Elon Musk, he has a plan for our future.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.880]   Colonizing Mars. - Of course.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.200]   - At the International Astronautical,
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.360]   yes, at the International Astronautical Conference
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.200]   in Guadalajara, Mexico.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.160]   He gave a talk, it was called
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.800]   Making Humans a Multi-planetary Species.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:28.840]   And this is his idea for getting to Mars.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.600]   SpaceX.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.800]   I'm gonna break down the specifics.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.320]   'Cause that's basically what Elon did.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.680]   It was incredible.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.720]   And whenever he does this,
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.800]   when he gets into the nitty gritty
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.720]   of talking about his absolutely insane plans,
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.080]   it sort of boggles my mind at how bored he sounds,
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.000]   talking about these amazing ideas
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.920]   and seemingly impossible to execute concepts.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.120]   So I will try not to go at it with the same sense of like,
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.040]   oh yes, when we go to Mars, board 'em.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.600]   But let me just try and break this down for you.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   So SpaceX would use reusable BFRs.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.360]   These are big bleep rockets,
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.360]   along with the BFS, big bleep spaceship,
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:19.240]   wrapped a rocket capable of 680,000 pounds of thrust.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.760]   The ship would carry 100 tons of cargo.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.040]   Once in orbit, it would be refueled.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.540]   Then it takes off for Mars.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.520]   He really got down to the nitty gritty
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.340]   in terms of cost.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.600]   So right now he says it would cost
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.320]   about $10 billion per person to send someone to Mars.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.080]   His goal is to scale this down,
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.920]   just make it the economies of scale work
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.600]   for him targeting $200,000 per person.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.680]   Eventually $100,000.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.840]   He's all about reusable parts.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.240]   Trips take 100 people at a time.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.440]   The spaceship would have movie rooms,
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.360]   cafeterias, entertainment options.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.320]   He says it would be a really fun place.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.000]   That's his quote, a fun place.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.800]   Yeah, I don't know how long you'd have to be on that ship.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.760]   That's sort of terrifying.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:12.720]   He's targeting 2022 for these flights.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.480]   Public and private organizations
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.000]   are gonna help fund the missions
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   and a million humans could live on Mars by the 2060s.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.640]   Are you guys in?
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.480]   You going?
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.680]   Can I break in on this report real quick
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.640]   just for two seconds?
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   Whoa, you've been hijacked.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.720]   This is my buddy Tony.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.600]   Say hi to people, Tony.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.600]   Hi, how's it going?
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.000]   Tony, what's your college degree?
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.280]   I have a bachelor's degree in marine science
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.880]   with a concentration in marine biology.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.680]   What's your current job right now?
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.520]   Jet mechanic.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.840]   For who?
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.680]   The United States Air Force.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.200]   So basically Tony's really smart guy
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.320]   just trying to do as quick as possible.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.760]   So reference Tony, are we going to Mars?
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.760]   How long will it take us to get to Mars?
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.880]   Tony's face expresses skepticism for those of you listening.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.720]   How long, how long, Tony?
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.320]   Just give me an estimated time period, like a year.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.160]   I don't know.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.000]   I'm not a long time.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.360]   50,000, 20,000.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.080]   Oh boy, like a long time.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.000]   Like a hundred thousand.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:00.920]   More than 10 years.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.760]   More than 10?
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.080]   Yeah. Okay.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:03.920]   That's all I need.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.760]   Good.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.840]   So the big brain sitting next to you,
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.480]   oh, doctor says this is total malarkey.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.600]   We're not going to Mars.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.320]   First of all, I'll let you guys talk,
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.640]   but let me just say this.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.160]   I want, I love Elon Musk.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.040]   I love the sun.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:18.920]   I love the solar.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.040]   I love Hyperloop.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.880]   I love most of the things he talks about.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.000]   But for peace's sake,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.800]   could you just use that big brain?
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.040]   And all this money you want to put into a desert rock planet
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.320]   that doesn't sustain life.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.080]   And fix the planet we got right now.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.360]   Can we figure out a way to stop killing all these bees
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.200]   in the ocean?
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.200]   So we got out of planet we got right here
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.280]   for such sustainability.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.960]   Can we get 10 billion dollars to just clean up the homeless
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.400]   and give them a job or something?
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.600]   Instead of per person to put them on a planet
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.640]   that can't sustain life.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.920]   Can we do that, Elon?
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:46.920]   I love you so much.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.520]   I hate the way you manipulate the stock market in my heart.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.040]   But shut up about Mars.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.080]   And you little ship that crashes at the top,
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.760]   then they're going to be able to land on a--
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.600]   just stop it.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.960]   We ain't going to Mars.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.280]   We ain't going to Mars.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.760]   We ain't going to Mars.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.360]   Now go ahead and talk about it.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.560]   That's it for Twit.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.920]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.360]   How do you start the eyes?
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.600]   I just-- I loved-- and I loved the man so much.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.240]   Like, he-- like, just give me the sun, Elon.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.200]   Fix this Earth we got because you--
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.360]   and bro people can't get the Mars.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.000]   You know, so you want to send these rich--
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.280]   OK, Jason Calicana is going to be the first person Mars.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.160]   He ain't no engineer.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:24.920]   He ain't no mechanic.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.880]   He can't fix nothing.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.480]   What's he going to do?
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.760]   Complain about the weather?
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.520]   Like, we need-- we need gunkers to get to--
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.880]   it's not going to happen, bro.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.000]   That's the perfect segue to the--
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.240]   something I learned last week.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.760]   So the same day that Elon announced this,
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.880]   when I was at this event, Idea Festival last week,
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.280]   which is an innovation event, but it's like 10--
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.280]   you know, 10 costs to you like $10,000, $10,000, right?
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.760]   This event costs you like $100, $200.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.000]   But it's the same kind of people, right?
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.240]   Talking about big ideas.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.560]   So the day that Elon was talking to his big ideas about Mars,
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.160]   there was somebody there, one of the candidates for Mars 1.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.600]   So there's this nonprofit organization called Mars 1.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.960]   They do a lot of work with--
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.640]   it's an international-based organization.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.040]   They do a lot of work with NASA.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.080]   But there's a Mars 1 candidate.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.800]   They've got this down to 100 candidates.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.200]   It's this MIT systems analyst named Yari Golden Castiano.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.760]   And so she was at Idea Festival talking about the fact.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.960]   And I had no idea about this.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.400]   I hadn't heard of this, but it was ironically early.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.440]   It was that morning.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.200]   And then Elon made his presentation that afternoon.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.480]   So I knew a lot more about Mars by the time he did it.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:48.080]   So Mars 1 is this group that they're basically
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.880]   sending scientists, people who can go and study it.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.400]   Because what they found is that we've
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.600]   sent these all of the-- it's not space tourism.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.720]   It's-- they're trying to get some scientists to go up there
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.280]   and do the same thing.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.040]   And ultimately, Elon's worried about which
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.440]   is if we trash this planet, what are we going to do?
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.440]   And so we've sort of reached the limits, what Mars 1 posits,
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.600]   is that we've reached the limits of what we can do with robots.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.360]   We actually have to send some people there.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.800]   But sending them and they get them back is the hard thing.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.280]   So they want to take a group of 24 people, interdisciplinary,
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.360]   send them to Mars, create this colony with these 24 people,
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.640]   these scientists.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.200]   And so because of that, they're working on--
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.240]   so one of the things that Yari is working on
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.920]   that she talked about-- we have a video of this on Tech
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.080]   Republic.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.320]   We got an interview with her afterward.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.560]   She's working on this laser-based communication.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.240]   So that-- because right now, it takes anywhere
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.440]   from several minutes to almost an hour
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.480]   to get a communication from Mars to Earth.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.280]   And so this laser-based satellite communication,
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.720]   basically super high-speed networking,
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.280]   will send it a lot faster.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.560]   But the idea is the stuff.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:11.080]   And she's working on this at MIT with the idea of hoping
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.520]   that she's going to be one of the candidates on this.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.240]   But if not, at least she can develop technology that's
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.040]   going to help.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.960]   And oh, by the way, this technology, to get it--
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.080]   your point, Odaakde, is that this technology can actually
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.960]   help us here on Earth, too.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.240]   And so a lot of the space technology,
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.640]   a lot of the stuff that went into the space program ended up--
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.840]   yeah, it was OK, and it did interesting things
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.000]   for the space program.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.800]   But the record of the advances that they gave to the tech
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.720]   industry is huge.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.440]   And so that's the bigger benefit to a lot of this stuff.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:52.520]   I think for Elon's case, he's the showman.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.560]   And so his is the PT Barnum version of the Mars story.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.200]   But there are other people who are working on this as well.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.440]   And it's important not to forget that.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.920]   Their goal is they want to send someone two Mars by 2027.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.200]   And they are working toward that.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.360]   They just narrow down their 100 candidates.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:15.080]   Next year, in 2017, they're going to name the 24 candidates.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.800]   And then they're working on working toward this
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.360]   for over the next decade.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.360]   Christine, are you buying it?
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.200]   No, I think eventually.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:27.120]   Yeah, I think eventually I think that because there
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.320]   is real science happening and there's real potential
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.680]   for space for exploration, I think,
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.640]   will we get there sure?
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.120]   I think not to discount Elon because I
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.360]   think that what he's doing is important just insofar
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.360]   that it gets people paying attention.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.400]   It's exciting.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.240]   But to Jason's point, he's very much a PT Barnum sort of guy.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.680]   And I think making these proclamations 2022--
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.760]   that's so close.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.600]   Come on now.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.880]   Let's be real.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.840]   I also really appreciate, I guess,
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.040]   it's sort of funny to me, the way that he kind of phrases this.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.760]   He's like, well, you could die on this mission.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.400]   So please pay me $500,000 to go on the mission
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.200]   where you might die.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.520]   And oh, I'm not willing to go yet until I know
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.720]   that someone can take over my company.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.160]   Because this is basically kind of a suicide mission.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.680]   And so part of me is kind of--
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.600]   I'm intrigued by, I think, what space exploration could do.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.480]   But a little bit, I guess, bothered by--
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.720]   even though I know that fundamentally, what
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.080]   some of the things that Elon Musk wants to do
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:28.320]   have broader technology and scientific, I guess,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.640]   pursuits at their core.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.400]   So much of it does seem to just be about space tourism, which,
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.600]   to me, it's kind of bothersome.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.440]   Because the last thing that-- at least that I want,
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.120]   in the way it's already kind of seeming
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.480]   like how it's being sold now is this is kind of being sold
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.960]   like the modern era of climbing Mount Everest,
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.760]   where it's just rich people who pay $100,000
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.880]   and go and climb the mountain because they can.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.440]   And this is going to be a thing where
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:56.960]   people who are rich enough to go to Mars will go versus people
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.000]   who are actually looking at discovering
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.800]   other systems and what's habitable and what's not,
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.240]   and discovering technologies that might have pursuits
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.040]   other places.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.120]   I don't know.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.640]   The whole thing is kind of like--
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.520]   his whole description of Mars, all I can think about
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.720]   is the movie "Wally" and be like, yeah, you OK.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.920]   So we're just all going to be on this other planet sitting
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.080]   in Stasis, not moving around, just eating and watching TV.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.720]   That's going to be a life.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.920]   The best place on Mars is--
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.920]   the best place on Mars is worse than the worst place on Earth.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:42.200]   And yeah, Elon, not only is the trip there on this massive ship
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.360]   going to be fun because there'll be movie theaters--
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.360]   Sure.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.080]   Because they have movie theaters on my plane to New York
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.360]   that I take every couple weeks.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.880]   That's not so much fun.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.280]   But anyways, he also said it would be a lot of fun on Mars
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.760]   because the gravity's low.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.120]   But one thing that struck me--
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.120]   I kind of feel like a dummy that I didn't--
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.040]   I'm sure everyone else has thought of this before,
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.680]   but it really struck me in his talk
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.640]   how when we think about all of the space exploration
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.600]   and all of the technology innovations that
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.600]   came out of that when we did this through NASA
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.320]   and the moon shot and how those spawned so many businesses
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.480]   and so much entrepreneurship and innovation
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.400]   as those engineers spun out of the government programs
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.840]   and started their own companies.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.480]   But that now it's privatized from the start here with Elon.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.400]   Right.
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.120]   And so you've got-- he was talking about on the ship
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.520]   once it's launched and it's en route to Mars
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.080]   that the solar arrays will deploy.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:40.680]   And I thought, of course, solar, Elon, Solar City, then, of course,
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.920]   that'll be putting itself-- it'll be storing energy
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.200]   into batteries, which will be a part of everything
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.520]   he's doing with Tesla.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:51.120]   Then there's just all the engines
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.080]   that he's going to be innovating,
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.720]   that he's doing, obviously, now with SpaceX.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.960]   But there's got to be a crossover with Hyperloop
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.160]   or with Tesla and realizing that all of this innovation
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:06.480]   and privatization of innovation is going to be in one--
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.560]   it's a publicly traded company, but in one company's--
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.040]   Right.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.720]   --is the most hospices and they will own all of that.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.160]   And that kind of was just on.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.440]   I mean, wow, all these pieces fit together.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.600]   His brain is really big.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:18.960]   Oh, it's--
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.480]   Yeah, no--
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.480]   Go ahead.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.200]   I was just going to say, no, you're right.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.480]   I was going to say his brain is huge.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.360]   But that is sort of problematic, though, isn't it?
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.440]   Because I mean, you're pointing on,
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.920]   like, he's obviously seeing all these puzzles
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.280]   and how it works for him.
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.640]   But I mean, but something like, I think,
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:33.160]   that travel to another planet should
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.000]   be about bigger than just one public company, one private
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:36.800]   enterprise.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.320]   He is nice enough to say, yo, I know you guys are trying
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.480]   to make cars or electric.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480]   You don't want to do it.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.200]   Here's the patent.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.040]   I'm just letting it go.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.840]   I'm not going to fight you guys accordingly anymore.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.680]   He seems like a decent of guy when he's not
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.960]   being an insane sociopath.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.480]   I'm just saying, you told me that we could run the whole world
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.760]   on solar, and we know that.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:54.480]   But guess what?
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.480]   Human beings can't get together to go take some land out
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.440]   in North Dakota, build a solar farm,
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.000]   and get everybody free electricity.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:01.840]   We can't do that.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:02.320]   And guess what?
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.720]   Hyperloop, I haven't seen it.
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:04.920]   We got a test trap that's probably
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.400]   scrambling eggs and small chickens,
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.880]   brains, somewhere out in the desert.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.880]   So I tell you, give me free power.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.120]   Well, I really saw companies in chaos.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.400]   The Hyperloop stuff, the drama there is fantastic.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:18.400]   Because again, we're just going to Mars and eating cookies
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.640]   and dough on the ice cream and watching the ship.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.600]   You can't get Hyperloop together.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.520]   We ain't even got our solar farms yet.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.560]   Would you just pump the brakes, bro?
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.760]   Are we living in domes?
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.000]   We're not going to Mars.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.120]   We're not going to Mars.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:30.840]   We're not going to Mars.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.760]   We're making the Model 3 in mass production first.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.280]   Right.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:33.800]   Right.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   All the same.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.560]   He just sounds like a little kid that's got Plato
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.640]   and is telling me how he's going to make a store.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.400]   And he's going to have millions of dollars cutting.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.880]   I'm like, but, dog, it's Plato.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.400]   Trust me, I'm going to make this store out of Plato.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.680]   And we're going to be rich, dad.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:52.200]   And I'm just like, OK, kid, go in your room and imagine it.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.240]   Yes, I always thought of space as it makes me--
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.120]   I think I'm space phobic, because it makes me
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.040]   feel like there's this dystopian future that's
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.880]   in right around the corner that's going
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.920]   to come crashing down on my children.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.680]   So this dystopian space phobic didn't want to even pay attention.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.200]   Somehow, Elon talking about it and making it
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.600]   sound so boring and so doable.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.840]   Even in his delusional mind, I will totally give you that,
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.320]   oh, doctor.
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.200]   But logical, delusional.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.920]   Maybe that's too contradictory to be real.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.200]   But Jason, what do you think?
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.840]   Is there a logical insanity here?
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.600]   I mean, I think the thing about Elon is--
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:36.080]   Elon is in the truest sense of the word,
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.320]   and it gets overused.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.080]   He's a true visionary.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.920]   The guy dreams in--
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.080]   he sits around daydreaming, and wishes he didn't have to eat.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.640]   He's talked about the fact that how much he liked the idea
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.000]   of something like soiling.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.720]   Because then he could take all this--
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:55.920]   like, whatever, 43 minutes a day that it takes to eat meals
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:58.760]   and get rid of that and put it in a more productive time,
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.160]   like dreaming about Mars, right?
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.800]   And solar power and all these kinds of things.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:08.040]   And so I think that Elon sets these super aggressive goals.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.120]   His companies never get there.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:14.160]   But on the way to trying to get there,
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:19.200]   they get to things faster than other companies, right?
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.800]   Tesla's way far ahead in battery technology,
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:25.040]   and a way far ahead in electric vehicles.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:28.760]   They're way far ahead in a lot of these things.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:33.920]   Because he sets these crazy, stupid, aggressive goals
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:37.800]   that we're going to accomplish this massively hard thing
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.800]   by this time.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.480]   And that's what leaders do, right?
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:44.760]   Leaders push, leaders reach, leaders get you
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:47.960]   to get more out of you than you thought was possible.
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.120]   And so I agree with everybody on the panel.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.360]   Like 2022--
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.440]   yeah, it's not happening.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.760]   It is not happening.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.960]   In 2027, this other Mars, one group, maybe.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.120]   Maybe Elon falls somewhere in there.
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.640]   Like I said, it sounds very peachy,
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.840]   barn them to me.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.680]   It sounds maybe 20 years off.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.800]   But I think that--
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.560]   I can't remember somebody said the fact
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.520]   about how passionate he was talking about this,
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.280]   even compared to some of the other things you Becky,
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.240]   even compared to some of the other stuff he does,
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.840]   where he is reasonably passionate.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.800]   I think this is the thing that gets him up in the morning.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.080]   I think this whole morning's thing.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.320]   And I'll give you an oh, and the fact
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.320]   that there's some bigger problems I
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.560]   wish you would spend this time focusing on,
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.520]   because the guys have some serious brains out.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.840]   If you want to dream big, look me in my face
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.200]   and tell me, you know what?
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.680]   We have problems with the coral reefs.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.520]   If you don't know anything about the coral reefs,
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.000]   it packs the fishing community.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.640]   The fish community impacts the people on land.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.600]   And the food industry, because chickens and all that,
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.320]   they eat fish meal.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.920]   But you don't understand how much fish is in.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.560]   And we get, hey, Elon Musk, come out
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.520]   and tell me you're going to solve that problem in 10 years.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.360]   And I'm strip butt naked and run through these streets,
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.560]   nothing anybody wants to see it.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.920]   But I'd be so happy and proud, just like you told me,
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.320]   that we could take this whole patch of land
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.120]   and power the world.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.720]   Like, I understand about vision.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.720]   I got a lot of vision.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.480]   I got a vision of a machine like a sit-in
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.040]   and just lose weight and not do anything.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.480]   It just melts off the fact.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.160]   I can envision it.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.080]   It ain't going to happen.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.600]   It sounds like it's a cool thing.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.840]   By 2027, I can be 150 pounds.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.160]   It's just saying that he just thinks the fun stuff,
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.000]   doesn't make it a vision.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.360]   He sounds like a little kid sometimes.
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.720]   He gets all hyped up on his stuff.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.000]   And he moves mountains with his words.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.200]   If he told you he liked cookie dough,
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.640]   the stock market would triple
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.400]   within the next half hour after a tweet.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.840]   The man's got too much power.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.640]   Fix the planet first before you start going to a red desert
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:36.480]   with nothing on it.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.640]   I'm not going to yell about it anymore.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.120]   It just makes me really upset.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.680]   - Even what I never talked about is--
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.120]   - He gets connected though.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120]   - He talks about it.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.400]   - It's all interconnected.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.000]   And what's interesting about that, O'Dokta,
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   is that he never talks about political will
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.720]   or the moral will to do some of these things.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:57.600]   He's only dealing with what he has under his control.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.720]   And what's incredible is how much control he actually has.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.320]   - He's growing and it's only going to keep growing too, yeah.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.720]   - He's growing his kingdom with an iron fist, that's for sure.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.880]   - We have had so many great people on this show.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.200]   And I want to thank Becky Worley for filling in for me
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.640]   when I was on vacation.
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:18.520]   One of the nice things about the friends and family
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.520]   that Twitt has gathered around it is that
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.000]   when I take vacation, I know we're going to have
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.200]   a great feeling and Becky is one of our absolute favorites.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.680]   She'll be back, I promise you.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.680]   Our show today, we're going to have some fun with,
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:32.920]   I don't want to give it all away,
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.240]   but some more stuff coming up in just a second.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.200]   But first, a word from our sponsor.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:41.640]   On New Year's Day, you're probably not planning
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.800]   on doing much cooking, you might be planning on relaxing.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.720]   But when it's time to get back in the kitchen,
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.160]   you'll be very glad to see that blue apron box
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.600]   sitting there waiting for you.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.760]   Problem with cooking, I love to cook.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.760]   And I like to make healthy, nutritious,
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.000]   delicious meals for my family.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   But at the end of a long work day,
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.520]   the last thing you probably want to do is let plan a meal,
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:09.600]   go shopping, buy the ingredients, go home,
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.200]   cook them and serve it.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.160]   Blue Aper takes half of that work out
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.320]   and makes the rest of it lots of fun.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.800]   See, what you do is you go to blue apron.com,
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.240]   you look at their menu plan for the week,
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.600]   you pick some meals, then they come to you
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.720]   in a refrigerated box fresh, never frozen,
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.120]   even the meat and fish, with a recipe card,
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.080]   exactly the ingredients you need to make that recipe,
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.520]   no more, no less.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.400]   They have plans for couples.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.920]   In fact, if you're single, it's great too,
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.880]   'cause you make it at dinner
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.080]   and you got to lunch the next day.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.840]   They also have a plan for families
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.880]   and those have more kid-friendly ingredients.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.520]   But in every case, it's something delicious,
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.040]   something you will be amazed you made,
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.720]   you'll be so proud serving it.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.080]   Your kids, your lovers, your friends will go,
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.320]   "Wow, you can really cook."
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.520]   And you'll just go, "Yeah, you don't have to say it's blue apron."
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.320]   You're just, "Yeah, I'm pretty good, I'm getting better."
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.120]   Blue Aper, and look at the menu,
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.320]   steak and green peppercorn sauce with kale
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.280]   and roasted potato.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:05.480]   I hate doing these in my mouth, starts watering.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.800]   Codd and papa yolk with freica,
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.880]   I don't know what that is in spinach,
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.440]   that's another thing, I like about blue apron.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.600]   I learn new ingredients all the time.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.600]   And then I go in the store and say,
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:14.880]   "Yeah, I need some of that freaked it."
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.800]   That was good last time, I don't know what it is even now.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.080]   I haven't used it yet, I will use it this week.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.200]   Potato and artichoke quiche with romaine and orange,
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.200]   South Blue Aper and my friends.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.600]   I'm gonna trust me, you're gonna love it,
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.160]   but I'm gonna get you first three meals free
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.720]   that way you can really appreciate it.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.440]   Go to blueapron.com/twit, first three meals free,
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.720]   free shipping, and I'm sorry,
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:39.080]   they don't deliver to Hawaii or Alaska,
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.800]   it's 99% of the continental United States
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.360]   and that's because they want to come fresh, right?
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.600]   So, but just check it out,
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.520]   I'm sure it's available in your area.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.720]   The best ingredients, fresh, delicious from 150 local farms,
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:54.080]   fisheries and ranchers across the United States.
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:58.600]   And by the way, it costs less than if you did it yourself.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.840]   Less work and less money.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.720]   A grocery store would be about 60% more for the same food.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.960]   And the reason is blueapron doesn't have a store,
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.520]   doesn't have a warehouse, doesn't have brick and mortar,
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.640]   they don't have to worry about waste, they're spoilage.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.080]   So they really can save you money.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.360]   And what a meal.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.080]   I think it was cooking up some love for my family.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.800]   You will too, blueapron.com/twit,
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.240]   blueapron is a better way to cook.
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.000]   And we thank them so much for their support all year long
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   of this weekend tech.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.880]   Oh, it just kept getting worse this year for y'all.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.360]   Worse and worse and worse.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.840]   Stephen Levy, Georgia Dow and Steve Kovac joined me
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.840]   just a couple of weeks ago to talk about
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.520]   the latest bit of bad news for Marissa Meyer and company watch.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:49.480]   It's just one thing after another with Yahoo, isn't it?
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:55.040]   Now they say that one, and I think it's a story
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.040]   just 'cause of the number, one billion user accounts
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:29:59.880]   have been breached.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.340]   This happened a few years ago.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.720]   Remember that of course earlier Yahoo had revealed
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.160]   that half a billion accounts have been breached
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:12.740]   in a separate hack.
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:17.520]   At this point, you gotta wonder is Verizon gonna go through
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.360]   with the deal?
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.240]   What happens to Yahoo next?
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.000]   - We had AOL CEO Tim Armstrong,
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.360]   who's kind of helping spearhead that deal
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.680]   at our conference week and a half ago now.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:32.680]   And this was before the disclosure of the hack.
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.480]   And we asked my colleague, Aston Point Blank,
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:38.080]   like put a number on this,
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.960]   what's the percentage chance that this happens?
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.320]   He wouldn't do that, but he's like,
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.800]   I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal's gonna go through
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.120]   week later, this happens.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.360]   - Oh, hey.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.120]   - So it's either gonna be a discount,
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.760]   you gotta think they still want to go off.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.160]   - Well they asked for a billion off.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.760]   They already, Verizon asked for a billion off
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.560]   for the first hack.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:59.200]   And actually, what's really important is,
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.200]   what did Marissa Meyer know and when did she know it?
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.240]   What did she hide this material information
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.240]   from Verizon and other suitors
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.920]   when they were selling the company?
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:15.240]   And there's some evidence that she did on the 2014 hack.
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:19.660]   This billion account hack happened a year earlier.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:24.080]   So it would stretch credulity to think that Marissa Meyer
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:29.000]   did not know about this billion account hack from 2013.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.480]   - I'm just shocked that that many people still use Yahoo.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.760]   - I know, that was the other thing.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.200]   A billion people really.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.560]   Names and addresses, telephone numbers,
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.680]   dates of birth, passwords.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.720]   The company says it thinks it's distinct from the 2014 hack
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.560]   and it says, oh, the hackers aren't in our network anymore.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:51.120]   So they say, I don't know.
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.680]   - Yeah.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:53.520]   - What do you think?
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.320]   If Verizon pulls out, maybe they'll just ask
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.480]   for another billion off.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.200]   - What happens?
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.800]   - Yeah, there's still a lot of value in Yahoo, right?
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.200]   Because of Alibaba, Japan and all that kind of stuff.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.040]   I mean, there's--
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.840]   - Well, you don't get the Alibaba steak with the--
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.360]   - Okay, Alibaba, yeah, that's true.
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.960]   But there is a lot of value still tied up in there
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.480]   and they do have a massive user base.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.600]   So I mean, it's, and especially for what AOL
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.160]   wants to do with it and makes sense.
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.400]   - We do know they have a massive user base, but--
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.160]   (laughing)
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:26.320]   - No, but people got here.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.160]   - Got here.
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.600]   - That's all a lot of people get their news.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.560]   You wanna talk about visiting a homepage
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.360]   for getting your news, Yahoo is massive.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.800]   - I use my Yahoo for years as my homepage.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.680]   I'm happy to say I've grown out of it,
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:42.520]   but it was my homepage.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:45.400]   - This is the big news of the weekend at least.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.000]   You can pull out my screen here, brace yourselves.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000]   I have these kids in the room.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.080]   - You don't wanna get them out.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.520]   But here is Robert Scobel wearing the news.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.360]   - There you go.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.560]   - At the spectacles.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.400]   - Don't you know about Snapchat?
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.240]   You can turn taken off the screen.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.200]   - There's multiples of this photo.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.040]   - Thank you.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.480]   - I love the fact that the producers here
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.080]   are just so quick to get something off the screen.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.680]   That's just absolutely abhorrent.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.520]   Okay.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.440]   (laughing)
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.360]   Here we go.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.920]   I think we just had to put the explicit on the iTunes
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:11.920]   for a minute show.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.280]   - Nice.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.800]   - So let's watch the video here,
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.040]   and I think we can talk over it.
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:21.040]   But as people know, I don't know, four or five years ago,
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.640]   Snapchat rather bought a promising company
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.440]   that was making video sunglasses.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:32.440]   And it was an indiegogo and a Kickstarter.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.840]   It was one of these like ClueG hardware projects
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.560]   that you figured, "Ah, they're never gonna deliver it."
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:40.200]   I believe they did deliver their product.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.920]   - Never shipped it.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.760]   - They never shipped it?
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:47.240]   'Cause I went to one of the pages and they said they got it.
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.080]   - My pictures of it.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:48.920]   - Nice snap.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:49.760]   - Anyways.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.600]   - Pictures of the founder here.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:51.440]   - Yeah.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.280]   - Anyways.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.080]   - These were the pictures of the prototypes.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:53.920]   I don't know.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.160]   - Is there a camera here that came out?
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.520]   - There's a camera looking at you.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.600]   - Yeah.
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.200]   - Look at direction in your face.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.720]   - Yeah, so there's a founder wearing them.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.440]   And the way these work--
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.440]   - This is two years ago, but--
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:04.680]   - This is two years ago.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.080]   The way these product works is,
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.040]   if you press a button on the corner,
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.800]   it lights up an LED circle for 10 seconds,
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.640]   records whatever you see,
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.360]   and post it automatically to your Snapchat.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.560]   You never have to take your phone out of your pocket,
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.720]   you never have to authenticate or whatever it is.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:27.520]   And critically, and I think that this is the big difference,
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.200]   Google Glass resulted in many people
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.360]   getting punched in the face,
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.840]   beat up, or many arguments and fights started because--
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.680]   - Nah, that was--
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680]   - No, they were funny.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.600]   - Okay, whatever.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.440]   There's three or four that were well documented.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.240]   One by a woman who I think was trying--
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.080]   - Sarah Slocum.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.040]   - The sense I got was she was trying
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.160]   to provoke people with them.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.520]   She was.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.880]   I mean, let's be honest, she was provoking people.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:48.800]   - That's who we are, right?
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.680]   - No, that's a dream.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.520]   - No, we're--
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.360]   - She was just--
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.200]   - This is--
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.040]   - People in a bar.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:54.880]   - We're just wrong.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.120]   - We're wearing weird things on our face
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.920]   and lying to the first society.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.760]   - Go ahead.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.120]   - She was trying to pick fights.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.280]   I remember that.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.480]   She was picking fights with me,
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:04.000]   she was picking fights with you.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.560]   - No, she would walk up to you and be like,
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.400]   I'm recording you right now.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.240]   What did I do?
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.920]   You feel like you felt like you were being insulted
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.040]   by paparazzi and then she would do it in a bar
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.200]   in San Francisco, which by the way,
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.120]   I don't think you wanna go into a bar in San Francisco
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.320]   or anywhere and then, especially at a dive bar,
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.000]   then go up to somebody who's after drunk
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   and say, can I record you?
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.760]   We're not even asked to start recording them.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.560]   But spectacles, they're totally different.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.680]   At least in my opinion.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:26.720]   They're like, the price is completely different.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.560]   - 130.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.640]   - Which is just a--
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.720]   - Versus 1300.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.400]   - Which is a totally reasonable price for normal sunglasses.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.000]   - Times have changed.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:34.840]   - That too.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.920]   - We have Snapchat now.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.600]   And Snapchat is a daily video show about your life.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.440]   It's split up into little segments.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.000]   We might call them in TV land shots, right?
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.880]   We're right now, somebody is choosing
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.640]   who to focus the cameras on.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:49.480]   - Yes.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:50.320]   - That's a shot.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.160]   - Probably.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.000]   - Snapchat.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.960]   - We're on air for five seconds or 10 seconds, right?
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.320]   While we're talking.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.400]   And in Snapchat, that's what you're doing.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.640]   You're capturing videos in a small segment.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:00.480]   - Yeah.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.600]   - And it builds a narrative about your day.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.400]   And you can actually grab the day
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.800]   and store it to your phone or share it
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.920]   out on other places like Facebook or YouTube, right?
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:14.120]   - So they solve the problem
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.720]   of you wanna punch the person in the face
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.240]   because they're recording you covertly
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.400]   because you're gonna press them.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.400]   However, it is inevitable, Brian,
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.920]   that these will result in people putting up
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.720]   no snap glasses in this bar, in this club,
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:30.600]   at this concert, correct?
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.600]   - So it is, I mean, you look at--
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:32.440]   - Will there be a backlash?
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:33.280]   How big?
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.640]   - There was that woman who posted something
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.600]   on Snapchat from her gym, right?
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.680]   There was the person that was older,
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.000]   a little heavier standing over a tub, I think.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.680]   And she's like, I can't unsee this,
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.520]   then you have to see it too.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.360]   - That's a good philosophy.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.080]   - She meant to send it to a friend
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:48.280]   and she sent it to her followers instead.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.960]   - Taking the pictures illegal.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.440]   - Right, snapping a picture in a locker room.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.160]   - Right, completely illegal, right?
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.560]   - I didn't realize that was actually a law.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.360]   I just thought that was a California law.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.680]   - In California.
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:00.000]   - That's also why the cameras on your phone
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.040]   make a noise.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.000]   They don't have to make a noise,
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.280]   but they make a noise to alert people
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.360]   when you're in the gym club, you know,
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.200]   a shower, right?
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.840]   - Which said I had to light on.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.800]   - Right, so I think they're doing this the right way.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.640]   These are crazy, you can't miss them.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.680]   They're not at Google Glass, it's also used
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.080]   to open web browsers and only you can see
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.840]   and like all this other junk that that was supposed to do.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.680]   - Single function.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.160]   - Single function, I'm here to do this crazy thing
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:25.240]   and you really can't hide them in a shower somewhere, right?
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.160]   - Right, most people don't understand why Google Glass
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.920]   caused these fights.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.280]   It really doesn't have anything to do about the camera
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.440]   'cause I was in the Sahara tent at Coachella
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.240]   and everybody's recording on their phones.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.080]   - Well you know.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.640]   - But there was two guys in front of me,
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.080]   one talked to the other and said,
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.600]   I need to get away from the Google Glass people.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.280]   I wasn't wearing it 'cause I didn't wear it then.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.480]   There was two people behind me who had Google Glass on.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.560]   So I grabbed these two guys and said,
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.040]   what makes you nervous about this?
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.080]   You're in a place where everybody's recording
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.800]   so some other camera. - You're on camera for sure.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.720]   - And they said, it just makes me feel bad.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:01.560]   - Yes.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.320]   - Two reasons I pulled out of them.
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:06.720]   One, there's a screen between them that they can't see
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.040]   and they can't renegotiate the social contract
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.080]   that we have with each other.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.720]   If you start playing with Facebook right now
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:13.080]   in the middle of the show,
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.920]   it's up your hand, why are you doing that?
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.200]   And there's something more important to pay attention to.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.200]   And the second thing is they felt that the person
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:26.280]   who had them on had information about them
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.680]   that they didn't have about the people that had them on.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:31.720]   - So they had an advantage, an information advantage.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.440]   I'll tell you why I don't like it
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.360]   because I saw Google Executive get on the dance floor
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.040]   and all the girls left the dance floor.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.640]   And I thought that was the reason.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:42.200]   I was like, we were just sitting here dancing
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.800]   with like 10 girls and you literally
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.640]   Google Executive.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.280]   - Well, they're not, they were not that fashionable.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.200]   - They were not that fashionable.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.040]   The Spectacles, if you actually look at the fact--
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.240]   - Well, look at these, pull this one up.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.000]   I mean, this is Evan Spiegel who's dating a supermodel.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:55.840]   I don't know who would--
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.000]   - Oh, I think they're married or engaged.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.400]   - They're engaged.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.520]   - I mean, and look, this, I mean, he's from LA.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.680]   He's a hip dude and look at the side.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:03.520]   - No.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.600]   - He's got the side thing here.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.600]   I mean, it looks good.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.040]   - So the style is in right now for like teenagers,
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.280]   like 13 to 18.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.200]   So it's part of it.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.680]   So, you know, I wanna do one prediction with the group.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.000]   Okay, here we go.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.520]   Prediction along bet.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.000]   Prediction along bet.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.200]   - Let's do a bet on sales.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.040]   - Okay, here we go.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:21.640]   - Sales. - So it's time frame.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:24.960]   - Sales, total, let's see.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.680]   2017 sales, not 20, when do they come out?
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:29.520]   - By the end of the year.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:30.360]   - By the end of the year.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.520]   So 2017 was the first full year?
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.600]   - No, start with the begin when they come out
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.440]   till the end of the season.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.280]   - All right, well, no, no, no.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:37.800]   Let's give them all a get on the first X.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.560]   Let's just say 2018.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.680]   2018 total sales.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:44.480]   Everybody write it down or type it on your computer.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.960]   Or actually, no, somebody can set the line.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:46.800]   That's the better way to do it.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.960]   We'll set the line in the make a bet.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.160]   Who wants to set the line?
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.000]   Totally in a sold.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:50.840]   - What does that mean?
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:51.840]   - Set the line is over-unversed.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:52.760]   - We're gonna do over-unversed.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.840]   So if you pick 10 million,
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.640]   I can pick over or under.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:57.760]   So you set the line.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.560]   - Every teenager's gonna have them.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.640]   - Every teenager, okay.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.280]   30 to 20 million Americans.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.040]   70, 80 million of them are under.
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:05.360]   - I think these are $130.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.680]   - They have to.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.880]   Let's say 20% of teenagers are gonna have them
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:09.800]   in the first year.
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:10.640]   - That's 14 million.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.520]   Whatever number you pick with them's already saying under.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.800]   - I'm gonna say 3.5, yeah, okay.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.240]   - You have no clue.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.080]   - All right, here we go.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.080]   It's gonna make a good bet.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:18.920]   - And again.
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:21.560]   - This is so funny 'cause I'm gonna take half my ego.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.880]   I'm gonna park half over here.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.640]   (laughing)
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.400]   - And right now you're telling me.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.400]   - All right, the chat is giving a whole bunch of things.
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.520]   - I've been meeting with groups of teenagers
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.840]   to study this.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.520]   All right, and every single teenager says they want one.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.360]   - Of course.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.040]   - So, and--
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:36.880]   - And it's 105--
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.480]   - When I go to Coachella, when Thomas Hock and I went
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.800]   to Coachella and shot people with big cameras,
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.960]   the millennials came up and danced for us.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.960]   They want their picture taken.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.200]   What is this Snapchat era?
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.720]   It's a selfie era.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.800]   It's a, ah, look at me era.
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.640]   - Okay.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:55.240]   - This is gonna be very, very popular.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.040]   - Okay, so the number, give us a number.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:58.880]   - I'd say--
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.760]   - We're at, by the way, we're gonna bet four--
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:01.600]   We're gonna bet four--
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.160]   - 18 months. - A pair of the glasses.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.920]   Whatever the highest end pair is from Snapchat,
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:05.760]   we'll bet for glasses.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.040]   - In the first 18 months, basically, you're--
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.040]   - No, no, no, no, it's 2018.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.640]   2018-- - Yeah, that's calendar year, 2018.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.000]   - The calendar year, 2018.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.200]   - So wait, so it's just sales in there or total from before?
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:17.360]   - Total sales in 2018 only, not counting the first year.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.280]   'Cause the first year could be like, who knows?
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.400]   - How many GoPros sell a year?
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.240]   - That's a good question.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.040]   It's gonna be-- - That's the over-under end.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.880]   - Will it beat GoPro?
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:26.800]   That's the over-under.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.120]   Because that's the real one.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.680]   - But obviously-- - That's the real company
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:33.120]   that's disrupts because the technology on this is so amazing.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.320]   - If you're saying if it's GoPro,
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.880]   I guarantee it sells more than GoPro.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:37.960]   - Right. - In 2018.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:38.800]   - 100%.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.520]   As a matter of fact, I will bet--
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.600]   - I'll take that too.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.760]   - Okay, I'll say it's double.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.640]   Double GoPro sales in 2018.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.400]   Of traditional GoPro cameras,
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:48.440]   a GoPro comes out with one of these,
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.680]   I can't say that 'cause it--
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.800]   - That's like a GoPro anymore.
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.400]   - For sure, it'll outsell GoPro.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.240]   What do you think, Brian?
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.240]   Where would you set the line
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.080]   and the number that will be sold in 2018?
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.600]   - I give up, he told me I was wrong.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.440]   - What do you think?
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.560]   - Is it gonna be-- - No, you know,
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.040]   so I totally get the kids using them.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.440]   I actually like this angle where,
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.520]   if I was thinking about getting a GoPro,
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.360]   which could cost hundreds of dollars or more, right?
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.920]   - Yeah. - I'm gonna get these instead.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.840]   - But it's only eight or 10 seconds.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:13.200]   It's not the whole three hours of my mountain climb, right?
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.320]   - GoPro sold 1.6 billion in 2015.
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.400]   - Billion? - What?
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.480]   - 1.6 billion dollars. - Billion dollars.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.280]   - Sales, revenue. - Right.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.160]   - 1.6 billion dollars. - Revenue.
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:25.320]   So if you divide that by $400 average,
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.480]   you're talking about whatever,
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.240]   40 million of them or something like that.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.760]   - All right, that's in 2015.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.440]   So, and they're gonna sell probably more than--
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.360]   - I don't know how much they cost.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   A four million of them, actually.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.760]   It'll be four million, four million times 400.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.360]   - Yeah, four million times 400.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:45.000]   I would say 2018 sales, I'll set the line at six million units.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.520]   - Slightly under.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:49.120]   - Under or over and 20 seconds?
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:49.960]   - I think it's way over that.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.040]   - Okay, way over that. - He thinks way over that.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:52.040]   He's got me convinced. - Slightly under?
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:52.880]   What do you say?
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.720]   - I'll take it over. - You take the over?
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:55.280]   - Okay, great. - I'm gonna take the under.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.680]   So we have two unders, two overs.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:58.520]   We'll bet--
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:42:59.560]   - I hope I'm wrong.
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:00.920]   Please send me glasses. - Oh no, even better.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.840]   We'll bet, we'll bet whatever the most expensive hamburger
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.000]   in San Francisco is.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.640]   - And heart, heart away says-- - There's gonna be
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.040]   $120 truffle hamburger, we'll find it.
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:12.680]   - Heart away says kids will be over it in 2018?
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.000]   - No, no. - No.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.760]   - Okay, so here's the feature that's missing from this
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.680]   that I thought I had just written about it last week,
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.400]   'cause I heard this was coming.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:23.760]   The piece that's missing is it's not a DVR.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:27.760]   And what this really should be is it should always be recording.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:28.600]   - Yeah.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.500]   - I know this will get people punched in the face,
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.480]   but I, really where this is going,
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.800]   and I think this will probably happen by 2020,
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.120]   and I would fund a startup to do this,
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.160]   'cause it's inevitable anyway,
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:37.360]   so I'm not gonna make a judgment call on it.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.680]   But if it's a DVR, and at any point in time I can press it,
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:45.040]   and go back on the last hour, find that clip, right?
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.280]   And boom, so I don't have to press it.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.160]   I say, wow, that was a funny moment, now I'm pressing it.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.160]   - Now this is like, my wife says it all the time.
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.560]   If we could just go back five seconds,
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.560]   that thing you said, you say you didn't say.
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.400]   - Yeah. - And like,
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.240]   this is like a divorce product, not happening.
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.240]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.280]   - I didn't say that.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.600]   - You say that. - Yeah, I know, yeah, exactly.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.440]   - I never said that. - I never said that.
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:04.440]   - I never said that. - I never said that.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.680]   - I'm gonna wear it. - You won't let that chat.
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:07.880]   - Take your glasses off. - Nobody's marrying you, Ben.
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:09.960]   - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - I'm not gonna wear it
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.480]   while I'm on a date, but here's the other thing.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.240]   I think you're gonna see a big load on 2017,
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.840]   and it's gonna be less, a little bit less in 2018,
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.880]   because it's a two every other year kind of product.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.800]   - The thing we're all missing,
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.400]   is there's some real technology in this product.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.040]   There's two lenses, there's a reason for that,
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.880]   because with two lenses, you do a--
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.680]   - Sure. - Do a computer on the diff,
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.280]   and you can build a point cloud-- - Dap.
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:36.200]   - Of all you metric point cloud. - Sure.
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:41.120]   - So I can capture you in three dimensions for VR and AR,
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:44.880]   and the algorithms that they're developing for AR,
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.400]   putting things on your face,
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400]   are getting really advanced for 2D,
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.320]   wait until they do it in 3D.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.440]   - It's fairly clear that this is a step,
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.400]   a very pragmatic step towards augmented reality.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.640]   - Correct. - Yeah.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.560]   - I think you all agree on that.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.800]   - Streams are too expensive.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:01.800]   The screens are very expensive,
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.560]   so if people get addicted to this,
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:06.520]   then I believe the second feature that's missing,
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:09.120]   that would be pretty neat after the life DVR,
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:10.600]   I'll call it, the life DVR,
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.000]   is over people's head,
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.320]   putting their last snap,
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:19.080]   if you're friends, who you're friends in common are.
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.880]   In other words, when you walk through the world
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:23.800]   and you go to a party, you don't know who you know.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.480]   And you don't know who you've met before,
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.000]   and you may not remember who their wife,
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.080]   or their husband is, or their kid's names are,
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.680]   or who they dated in your social circle.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.280]   You're gonna actually have all that information
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.960]   floating on top of people's heads,
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.760]   and that would really, really, really benefit.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.600]   - It's a nice feature. - It's a nice feature.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.040]   - They can do a lot more than bokeh.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.040]   People in the chat room are asking,
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:43.480]   "What does this mean that you can do?"
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.080]   If you have depth information,
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.200]   you can turn this entire world into Minecraft, for instance.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.960]   And all of a sudden, Ben is a Minecraft character over there,
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.920]   and the whole world is bricks, right?
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.000]   And that helps me make better content.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.760]   Most people suck at content.
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:01.960]   Most people just know how to do a selfie,
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:04.040]   or a little picture at Yosemite or something.
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:05.120]   - They don't know how to frame the shot,
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.280]   they don't know how to blur the background.
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.400]   - They don't know how to tell a story.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.200]   I read a lot of Snapchat's,
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:10.240]   and look at a lot of Snapchat's,
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.880]   and look at a lot of people's behavior
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:13.760]   on Twitter and Facebook to understand them.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:15.400]   Most people suck at content.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.960]   And this augmented reality stuff
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.160]   that they're doing on the face
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.360]   helps you tell a better story about yourself.
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:21.800]   It makes you more interesting.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.440]   It's funny to look at the feed,
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:26.840]   and see Ben par wearing drag, you know?
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.680]   (laughing)
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:29.520]   - I had the image.
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:30.360]   - Filters you did too.
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.760]   - That's where I was wearing drag.
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:32.920]   - Drag, drag, drag.
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.400]   - Right.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.880]   - By the way, by the way,
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.560]   I ended up getting those Snapchat spectacles,
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.400]   and you know what?
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:41.720]   They're actually pretty cool.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:44.600]   I actually really like them.
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.320]   I've been snapping.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.280]   And the funny thing is I have two kids,
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:50.360]   you know, 24 and 22,
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.080]   and we're in Abby.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.120]   And I told Abby, she's the 24-year-old,
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.480]   "Hey, I just got the Snapchat spectacle."
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.920]   She said, "What are those?"
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:00.760]   I said, "Snapchat."
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.280]   She said, "Oh yeah, I'm too old for that."
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.120]   24.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.720]   And then my son Henry, I thought,
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.280]   well, I know he snaps.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.240]   And I said, "Did you see that?"
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:10.360]   Look at this, look at this.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.800]   Your dad's not such an old man after all.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.360]   So what's that dad?
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.280]   - Spectacles.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.160]   - He had no idea.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:21.760]   The lad, if you're a parent, you know this.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.600]   The last person you'll ever impress is your own kids, never.
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:28.440]   In a bit, we're going to say farewell to our old,
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.080]   studios, but first I want to thank,
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:35.000]   I think one of the biggest blessings
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.800]   moving to our new East Side Studio is our internet here.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.200]   Do you know we have 10 gigabit
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.200]   symmetric internet access in this studio?
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.880]   So fast that I can't even use it on most of my computers
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:53.080]   'cause the best they could do is one gigabit.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.160]   And it's from the best internet service provider
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.000]   in the country.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.880]   And I say that with absolute confidence.
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.200]   SonicNet, I've been a SonicNet customer
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:01.400]   for more than a decade.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.280]   I've known Dane Jasper, the founder,
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.240]   for longer than that even.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:06.800]   I've interviewed him many times.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.400]   He's, I consider him a friend.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.880]   And when we said we're moving,
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:11.920]   Dane said, "Well, you really ought to have the best internet
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:13.680]   "as it just so happens."
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:16.360]   You're in a Sonic neighborhood.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:18.960]   Man, if you're in a Sonic neighborhood, get Sonic.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.640]   Sonic is an EFF5 star rated ISP.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.080]   They protect their users.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.040]   They don't have bandwidth caps.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:29.080]   They fight any attempt by the government
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.680]   or anybody else to get your private information.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:33.120]   They're the good guys.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:36.000]   And you will love the price of what you can get.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.200]   Now I know it's not everywhere.
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.880]   But Sonic, I think this is important
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.120]   because Sonic is showing you can do this,
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.600]   set a standard for internet access
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.520]   so that others around the country can see it
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.600]   and appreciate it and do it.
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.160]   So even if you can't get Sonic,
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.240]   and I'm sorry if you can't,
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.160]   you should be thrilled that they're around.
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:55.720]   Here's what you get.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.920]   I'm embarrassed even to tell you this
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.920]   'cause it's just gonna make you unhappy.
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.880]   Sonic's mission to bring internet freedom to all
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:08.160]   with unlimited, uncapped internet,
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:11.240]   residential or business fiber to the premise,
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:14.720]   not to the curb, but into the premise,
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.200]   gigabit connectivity.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.200]   It's for San Francisco, California,
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.920]   the North Bay area of California,
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.000]   the East Bay area, but they are expanding.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.880]   So go to sonic.com,
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.960]   so nic.com/twit and check,
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.760]   see if it's available.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.920]   'Cause here's what you get.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:33.640]   15, well this is one account,
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:35.720]   15 email accounts,
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.600]   a gigabyte of personal storage,
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.160]   personal web hosting with a new domain.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.080]   You get fax line service,
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.720]   you get a home phone connection.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.000]   This is all at one price.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.920]   There's no add-ons to this.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.840]   Home phone connection with unlimited local
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:53.040]   and long distance calling.
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.480]   And by the way, you can port your number.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.960]   So if you have an existing number,
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.840]   you can bring it right over to sonic.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:04.080]   Download speeds of up to 1000 megabits per second,
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:04.920]   a gigabit.
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.840]   And man, you have not lived until you have a gigabit.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.360]   With no caps.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.520]   No caps.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:16.080]   You ready?
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:16.920]   You wanna know how much?
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.440]   How much would you pay?
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.760]   $40 a month.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.040]   $40 a month.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:26.200]   And with that, for absolutely free,
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.280]   you get there stand up,

[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.240]   uncapped bandwidth.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.440]   I love sonic.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:35.920]   I think you probably figured that out by now.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.080]   And we thank them so much.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.440]   They are providing us with our internet.
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:41.200]   This is how we get to you through
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:44.840]   sonic's 10 gigabit fiber connection to the outside world.

[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:03.160]   The great team at sonic.
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:07.080]   If you enjoy Twit,
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:08.680]   you could thank sonic.
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.840]   And even if you don't enjoy Twit,
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:13.800]   thanks sonic for making it all possible.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:16.440]   Let's see here.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.400]   Where did I end?
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:20.400]   Did I end with, we did the Yahoo?
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.680]   We did the downfall of the Mac, the AirPods.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.680]   Oh, the Snapchat.
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.920]   Now I know where we are.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:31.040]   I think, you know, it was five years ago,
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:35.440]   2011 that we moved into the Brickhouse.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.680]   At great expense.
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.760]   And thanks to all of you,
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.640]   who bought bricks to help that with that expense,
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.200]   we spent a million and a quarter dollars
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.680]   to build the Brickhouse Studios.
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:46.560]   Little did we know that the landlord
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:49.680]   would kick us out five years later
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:51.640]   so they could put a brew pub in there.
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:55.600]   Well, the good news for us is we found a new spot,
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:57.240]   the East Side Studios.
[01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:59.040]   We love it.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.040]   Here's our farewell to the old and ringing in the new.
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:07.520]   This, I am sad to say, is the last Twit we'll be doing
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:08.360]   in this studio.
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.200]   I'm glad you all,
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:11.520]   this great studio audience could be here for this.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:15.360]   We will next week be doing the very first show.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.640]   There's some question about that.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.520]   Since apparently there's an electrical issue,
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:20.760]   but we may be in the dark,
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.600]   but we will be doing it.
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.760]   Yeah, it might be outdoors.
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.600]   We'll be doing awesome.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:24.440]   We'll be doing awesome.
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.280]   We'll be doing awesome.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.120]   We'll be doing awesome.
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:26.960]   We'll be doing awesome.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:27.800]   Yeah, get a generator.
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:28.640]   Nice little hum in the background.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.480]   The entire world.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.320]   I will make it happen somehow.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.680]   We'll find a way to make that studio work next week.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.560]   So do tune in early
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:35.520]   because we'll be taking the trolley car
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.960]   over to the new studio at about,
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.280]   I'd say about 230,
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:42.640]   between two and 230 Pacific, five, five, 30 Eastern,
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:45.760]   21, 30 U.T.C.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.440]   Join us for Twit next week and every week.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.360]   If you can't be here live,
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:51.560]   you can always get after the fact on demand audio
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.000]   or video from our website,
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.120]   twit.tv or wherever you subscribe to podcasts.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:58.840]   Please subscribe and wanna make sure you don't miss an episode.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:00.760]   Thank you for being here and for the last time
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:01.600]   in the Twit Brickhouse,
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:04.600]   I say another Twit is in the can.
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:05.440]   Bye bye.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:08.020]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:08.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:11.280]   - There is nothing wrong with your Twit.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:14.120]   Do not attempt to close this browser.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.400]   We are controlling the stream.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.240]   We control the video.
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:19.760]   We control the audio.
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:25.240]   You are about to participate in a new online adventure.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:28.400]   You are about to experience the sights and sounds
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.360]   of the new Twit studio.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.880]   Please stand by.
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.020]   Five, four, three,
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:37.860]   (laughing)
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:38.700]   - We're mature.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:43.440]   - Man, this champagne popped a little bit early.
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.540]   (laughing)
[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:48.120]   (beeping)
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.680]   - This is Twit.
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:53.680]   - And we welcome you to the Twit East Side Studio
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.760]   still in beautiful downtown Petaluma.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:56.960]   Hello everybody.
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:59.240]   Our brand new studio is online and on the air
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.360]   and we are celebrating with champagne.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.560]   Alex Lindsey, can I pour you a little glass?
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.400]   - Yes please.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.160]   - We brought all in studio hosts today.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:08.280]   All of our staff hosts,
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.120]   there is Jason Howell from TNT.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:11.320]   - Fantastic. Thank you so much.
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:13.920]   - Yep, yep, yep. Father Robert Balisser.
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:16.200]   Are you allowed a little champagne once in a while?
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:17.840]   - If I drink from both hands at the same time.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.520]   - Just for a good time.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:22.840]   Paul Father Robert and also Megan Moroni.
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:26.400]   And I thought it'd be fun to start this new episode
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:28.400]   in our life with our hosts.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:31.320]   The people who come in every day and work so hard.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.600]   Formerly at the Brickhouse Studios now here
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:34.760]   in our new studios.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.240]   And it's a little rough.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:38.160]   If you're just tuning in, I gotta tell you,
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.400]   it's, you know, the engineers were up all night.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.800]   They've been up for several days,
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:44.600]   frankly, money of them.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.080]   Wiring and moving stuff over because I was mean.
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:48.920]   I was cruel.
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.320]   I said, I don't want to miss any shows.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.080]   I want to go as best we can as we did the last time
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:55.680]   from broadcasting at the Brickhouse to here
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:56.840]   at the East Side Studios.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:57.960]   And you know what, to their credit,
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:59.120]   they made it happen.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:02.120]   So a tip of the hat, John Slanina,
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:03.360]   to Alex Gumpel,
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:04.840]   (audience cheering)
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.000]   to Russell Tammany.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:11.280]   And to our engineering director, Bruce Chasm,
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.600]   to you, Patrick Delahandy,
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.640]   to all the people who work so hard behind the scenes
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.120]   to make this possible.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.440]   Let's toast the new Brickhouse.
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:21.560]   Sorry, East Side Studios.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.400]   Cheers.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.240]   Cheers.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.080]   Cheers.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.200]   - Cheers now.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:26.040]   - All right.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:29.160]   So if you're watching, and I know most of you listen,
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:29.960]   so if you're listening,
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.520]   you probably don't notice any difference, right?
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.560]   It looks the same to you.
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:33.400]   - Yeah.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:34.240]   - Yeah.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:35.560]   - They're like, I don't know what they're talking about.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:37.120]   - Dark red at the back of your eyelids
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.160]   are exactly the same.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.960]   For those of you watching on video,
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:40.960]   there's a little bit of a difference.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:42.320]   We brought the gear with us.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.440]   We brought the wall with us.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.760]   We brought the little thing behind us.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:47.200]   We have a new table.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.080]   This table, they promised me is impervious
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.440]   to any kind of abuse that we might give it.
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:55.680]   - That's a cop, I find that to be optimistic.
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.760]   (laughing)
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:59.160]   - Except that you have all of the audio controls
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.320]   for all of our microphones.
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.160]   - At my feet.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:02.320]   - Right underneath where you're still in.
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:03.240]   - Just what you wanted.
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:04.840]   - Just probably not there permanently.
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:05.680]   - It's going to power.
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:07.040]   - Probably not there permanently.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.600]   - No, I definitely didn't replace it.
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:09.880]   Hey, I also should thank,
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:10.960]   if I want to go home tonight,
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:12.960]   my wife, Lisa Laporta, CEO,
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:15.000]   the person who really made this all happen,
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.160]   who was the project director,
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:18.800]   and you should get some champagne too.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.440]   (laughing)
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:22.720]   (clapping)
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:25.640]   Without Lisa, we couldn't pay the bills.
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.760]   We wouldn't have this beautiful studio.
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:28.600]   She found it for us.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.880]   She managed the build out,
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:33.400]   and thank you, Lisa, for doing such a great job.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:34.960]   Thank you to everybody here in studio.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:36.920]   They've got a huge studio audience today.
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:39.080]   Some familiar faces, some new faces.
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:41.960]   Welcome to all of you to Petaluma.
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:44.480]   What do you think?
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.640]   You like it?
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:47.960]   We survived.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:52.160]   No, I don't think we lost anybody in the process.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:53.000]   - Sort of.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:53.880]   - Hey, this has been a lot of fun,
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.360]   but I think we got a party to go to.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.960]   I am really thrilled with how this worked.
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:00.000]   Thank you so much to our team.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.880]   They stayed up all night wiring,
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:03.720]   and getting this all working,
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:06.000]   and they did a fabulous job.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.120]   We really appreciate it.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:11.360]   Thanks to my team here at the table,
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:12.920]   the greatest Meghan Moroni.
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:16.000]   It's such a thrill to be able to continue to work with you
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:16.960]   after all this time,
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.960]   and keep making great stuff.
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.440]   We'll see you tomorrow for iOS today,
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.000]   and of course, Monday through Friday for TNT.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.600]   Father Robert Ballis there.
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:27.880]   The digital Jesuit, he's on loan from God,
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:31.480]   but we're glad to have him, and I don't know.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.320]   We've got everyone's your back.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:34.920]   - I'm on a missing from dad.
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.560]   - We had a mission from dad.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.640]   This weekend, Enterprise Tech.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.600]   Know how, am I missing anything?
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.720]   - Just the live events.
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:45.120]   - And great job, by the way, at IDF last week.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:46.200]   - That was fun.
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.920]   - At DefCon.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:48.720]   Where are you going next?
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:49.560]   What's the next live event?
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:50.400]   Are you on to EFA?
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.240]   - We're going to Berlin,
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:52.200]   to it will be at EFA,
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.920]   covering three days of the show.
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:54.760]   - That's exciting.
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:55.600]   - When's that?
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.440]   - How soon is that?
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:57.480]   - What, in a week and a half?
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:59.120]   - Wow, and you're taking Brian Burnett?
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:00.320]   - Brian Burnett and Colleen.
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.960]   Brian Burnett was going to be on this table.
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:03.040]   He's also one of our hosts,
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:05.120]   but he very kindly agreed to bow out,
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:08.400]   because apparently when they designed the table,
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.720]   they said, "Leo, who's the most number of people
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:13.600]   you would ever want to have on this show?"
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:15.360]   And I said, "We would never want more
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.440]   than five people on this show."
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.200]   And Chris, the very first show we do here,
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:20.760]   I wanted to have six people.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:23.000]   And John said, "You said five."
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.600]   So Brian, thank you.
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:25.440]   We love you, Brian.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.120]   We'll get you on to it real soon.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.120]   Thanks also to Alex.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.560]   - Lindsay, appreciate the 360 degree.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:31.520]   That's awesome.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:32.400]   - The wonderful gift.
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:33.240]   Thank you, Brian.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.080]   (all laughing)
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:36.240]   - I hope people watch it.
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:37.080]   - No problem.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:38.920]   - It's going to be on YouTube permanently, right?
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:40.760]   So people can go back and look at it.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:43.280]   - Yeah, and then we'll also take,
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:44.440]   we'll take some of the footage.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:45.600]   I don't know if we'll do the whole show,
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.920]   but we'll do an example that's in 4K stereo.
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:48.920]   - Right.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:51.000]   - That still takes a little time to.
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.600]   - Well.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:54.160]   - But people who are watching it were thrilled.
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.520]   It was fun for them to take a look around and see it.
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.360]   So we'll do some sort of 360.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:58:59.600]   - Yeah, we're still figuring it out.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.520]   Like, so a lot of it is we just like to figure out,
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.240]   put it in places and seeing what happens.
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:05.080]   - Yeah.
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:05.920]   - You know, like, you know, what's interesting.
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:06.760]   - It's really interesting.
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:07.600]   - Yeah.
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.400]   And of course, my good friend, Jason Howell,
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.800]   always a pleasure to have you, a host of TNT
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.280]   and all about Android.
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:16.160]   Thanks to all the people who came out today.
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:17.240]   It's been really great.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:18.400]   Thanks to all of you at home,
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.800]   who's put up with the disruption.
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.600]   I hope it hasn't been too bad.
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:25.080]   We plan on continuing all of our shows
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.040]   in our new East Side Studios.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.040]   You can come and watch us,
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.680]   email tickets@twit.tv,
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:31.920]   watch live 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern,
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:34.720]   2200 UTC every Sunday afternoon,
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.400]   or get your show on demand,
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:37.840]   audio and video of all of our shows
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.480]   available at our website, twit.tv
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:41.720]   or wherever you get your podcasts,
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:45.960]   subscribe and make sure you get every single episode.
[01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:46.800]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.680]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:48.840]   Another Twit.
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.240]   I'll see it one more time.
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:51.760]   It's in the can!
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:52.600]   Yeah!
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:54.120]   (audience applauds)
[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:54.960]   Thank you!
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:58.400]   Incidentally, just so you know,
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.760]   the new studios are the rents half as much.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:04.360]   The power bill is half as much.
[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:06.680]   We have all this, we lost one set,
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:07.840]   which we never used anywhere.
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:10.440]   This guy said, this set's the same.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.840]   My office is actually better.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.520]   And the staff is happier,
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:15.920]   because in the old set,
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.320]   they used to have to be quiet.
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:21.720]   Now they could talk and be loud down the hall.
[02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:25.200]   So anyway, we're in the brick house now.
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:26.600]   And thanks to everybody,
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:27.560]   the bricks by the way,
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.760]   came with us from the old studio.
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:30.960]   And we still haven't figured out
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:31.800]   where we're gonna put them,
[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:34.080]   but I think we're gonna put them on the wall outside.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:35.200]   We still have an open studio
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.720]   that we invite you to come by and visit.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:37.680]   You can visit your brick,
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.160]   you can visit the studio.
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:41.360]   Just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.720]   All right, let's wrap things up now
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:45.360]   with Kurt Wagner of Recode,
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:48.160]   Jason Snell of Six Colors,
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:49.600]   and my old friend,
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:53.720]   we can do her as Cali-Louis Luria Petrucci
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:58.600]   with a great discussion of live video.
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:01.240]   I'm really intrigued by this Facebook live thing.
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:03.560]   I think we're gonna talk a lot about video today.
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:04.640]   Facebook launched,
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:07.320]   again, I don't know if this is only on my app.
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:09.120]   So you guys can confirm this.
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:10.440]   My app has changed a lot.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:11.600]   This is the Facebook app.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.560]   And this is, you'll like this, Luria.
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:16.560]   Now in addition to newsfeed and people,
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:19.120]   there's a new video button that if I touch that,
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.720]   it shows video.
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:22.200]   Facebook is all in.
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:23.040]   Well, look at that.
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:24.400]   You're right there.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:26.480]   I was doing one earlier this morning.
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:27.320]   How about that?
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:28.640]   Facebook is all in on video,
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:30.680]   the point where they're surfacing it
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:32.640]   as an equal to the newsfeed.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:35.880]   Yeah, well, Mark Zuckerberg came out recently and said,
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.920]   I mean, at the FA conference,
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:41.440]   he was talking about how important live video is to them.
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:45.080]   And they are freaking killing it in the live streaming space.
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.920]   You know, Leo, you've been doing live streaming for years.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:49.440]   You do it kind of on a more--
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.760]   I'm going to buy a full page ad in the New York Times
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:54.440]   that says, welcome Facebook, seriously.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:57.920]   But with mobile live streaming,
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.400]   I mean, they're really doing a whole lot in that space.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:04.080]   And so we wanted to make sure that we were kind of in that
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.560]   and killing it in that space as well.
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:12.360]   So we actually-- we figured out how to use a live stream HD 550
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:13.560]   studio box in order for--
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:14.600]   So that's my question.
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.480]   Because I know how to do this because it
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:19.080]   has a go live button right here.
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.840]   And I can just go live from my phone.
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:23.280]   And that's actually interesting because that's also
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.920]   been around in this.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.680]   But it was a little harder to find.
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:28.000]   If you wanted to post to Facebook,
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.240]   you'd have to tap what's on your mind and then scroll down.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:32.360]   And then you'd see the go live.
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.000]   In fact, for a while, I didn't even
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.880]   think this was in the Facebook for Android version.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:38.520]   But now they've--
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.440]   That just was released like two days ago.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:40.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:43.120]   But now-- and they've really because of this video.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:44.720]   And so everybody has this video button now.
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:45.480]   You have it, Jason?
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:45.760]   No.
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:46.360]   No.
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:47.520]   Not on iOS yet.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.840]   They're rolling it out, I believe.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:51.600]   I think they announced it a few weeks ago, right,
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:53.160]   before F8.
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:53.600]   And then--
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:54.440]   Probably slow roll out.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.000]   Tell me, Kirk, if you have this,
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.600]   because on the bottom of my Facebook, this is new too.
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:01.080]   I have categories.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.160]   So I have newsfeed.
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:05.040]   But I also have world and US news.
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:06.200]   Funny.
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:08.600]   There's a whole bunch of subject matter.
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:12.040]   And I can even turn it on or off with the Settings button.
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:14.800]   I'm thinking I must be in some sort of beta test of this.
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:15.800]   Sorry, it's so bright.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:17.400]   I should turn my screen brightness down.
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.160]   I think you're getting this-- not necessarily something
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.720]   that's totally, totally new.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.280]   I know that people have written about that
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:25.800]   is a few months ago.
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:27.680]   But at the same time, I don't have that.
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:29.640]   A lot of people I've seen have not had it.
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:32.000]   So I do think you're one of the lucky few.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.320]   They somehow picked you.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:34.760]   I don't know if I feel so lucky.
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:36.040]   Test all of you did.
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:39.720]   It's interesting, though, because what it really tells me,
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:43.160]   both this scroll bar at the bottom and the new video
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:45.640]   category at the top is that Facebook
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:50.520]   wants to be a media company, not a social network.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:51.040]   Right, Kurt?
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:53.440]   Is that fair to say?
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:55.840]   I think that they want to do a lot of stuff.
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:00.200]   And if you were at FA, you could see that ultimately,
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:01.940]   the one thing I will give Facebook
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:05.120]   is that they really stay true to that mission, which
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.560]   is about connecting people.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:07.440]   And it sounds a little corny.
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.800]   It sounds a little cliche.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:10.440]   But everything that they do, right?
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:14.720]   I mean, the fact that they're trying to set up Wi-Fi-enabled
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:17.720]   cities, they're going to test something in San Jose,
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:20.160]   California around that, the fact that they're
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:21.560]   having internet beaming drones.
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.480]   It's all about getting people onto the internet,
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:26.360]   and therefore connecting them with the different apps
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:27.240]   that they have.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:30.280]   I think the way that they keep you coming back
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.440]   is through the media and entertainment part of it, right?
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.400]   Because I'm only going to log on to Facebook
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:37.800]   if I'm exchanging a message or if I have a comment on something
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:38.760]   that I posted.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:40.800]   But the reason I open the app every single day,
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.760]   even when I don't have those things happening,
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:45.760]   is because there's great videos and there's great stories
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.160]   and all these other things that I read.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:49.160]   So I don't know if they would describe themselves
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:54.680]   as a media company, but they've married media and communication
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:56.200]   in a way that hardly--
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:57.560]   I don't think anyone else is really done.
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:01.160]   I think Snapchat's trying to do it, but that's about it.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.440]   And I'll add on to that, Kurt.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:04.800]   That's a very good point.
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.440]   But because of their ad platform and how prominent that is
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:11.360]   and how much money they make off of it,
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:13.160]   that's a big deal for them.
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:16.280]   They have to keep that attention coming back
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:19.200]   over and over and over in order to make sure
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:24.640]   that people continue to have effectiveness with those ads.
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:29.800]   And of course, they're putting so much effort
[02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:32.120]   into people who use that.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:35.200]   You almost can't necessarily be effective
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:39.440]   if you don't use it, which is kind of a negative.
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:42.720]   But if you have high engagement, you can kind of get over that.
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:44.840]   So I saw somebody in the chat room.
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:48.480]   I'm sorry, I missed your name a minute ago who said
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:50.720]   they're focusing on celebrities.
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:52.560]   And they always start with celebrities.
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:55.640]   Then they always kind of roll it out to the masses.
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:57.320]   Facebook Live is for everybody now.
[02:05:57.320 --> 02:05:59.160]   And it's not just for less celebrities.
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:00.160]   Well, they're paying--
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:00.760]   They're paying--
[02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:01.760]   They're paying something.
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:02.880]   They're paying celebrities.
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:05.160]   And they're paying some media partners too.
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.240]   So that's something that, as far as I know,
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:11.200]   Twitter and Periscope have never been willing to do.
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:15.640]   And I think you're going to assume certain things.
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:17.480]   OK, Facebook's now paying for this.
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:20.080]   Eventually, they're going to want to pull that back
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:22.120]   and figure out another way, because you
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:24.480]   can't afford to pay people for content forever.
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:27.800]   But at the same time, you look at all the people who
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:30.160]   are broadcasting on Facebook Live in the last three months.
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:31.880]   I mean, it wasn't even a thing.
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:33.720]   Basically, we didn't even talk about this
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:36.080]   at the turn of the year at January 1.
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:38.480]   Now, every single publisher and every single media property
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:41.200]   around is going live on a regular basis.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.000]   So it's working.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.760]   And the problem is like, OK, now can they transition from,
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:47.640]   hey, we've been paying you all along to, we want you to do
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:50.600]   this because you want to do it, not because we're giving you
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:50.940]   money.
[02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:53.120]   And so they're going to have to figure out a way to monetize
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.000]   it in a way that keeps that incentivized.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.600]   Facebook's not paying you, Kelly, right?
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.080]   This is a platform for you.
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:02.680]   But I wonder, do you worry about going all in as you have
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:03.400]   on Facebook?
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.960]   Because it's not--
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:05.560]   So--
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:05.920]   I mean, it's--
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:07.400]   Yeah, that's about--
[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:08.800]   You're a platform.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:09.600]   Right, exactly.
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:13.880]   You never want to go all in on somebody else's platform.
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:14.080]   I'm not--
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:15.480]   Well, just risky.
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:16.320]   It is risky.
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:19.760]   I mean, you can if you have a strategy behind you
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:24.400]   to get people on to your own platform, right?
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:25.360]   And that's the way we use it.
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:28.400]   So you're using it as a way to promote what you're doing
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.720]   elsewhere.
[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:30.800]   Not fully.
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:31.640]   I mean, yes.
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:34.400]   So we have that strategy in place.
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:39.360]   And we always drive traffic to our own properties.
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.120]   So from a business perspective, you
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:44.080]   have to think about that kind of thing.
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:48.640]   From a content perspective, you don't get our content live
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.800]   unless you are their live on Facebook.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:54.680]   We do hope-- we do release that content later.
[02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:56.000]   Well, it stays on Facebook, right?
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.480]   I mean, people can now see it--
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:57.760]   Exactly.
[02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:01.000]   If you're in My Feed, I missed the first show.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.400]   But I can see it because it's in My Feed.
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:03.480]   Jason, would you--
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:05.200]   you're a content creator as much as anybody.
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:09.360]   Would you consider creating a Facebook-specific show live
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:10.080]   on Facebook?
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:12.520]   I think you have to consider the power of Facebook
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:13.960]   and its ability to reach an audience.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:15.760]   But at the same time, I also think
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:17.360]   a lot of video producers are already
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:21.280]   dealing with a major platform that
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.520]   is taking up a lot of their oxygen, which is YouTube, right?
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:25.920]   But it's different because YouTube--
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:28.440]   you create a show, and then you put it on YouTube.
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:31.080]   YouTube is a distribution medium for you.
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.160]   Facebook-- this is why I might disagree with you, Kurt.
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:36.640]   I think Facebook does want to be a media company.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:40.280]   I understand that their business is broader than that.
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:41.720]   But when you see them paying people,
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:43.880]   I think they want to incent people too.
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:46.040]   They want to be--
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:50.680]   they want to be the place you go for information,
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.960]   for entertainment, for everything.
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:53.760]   They want to be the platform for internet content
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:54.560]   for all their users.
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:59.880]   And in fact, we know most people now get their news on Facebook.
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:04.120]   So don't you think maybe there's some--
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:05.400]   why?
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.200]   You said a couple of things that were provocative, I thought,
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:07.360]   Kurt.
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:09.160]   One is that Facebook can't keep paying them.
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:10.880]   Why not?
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:13.400]   I just don't think that it's sustainable.
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.840]   They got lots of money, don't they?
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:16.240]   Sure.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:18.400]   I guess perhaps, sustainable is wrong.
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:18.960]   You're right.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:21.120]   I mean, they could continue to pay.
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.400]   I don't think it's good business.
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:26.640]   So I think what they're going to be inspired to do or driven
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:30.640]   to do is say, OK, now that you've gotten on the platform,
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.280]   you're comfortable with how this works.
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:34.720]   You've seen the audience that we can drive because we're
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:35.240]   Facebook.
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:36.920]   And we should talk about the algorithm, too,
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:39.680]   because that's a whole another thing that I think
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:40.760]   Facebook has.
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:41.760]   YouTube does some of that.
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:43.920]   But I think this is Facebook's bread and butter, right?
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:46.160]   Is that they can basically show you what they want to show you.
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:47.680]   So let's set that aside for a second.
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:50.880]   But you get these publishers comfortable
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:52.440]   going live on Facebook.
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:55.680]   And then you say, all right, how can we both make money here
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:01.200]   so that we're not losing money on this content project,
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.040]   if you will?
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:02.480]   And so--
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:06.480]   I already said that they're going to start paying producers
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:08.120]   for that content.
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:09.520]   But it's not what that--
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.520]   That's what they're doing now.
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:11.320]   But I think--
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:15.560]   I mean, revenue split for all users,
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:18.600]   as opposed to just paying celebrities.
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:19.440]   You know what I mean?
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.480]   But revenue split's different.
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:22.000]   So that's what YouTube does, right?
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.840]   We're going to put ads on it, and you get some of that money,
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:25.760]   and we'll get the rest of it.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.440]   And I think that's what Facebook will ultimately--
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:28.880]   That's what they want to do, too.
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:30.360]   Yeah, they haven't--
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:31.080]   That's OK.
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.320]   So that might be the distinction between a media company
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:35.600]   and a social media company.
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:38.920]   Because if you're CBS, you pay people
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:42.840]   to make content to put on CBS that you could put ads around.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:45.680]   And CBS can't go to Louis C.K.
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:47.520]   and say, we'll do a rev share with you.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.040]   We'll put some ads on there, and we'll give you 5%.
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:52.520]   That's not how it works.
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:55.120]   Is that-- I mean, is it a media company if you do that?
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:56.440]   Is YouTube a media company?
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:57.240]   I don't know.
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:00.000]   We may be splitting hairs a little bit, or at least
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.520]   identifying how confusing this whole thing is.
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:08.000]   But I think the way the slight or subtle difference
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.920]   that I think about is traditionally,
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:13.280]   Facebook has preached that it's a platform, right?
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:15.440]   It is not the one creating any of this.
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:18.480]   Yes, it may be at this point even paying CNN.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:20.920]   But it is not coming out and saying, we're going to create
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:21.640]   a new show--
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.760]   They don't want to be Netflix.
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.480]   They don't want to create originals.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:27.560]   I think they want to host as much great content as they can,
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:29.760]   because that's where they can sell advertising.
[02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:32.640]   But I don't think that they want to be seen as--
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:36.000]   even though we all, again, the algorithm, they choose what we see.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.720]   They don't want us to think that they choose what they--
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:39.200]   we see.
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:41.280]   They want us to think that everything in our newsfeed
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:44.120]   is there because it's tailored towards us.
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:47.160]   And there's an almighty algorithm that picks us for us.
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:50.400]   But Facebook is in control of all that.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:54.280]   And it's very easy to forget that they have essentially a say
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:56.680]   in what succeeds and what fails on Facebook.
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:59.040]   And right now, they want live video to succeed.
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:02.520]   And that's why it's doing so well.
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:04.160]   Well, wow, that was a lot.
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:05.240]   We had a lot of fun this year.
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:07.360]   And we are going to have even more fun in 2017.
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:09.640]   I want to thank you all so much.
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:13.600]   Twits the first show we started doing in 2005.
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:17.520]   We were entering our 12th year this year.
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:22.160]   And with more viewers, more listeners,
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:25.160]   your support has been fantastic every year.
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:25.920]   It's been growing.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:28.760]   And I'm just very grateful personally.
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:31.400]   And I think I could speak on behalf of our team,
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:34.720]   was also growing quite a bit.
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:36.640]   When I started to it, it was just me.
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.800]   I was about 25 people who work here.
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:41.920]   And we couldn't do it without you and your support
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:45.560]   and your listening and your support of our advertisers.
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.280]   So thank you very much.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:49.200]   I hope you've enjoyed this year.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:51.160]   Or last year, I guess now it is.
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:54.040]   I hope you enjoy the new 2017.
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:57.520]   I promise you lots of great shows all over the networking
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:59.400]   right here every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:02.760]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2300 UTC
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:05.880]   for this week in tech.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:08.040]   We'll have a brand new show for you January 8.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.720]   I hope you'll stop by and say hi one week for today.
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:11.560]   Thanks for being here.
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:16.880]   And now I guess I have to say it for the 595th time.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:19.600]   Sixth, good because five makes no sense.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:24.400]   For the 596th time, another Twit is in the can.
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:25.160]   Happy new year.
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:25.960]   We'll see you soon.
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:26.960]   This is amazing.
