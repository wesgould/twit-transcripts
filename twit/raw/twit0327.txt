[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.080]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.960]   And we are going to cover the week's tech news
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.600]   with a massively beautiful, wonderful panel
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840]   of Middle-Aged white men.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.720]   What can I say?
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.760]   Starting with Brian Brussman, you're not quite Middle-Aged.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.520]   You know, somebody said this was a sausage party.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.000]   I thought they were talking about the catering.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.760]   Yeah, well, that too.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.680]   We are having a barbecue now.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.520]   And there are sausage.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.400]   Twit is in town for our new gaming show,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   which we're going to kind of bait a test after the show.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.280]   But he's also the host of so many other shows,
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.320]   including Scam School and Revision 3,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.400]   and our great NSFW show, which is--
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.000]   Absolutely.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.480]   Yeah, just crossed over 100 episodes.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.160]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160]   Had you on as a guest.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.360]   So if you want to see Leo even goofier than you--
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.480]   Spider Belmont almost--
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.040]   Spider Belmont.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.080]   Almost killed me.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.040]   You show, that's right.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.200]   We can't bother Veronica.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.440]   She's in the studio, but she's writing her novel.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.880]   She's really writing during the show?
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.880]   She's writing for the novel.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   When there's a scene about Middle-Aged white people
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.600]   talking about--
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.080]   I said--
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.920]   I will know where this guy's from.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.760]   Look, help us.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.160]   We need a female.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.440]   We need some diversity on the panel.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.400]   She said, I can't.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.240]   I'm writing my novel.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.840]   She's doing NaNoWriMo, right?
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.440]   This is the November National Novel Writing Month.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.880]   There he is, a novel writer himself.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.720]   Mr. Tom Merritt.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.760]   Multiple novels.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.480]   Tom's writing his seventh novel this month.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.640]   Tom does NaNoWriMo every year.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.160]   None of them any good.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.960]   Every year, don't you?
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.680]   Yeah, I try it every year.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.040]   I've done it.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.000]   I've finished it twice.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.480]   That's awesome.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.240]   I'm on track again.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.720]   Tom is a host of TNT, of course, on the Twit Network
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.240]   every day, our daily fix of tech news at 230 Pacific 530
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.560]   Eastern.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.200]   Boiling Point, was that a NaNoWriMo?
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.000]   No, that was just your first novel.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.040]   Yeah, that was just me.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.360]   And you just had a reading.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.800]   United Moon colonies, I did as a National Novel Writing Month.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.160]   And I read-- that was the one I read.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.720]   That's awesome.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.600]   You live streamed it too.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.440]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.800]   Tony Wang actually from Twit came out in the magazine.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   I'm so glad you did that.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.920]   Yeah, I apologize for missing it.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.640]   I lost track of it.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.080]   It was all right.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.040]   Yeah, it was just one of those things.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.720]   It looked like it was fun.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.240]   It was.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.640]   It was good.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.320]   It looked like everyone is dressed in Edwardian fashion.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.240]   Yeah, and snapping as a--
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.600]   Did they?
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   Like a people?
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.720]   Edward Edwardian beatniks.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.200]   Patrick Norton is here, my buddy from the screen savers.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.680]   Of course, he hosts Tekzilla with Veronica at Tekzilla.com.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.320]   Good to see you.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.080]   Thanks for coming.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.640]   Pleasure to be here.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.160]   Patrick has been very obstinious.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.560]   He didn't try the--
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.400]   Wow.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   I do that for John because there's meat outside.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.280]   And you avoided the meat because you didn't want
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.600]   to have little bits of flesh in your teeth.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.640]   Well, there's nothing worse than you
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.000]   looking towards me turning white and running for buckets.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.240]   Anyway, I hope before you leave, you'll have some.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.320]   I will be glad to eat it.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.280]   We are having a wonderful barbecue.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.640]   I'll tell you about that in a second,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.680]   but first John C. Devorek, who we did not expect today.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.840]   I'm telling you, I confirmed.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.880]   I'm glad you did.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.960]   We're glad you're here.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.440]   This is a wonderful panel.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.040]   Good to have you all.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.440]   I'm at channeldevorek.com.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.600]   And he's also the host of Noah Geneshow at nogenesshow.com.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.800]   And I just gave you some Noah Geneshow playing cards.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.440]   Yes, which concerns me deeply because--
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.280]   You don't know about them.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.120]   No.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.760]   It's got you--
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.480]   Maybe somebody sent me a note, but I never got the cards.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.320]   And you have the cards.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.680]   Well, this is a way of saying you've already
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.320]   texted your lawyer and your lawyer's contacting the game.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.680]   No, actually, our show is open source.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.120]   It's open source.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   It's open source.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.240]   Look, there's John C. Devorek.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.000]   He's Buzzkill.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   There's crackpot, Adam Curry.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.640]   And then these are all Noah Gened album art cards.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.760]   And there's a whole game associated with it.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.520]   Actually, it looks pretty fun.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   Maybe later, we could play for three to eight players.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.840]   Yeah, we should play it.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.480]   That would really liven the show up.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.560]   Go fish.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.880]   I don't think you say go fish.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.840]   You say karma.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.240]   Karma can.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.480]   Anyway, no, I'll give these to you.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.440]   I don't know where they came from.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.560]   They just appeared one day.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.640]   I'm sure we'll find out.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.960]   I thought it was a bar of soap.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.840]   I opened it when it wasn't.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.680]   I almost threw it away.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.320]   So it's a good thing that I--
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.640]   What do you need soap?
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.520]   You're looking for soap?
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.320]   I was looking for--
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.160]   You keep the soap.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.200]   Free soap, I thought.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.120]   You know, what could I--
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.480]   OK, first shower in the morning.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.320]   You've got a shower in the morning.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.720]   Anyway, we are having a barbecue.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.680]   And I want to thank everybody who came from--
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.280]   frankly, all over the Bay Area.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.400]   It's really nice to have you.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.840]   Who's came here for the farthest, though?
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.440]   Somebody's here from Israel, I believe.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.940]   Wow.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.440]   There you go.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.960]   It's from Israel.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.240]   Who came all the way specifically for the show from Israel?
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.560]   No.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.320]   He's actually a developer.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.400]   He writes mobile applications.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.120]   What's the name of it?
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.960]   Car Buzz.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.480]   Have you ever seen Car Buzz?
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.000]   Car Buzz?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.280]   You would actually like Car Buzz.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.760]   I'd like Car Buzz Kill.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.800]   Yeah, you're Buzz Kill.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.880]   But Car Buzz is the app on Android, iPhone.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.760]   You should take a look at it.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.960]   It's like--
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.720]   What does it do?
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.600]   It's a magazine, like a car magazine.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.160]   Oh.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.320]   On app.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.680]   Who else?
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.960]   Anybody from anywhere else from outside the US?
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.280]   Or just outside of California?
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.000]   Mostly local, because it's a barbecue.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.640]   And we wanted people who would be nearby.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.320]   We got a great caterer out front.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.640]   We've got a jumpy jump.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.320]   We've got tents.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.640]   We took over the street.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.040]   You did.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.220]   Pretty neat.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.520]   For that?
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.920]   Yeah, we did.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.640]   We paid a--
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.360]   Battle in the police department.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.160]   Paid the bribe?
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.200]   No, it's not a bribe.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.920]   I believe there's a process that you go through.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.480]   It's called permitting, Tom.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   Right.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.480]   And much of the construction on my house was not permitted.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.560]   This is all--
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.120]   You don't perish the thought.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.320]   No, no, no, permitted.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.800]   Everything permitted.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.680]   And if you notice, I'm wearing a purple armband.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.400]   That's not a style statement.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.680]   That's actually so I can eat meat.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.960]   If you don't have-- you all have the purple armband.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   That's just a--
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.280]   You're wearing that healthy thing.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.840]   What's up?
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.680]   Oh, this is the up.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.360]   The jaw bone up.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.640]   The up.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.240]   How do you like it?
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.320]   I was hoping you'd notice.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.880]   What is this?
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.480]   It's like you've got to get--
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.120]   This is cool.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.640]   This is really--
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.600]   It's like a Fitbit.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.760]   You're more annoying.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.240]   And by the way, Jon, you know how Liv's drawing.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.840]   Everybody was wearing the Liv's drawing.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.560]   This is-- you remember this day, the first time
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.600]   you saw this thing.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.200]   In a year, everybody's going to be wearing it.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.360]   Have you had to recharge it?
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.320]   Because there's been a lot of talk on Twitter
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.480]   that the first time you recharge it, it dies.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.280]   No, I have recharges several times.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   So maybe they got a bad one.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.160]   This is from jaw bone.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.080]   Those guys do the Bluetooth.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.920]   Here, I'll show you.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.200]   The Bluetooth--
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.880]   Head sets.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.720]   Head sets, yeah.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.080]   And this is not Bluetooth.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.160]   In fact, it's kind of weird.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.840]   The way it works is you have to have an iPhone.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.240]   There's no point in having it if you don't have an iPhone.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.120]   It uses the audio jack and the iPhone.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.320]   But it comes with a USB charger that plugs into that.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.720]   So you plug that into your computer.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.640]   It charges very quickly.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.560]   It goes about 60 days.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.040]   What does it do?
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.720]   It is a pedometer in its basis form.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.360]   You know who made the technology in here?
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.960]   It's called MotionX, Philippe Kahn.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   Oh, he's doing something.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.120]   Philippe's amazing.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.960]   So Philippe Kahn, you all remember-- maybe you don't--
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.440]   from Borland, right?
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.320]   He wrote Turbo or produced Turbo Pascal,
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   which transformed an industry.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.560]   By the way, I just saw a page.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.600]   Do you remember-- you're too young.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.560]   No, I remember Pascal.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.440]   He's three people out of me.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.200]   I had the--
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:02.800]   Is he really?
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.400]   I think so.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.600]   I just feel like you're so young.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   Maybe it's the spiky hair.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.520]   I'm clearly compensating for my age.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.640]   You don't notice my crow's feet.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.200]   When you're growing up, the beard will see
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.700]   the gray.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.400]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.720]   Oh, it's got a gray beard.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   Wow.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.560]   So the thing that excites me the most
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.080]   is that it's a pedometer.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.240]   It's got an accelerometer.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.560]   So if you're riding a bike or running,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.080]   it tracks all of that stuff.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.600]   It does.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.320]   I don't know how well a pedometer on your wrist
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.600]   is going to work, to be honest with you.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.240]   So that'll remain to be seen how accurate that is.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.240]   But it also tracks how well you sleep,
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.440]   and how much you move around.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.840]   So you push a button on here.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.160]   This is the button and set when you're
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.840]   going to go to sleep.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.120]   You say, I'm in sleep mode.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.400]   And then it will pull up--
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.800]   I should show you-- I have it on my iPhone.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.840]   I can show you what it looks like.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.600]   The app, which is free, is called up.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.640]   The device is called up.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.160]   It's from Java.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160]   It's 100 bucks.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.960]   Oh, I'm paying attention to that Scrabble game.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.720]   I covered it.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.280]   I don't want you to see how dumb I am.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.360]   So this is my activity.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   I've had 1,136 steps today.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.600]   This is how many miles I went.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.000]   This is how many-- oh, actually.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.640]   Oh, no, that's not today.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.960]   That's this afternoon.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.200]   So this is a graph.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.160]   That's the food I take pictures of your food.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.200]   But here's my sleep cycle.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   Let's tap that.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.360]   So the orange is awake.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.600]   The light blue is light sleep.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.560]   And the dark blue is the REM sleep that you want.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.720]   You can see I only got 74% sleep.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.240]   This Fitbit does this too.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.320]   Now, do you have any memory of these moments
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.480]   that it says that you're awake?
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.280]   I don't remember.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:25.880]   That's amazing.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.400]   No, I did.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.640]   That's what-- OK.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.200]   How is that amazing?
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.080]   I got-- because this is--
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.120]   No, I do remember.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.480]   --with all the things my body does right.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.760]   That I don't even know.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.040]   This is when I got up to P.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.640]   Oh, an old man.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.440]   OK?
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.120]   I'm an old man.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.400]   I didn't want to talk about it, but you put me on the spot.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   So anyway, I--
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.440]   He does remember that.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.360]   I do remember that.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.800]   Does it track that?
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.320]   Analyze it.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.160]   There's a little cup.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.800]   Do you take a picture?
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.440]   So and then you have a team of people
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.360]   that also are using this.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.880]   And you can see how they're doing.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.040]   I can see how Gregory slept.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.480]   I can see how Gary slept.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.000]   That kind of thing.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.160]   He'd make sleep and bed better than a Fitbit, right?
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.920]   The idea is to make this a competitive sport.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.360]   Fitbit does that actually as well.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.840]   I slept that.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.640]   Hell, I--
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.240]   And then you can give each other challenges.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.640]   The thing that the iPhone app is actually kind of smart
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.840]   because you take pictures of your food as you're going.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.440]   And then you also register how you feel after you had that meal.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.560]   I don't know if that would be of use, but it's interesting.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.760]   So here's people putting their status updates.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.360]   There's Gary's status update.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:25.720]   I don't know.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.760]   I think this--
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.360]   I could take a photo of my meal, choose a meal photo from Library,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.960]   work out with Band.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.200]   I don't have a Band, but if I have a Band, I'll work out with them.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   Sure.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.440]   Work out with GPS.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.240]   That's kind of cool.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.960]   If you have your phone with you, it will take--
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.000]   the phone will take a track.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.680]   This app will take a track of your work out,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.640]   and then upload it to the Fit to the--
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.840]   Nike Plus does that.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.360]   Yeah, it's like Nike Plus.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.680]   So it combines Fitbit, Nike Plus, a food tracker,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.640]   sleep tracker-- it's interesting.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.160]   And it seems wireless, right?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   You don't have to plug it in.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   No, unlike the Fitbit, you have to plug it into Syncit.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.960]   That's a little bit of a decision.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.640]   Because right now, I'm using a whole bunch of different apps.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.000]   I use the Nike Plus when--
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.520]   by the way, I highly recommend if you ride a bike,
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.480]   get the Nike Plus jogging app because it's so impressive to you.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.960]   It's like, that's your best marathon.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   You're fast.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.720]   You just went to--
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.040]   26 miles in three litibits.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   Exactly.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   So Sync's just by putting it in there like that.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.080]   It's syncing right now.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.760]   It's not bad.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.320]   It's very quick.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.240]   And you don't have to sync all the time.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.440]   The one other thing that it does that the Fitbit doesn't do,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.040]   it will watch your sleep cycle and will--
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.800]   you set an alarm.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.120]   So you set your alarm for a half hour time frame.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.480]   And when your sleep is lightest,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.440]   it will wake you up by vibrating the bracelet.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.600]   Oh, that's right.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.200]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.120]   What's the benefit of that?
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.640]   You don't wake up when you're in deep REM sleep.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.280]   You know how you wake up if you're in really deep sleep
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.640]   and your groggy if the alarm goes off.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.120]   You feel more rested because they pick when you're lightest
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.160]   and just sort of nudge you.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.240]   Like, "Hake it up."
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.080]   I was already up when it buzzed this morning, so--
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.040]   The morning.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.880]   In the morning, John.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.800]   Get some catchphrase.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.840]   What if you need to get up?
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.320]   Because it just waits until you--
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.000]   What if you're just dead out?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.520]   You're never going to wake up for days.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.200]   Well, eventually it gives up, I guess.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.480]   I don't know.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.400]   You set it up.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.760]   It's a half hour time frame.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.840]   I'll let you know.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.800]   Apparently, nobody does REM sleep for that life.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.960]   I don't know how we got into this.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   Anyway, that's what that is.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.520]   You got into it because you said everyone's going to want one.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.120]   I have a feeling this is going to be huge.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   It's the beginning.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.040]   It's the beginning swell up when it gets rainwater.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.840]   It's the beginning of a revolution in personal health
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.440]   monitoring.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.240]   You know, I already-- when I weigh myself in tweets,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.000]   when I take my blood pressure at tweets--
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.840]   Yeah, and when the company that's collecting this data
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.960]   sends it to the insurance company tweets,
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.440]   that your rates have just gone out.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.840]   I'm a little worried about that.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.120]   Do you think that'll-- no.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.360]   Yes.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.800]   It's not medically reliable.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.400]   They can't use that.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:31.880]   They can't.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.600]   Yes, they don't need it.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   They don't have to be reliable.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.440]   Any reason at all.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.240]   Any reason they got it.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.920]   They did raise my rates like 13%.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.480]   So fake bomb.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.560]   Because you get your rates on and signed on to that thing.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.120]   If they'll use it anyway, then--
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.760]   No, I should exercise.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.240]   I should exercise.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.800]   I should exercise.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.760]   I don't think they're ever the day.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.320]   I should exercise.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:44.960]   Yes, it's another thing.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.280]   Don't get those shopping cars.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.600]   They just-- those go right to the insurance companies.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.440]   Like if I buy donuts.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.520]   You bought more red meat?
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.240]   Holy mackerel.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.000]   Look at the donuts.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.880]   This guy eats.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.800]   Jack is rates.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.400]   He's going to be dead.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.920]   That's why--
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.160]   If we just had a single pair health plan, John,
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.240]   we wouldn't have to worry.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.320]   I believe what it is like on average-- and I'm somebody who
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   has to pay for his own health-- I don't know how we're on health
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:03.680]   care.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   But the rate--
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.160]   Why not?
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.400]   This is quit, don't you know?
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   Not maybe do that.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.400]   No, that's not.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.240]   I'll try to do the-- I'll try to give on track, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.120]   I'll do what I can.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.960]   That's why we love you, John.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.760]   Go ahead.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.440]   Oh, no, I was just going to say, from what I understand,
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.360]   it's illegal to jack up the rates of any one person.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.920]   But that's why they do these groups, right?
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.760]   So you start a group, and then the group as a whole, you know,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.080]   20% every year, year after year.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.960]   Oh, I thought that.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.240]   But they recently raised my rates more than they
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.680]   raised the rest of the company's rates.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.000]   Is that illegal?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.840]   I don't know.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   They said--
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   It certainly do shoot.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.400]   The rationale was, well, we're such a small group,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.080]   because we're only 20 people.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.480]   Oh, well, in that case.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.720]   So my rates were actually raised over everybody else's.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.760]   Well, they could do that because of your-- if they have
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.720]   your health information, and you fit one of the groups
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.360]   that he's talking about, I guess.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:46.880]   I don't know.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.680]   It seems wrong.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.000]   But you know, health care.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.720]   How much is that thing?
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.960]   $99.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.920]   Same as a Fitbit.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.320]   It's really comparable to the Fitbit.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.560]   That's not going to replace Livestrong.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.120]   The reason-- the reason I like it is because I've lost
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.800]   three Fitbits, because they're on your belt,
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   and it's easy to lose.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.040]   I don't know if they can't do that.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.400]   I heard audible gals, but you used to--
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.600]   you lost three Fitbits.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.080]   I know.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.680]   People were like, oh.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.880]   Well, there's one at the San Diego Zoo.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.840]   It was by the--
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   It was by the--
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   It was by the--
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.040]   It was by the Tanger.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.960]   It was by the Tanger.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.560]   And that's going to the insurance company.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.840]   This guy is only--
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   There's a lot of guys--
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   This guy is--
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.480]   But Nana is hunking this be.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.640]   Lots of bananas.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.120]   So actually, there's some--
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.800]   I think sad news to start the show with it just broke.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.040]   This is very sad.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.720]   You all know about Diaspora, which
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.400]   was founded about a year ago as a Kickstarter project
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.640]   to compete with Facebook.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.720]   They wanted to make an open Facebook the idea being
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.280]   it would be federated so anybody could run a Diaspora
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:45.640]   server.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.680]   They'd all speak together.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.120]   Nobody would own the data.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.040]   It's exactly like Google+.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.680]   If you log into Diaspora and look at it,
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.480]   it is like a mirror image.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.200]   Google+ looks exactly like that.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.280]   So you're saying Google+ stole it?
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   I'm not saying that.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.800]   I think there aren't that many different ways
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.680]   to do a social network.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.000]   But it is Google+.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.800]   It works exactly like that.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.640]   It's funny because I haven't used it.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.480]   I gave him 100 bucks when I left--
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.400]   Join Diaspora.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.200]   Join Diaspora.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   Not get Diaspora.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.320]   Let me type that right.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.720]   But yeah, it works exactly the same way as Google+.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.880]   I think there may actually be a relationship between the two.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.240]   That's why I don't want to accuse them of stealing.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.320]   The kids that did this, they were all, I think, NYU students.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.520]   They went to Kickstarter to raise the money
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.640]   and raised a huge amount of money.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.160]   In fact, Mark Zuckerberg even gave him some money.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.160]   Wow.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.640]   Join Diaspora.com.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.920]   They're calling it the Diaspora Alpha.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.160]   The sad story is, we believe, according to all things D,
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.000]   that one of the founders, I think
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.240]   they were four 21-year-old, passed away yesterday.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.280]   So, Iliya Jitormiskeli.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.880]   And no word on what happened.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.400]   But very sad.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.240]   I did not know him.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.520]   I had not met him.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.880]   And I think there were some struggles
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.720]   that Diaspora was going through.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.640]   But apparently he passed away at a very young age.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.160]   So--
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   Only one.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.560]   Not sure exactly--
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.960]   Yeah, they haven't reported the cause of death.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.400]   What happened?
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   Anyway, so very sad.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.120]   I don't know how this affects the future of Diaspora,
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.040]   or even if that's something to worry about at this point.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.200]   I really wished him well.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.120]   I think the competition is a good thing.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.680]   And I think it's good that Google+ is here, too.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.360]   Moving on, something a little lighter.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.200]   The fire arrives this week.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.080]   In fact, I'm excited because Tuesday we get the lighter,
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.960]   and then you said fire.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.480]   Fire.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.960]   I was like, I was like, Kindle fire.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.440]   Kindle fire.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.080]   Should I say Kindle fire every time?
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.920]   I don't know.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.400]   Well, for a while, sure.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.800]   I can't just say the fire.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:45.960]   No.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.920]   I have a fire.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.960]   No, because it's--
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.520]   Why are you--
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.320]   I have fire.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.280]   What if you need to yell at the crowded theater?
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.120]   You're right.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.080]   OK, that's a good point.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.400]   If we're in a launch pad as we are,
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.360]   we should always say--
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.280]   Kindle fire.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.560]   Kindle fire.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.800]   I think I violated my First Amendment rights.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.160]   Are you going to order the Kindle fire, Patrick?
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.040]   No.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.880]   You're not interested.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.680]   Do you have an iPad?
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.440]   I have an iPad.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.240]   You prefer that?
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.320]   I have software investments, and I'm going to do what I usually do.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.120]   I'm going to let Veronica suffer through the beta.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.680]   I'm going to let you suffer through the beta.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   Will it Tom suffer through the beta?
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.960]   We're going to see whether or not Amazon actually sells
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.680]   the extra million Kindle fires.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.840]   I'm going to admire Amazon's tablet platform,
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.160]   splitting three ways from Sunday between Barnes and Noble,
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.200]   Amazon, and--
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.080]   Oh, yes, the seven--
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.680]   --and another platform.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.000]   The end to tablet comes out on Wednesday the day after.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.400]   Yeah, it's 250 bucks.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.320]   The Kindle fire, 200 bucks.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.360]   I think the pricing's great.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.600]   I think this is going to do huge things for Android tablets
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.560]   in terms of actually getting into the market-- getting
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.120]   on the board, as they say, because at this point,
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.920]   the market has basically looked at Android,
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.560]   and been like, yeah, we sold 100,000.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.040]   Amazon has made more than five million units for this year.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.600]   Hey, I once made more than 5,000 cupcakes.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.080]   And you know what?
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.760]   Does it mean only four of them?
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.280]   We're eating.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.560]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.680]   I can make five million do you think Amazon is that?
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.240]   I could sell them.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.880]   Johnny, do you think they're misguided, making five million
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.920]   of them?
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.160]   They study this stuff to death.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.640]   I think they know what they're doing, don't they?
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.240]   They probably sell 4 million plus.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.040]   4.8--
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.540]   7.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.360]   They make a bet.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.600]   I could lose another bet.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.560]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.160]   They up to their order, too.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.560]   They had ordered 3 and 1/2 million or something.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.060]   Right.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.000]   They went back and said, regardless,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.920]   pre-orders are such a rate, we need to--
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.840]   That's probably what they're basically--
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.920]   Well, do we know how many Amazon Kindle users there are currently?
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.720]   No.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.600]   They never say--
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.680]   Do we know how many Amazon--
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.720]   Because I know Amazon has like 42 billion registered clients
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.520]   or active clients.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.020]   OK.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.560]   Everybody, can you turn out the lights?
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.760]   Robert Scoble just walked by.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.320]   Don't say anything.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.200]   So on the--
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.700]   Shh.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.200]   So many.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:44.720]   I'm not kidding.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   Sorry.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.320]   On the issue of the Kindle Fire.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:48.820]   OK.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.320]   Shh.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:49.820]   Shh.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.320]   Shh.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.800]   Just pretend he's naughty.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.600]   Everybody check out on 4 Square.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.280]   Nobody's here.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.600]   Go away.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.100]   OK.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.000]   He just walks back into the kitchen.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   No, that's where it's the first place he always hits.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.240]   So he's actually more irritated by Google+ brands than I am,
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.640]   as per se.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.120]   So which is irritating.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.400]   And we're going to get to that in a second,
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.520]   because I'm irritated, too.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.560]   I'm mad as hell.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.800]   But here's what I want to ask you guys,
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.480]   is are we victims of living in a bit of a tech bubble,
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.400]   in that we are fundamentally a different class of people--
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.600]   That's a given.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.800]   Well, yes.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   But I mean, specifically--
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.200]   And so is every single person listening to this show.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.960]   Yes, exactly.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.320]   We are all the type of people for whom $500 and up for a tablet
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.200]   is not outrageous.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.700]   Right.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.800]   The people that it's going to--
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.300]   Really?
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.280]   You don't have an iPad?
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.600]   I'm going to pay you better.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.480]   Well, I'll tell you where this is going to--
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.240]   Yeah, you do.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.400]   You heard him?
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.080]   Where this is going to be huge is my parents-in-law
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.840]   are the type they already bought the first nook.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.320]   Like, they don't buy any of this stuff.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.400]   But the nook was cheap enough.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.120]   They bought it.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.640]   They would never consider paying more than $200, $300
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.720]   for a tablet reader of any variety.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.360]   And now this is a whole new opening of a category
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.400]   to a type of people who would never buy an iPad.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.080]   It would never occur to them to buy an iPad.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.840]   And I do think it would--
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.520]   So seeing it as a reader, seeing it as a current one--
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.280]   Oh, it's akin to like it that.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:06.960]   It's a reader.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.840]   It's a reader.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.760]   I could buy that.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.400]   I think it'll be interesting to watch the reactions.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.440]   Personally, I agree with you.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.720]   Amazon knows its market.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.960]   Amazon's got a huge customer base.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.880]   They've got an ecosystem.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.960]   They've got everything going there to make this a success.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.320]   I think it'll be interesting to watch,
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.480]   because what makes the Kindle so wonderful,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.560]   what makes a Sony reader so wonderful,
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.000]   and a couple other plowards out there,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.560]   is e-ink battery life, simplicity, and focus.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.160]   And now--
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.480]   None of which the fire has.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.760]   None of which any tablet has.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.760]   Right.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.520]   You know, I think it's going to be really interesting to watch.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.640]   I think it's also going to be really interesting to watch,
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.880]   as Android is forking.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.400]   This is like watching angry Linux developers
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.760]   move in seven different directions.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.480]   And I think it's going to be really interesting to watch
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.560]   how people react, or if people even care.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.760]   I think most of the Amazon users would be like,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.800]   hey, I'm on Amazon.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.760]   I've got Amazon stuff.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.960]   I don't think anybody necessarily knows its Android.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.760]   They never, in the announcement, mentioned Google or--
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.800]   And I'm not sure, but I would assume
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.920]   that they're going to try to minimize using the word tablet.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.600]   They don't want people to think of this as being
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.080]   in the same category as the iPad.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.600]   So, did BNN make a mistake calling it a tablet?
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.760]   I don't know if it's a mistake, but as long as they
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.200]   focus on the reading and media consumption aspects,
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.440]   then they're able to position us.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.680]   Well, I'll tell you, and Tom was saying,
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.040]   the best thing that the NUC is doing with Fards and Noble
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.600]   is implying all the things that--
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.080]   Oh, they've won over.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.040]   Yes, this is great.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.440]   They came out in their press release,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   in their press announcement, and said, the NUC tablet
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.600]   has Netflix.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.640]   The NUC tablet has Hulu.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.440]   The NUC tablet has all these video
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.760]   that you don't get in other arenas.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.200]   They didn't--
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.520]   What, and they specifically said--
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.400]   Amazon didn't have it.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.720]   Amazon has Netflix, and they announced Netflix
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.640]   at their Kindle announcement.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.920]   They got angry birds, check this.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.880]   They said, and then the NUC has Netflix hanging
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.600]   in the Kindle dozen.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.400]   Kindle's an Amazon.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.720]   They got everybody thinking, well,
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.280]   because Amazon has an ecosystem, of course,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.840]   the Kindle Fire is just going to be Amazon.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.520]   And so, Barnes and Noble's the one
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.160]   if you want to get other things like Netflix
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.320]   to the point that Amazon had to come out with a press release
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.960]   the next day and say, hey, we've said from the very beginning,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.600]   we have Netflix.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.000]   That's clever, but how long does that fool people?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.960]   Come on.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.680]   I mean, it doesn't matter, because the important thing
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.640]   to note is that both of the companies are focusing
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.440]   on the media consumption aspect.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.160]   They're not focusing--
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.920]   And by the way--
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.160]   magazines.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:11.640]   Yes.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.880]   I think magazines may be kind of the unheralded real strength
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.080]   of those--
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.920]   The entire metaphor of the Kindle Fire is a new fact.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.440]   It's a rack.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.600]   It's all a rack, and that fits right into it.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.120]   And they have got big time.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.640]   They've got the Hearst and Condi Nast people involved.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.400]   They're going to have GQ.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.040]   They're going to have--
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.520]   I'm sorry, Vanity Fair without having
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.200]   five pounds of paper in my hands.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.720]   Awesome.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.080]   It's not Vanity Fair.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.880]   And imagine Vanity Fair with--
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.360]   But imagine Vanity Fair with audio and video.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.160]   You know, imagine--
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.400]   Smellivish and bad enough to--
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.320]   And the way it is.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.400]   Imagine Nicole Kidman's--
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.120]   Smellivish.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.160]   --comes out of the page and kisses you.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.360]   It will be awesome.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.800]   You know, I have a good imagination.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.320]   Yes.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.160]   Just because of that damn thing you're wearing.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:59.400]   No, I think that may be kind of the hidden gem
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.280]   in the Kindle Fire that a lot of people who read magazines--
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.320]   I know a lot of people, especially women,
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.880]   who read a lot of magazines.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.560]   This may be the ultimate magazine platform, especially
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.720]   if these companies-- and I think they do--
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.280]   they see this more than Apple.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.320]   I think people are starting to get
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.600]   nervous about Apple.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.040]   Apple takes 30%.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.440]   Apple owns you subscribers.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.560]   All these issues.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.960]   I think a lot of people--
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.560]   Those are magazines.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.760]   Here comes the counter-arguments.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.000]   Those are actual physical magazines.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.920]   These come magazines.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.440]   People like Norton are going to say--
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.680]   Norton, initially you're going to be skeptical,
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.560]   because you like the paper.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.320]   But I think that ultimately this may be--
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.200]   because magazine publishers realize they don't want that,
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.880]   that costs them a lot of money to print.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.080]   They are going to love this, and they're going to really
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.160]   push this medium forward.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.560]   And most people aren't as strong as Patrick
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.960]   and can't carry all those magazines around.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.880]   On one hand, you guys are making really good arguments.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.080]   On the other hand, it is--
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.200]   On the other hand--
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.280]   No, that's John's job.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.200]   No, I think it's--
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   I could do that.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.600]   Well, one, it's frustrating, because most magazine publishers
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.440]   do not have a good digital platform.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.120]   I agree.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.360]   Most of them are struggling.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.360]   It's like--
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.120]   It's going to take Amazon, I think, helping them a lot.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.760]   And they don't like the numbers.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.960]   They don't like the numbers?
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.400]   Well, the ad numbers, the ad revenue numbers
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.680]   suck for digital companies.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.960]   Even if you can get rid of the glossy paper
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.360]   and the ink and all of that stuff.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.880]   They can't seem to get the numbers up.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.920]   That's interesting.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.360]   The ad numbers are going to be bad until the commercial--
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.480]   No, it's not just the ad numbers.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.680]   They can't get the subscriber numbers up.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.360]   But wait a minute.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.040]   Haven't we seen numbers things like the Why--
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.600]   when Mired Magazine offered iPad version 100,000 people got it?
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.120]   But again, that's our bubble group.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   So that doesn't work.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.840]   First of all, I'm inside the bubble group,
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.360]   and they keep sending me reminders.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.840]   Like, hey, by the way, why are subscription numbers?
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.000]   No, you have the iPad version.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.520]   I'm like, yeah, that sounds awesome.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.360]   I'll definitely get around to checking that out.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.200]   But it's checking an egg.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   So if Amazon can sell 5 million fires this year--
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.000]   concert Kindle fires this year.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.720]   Which I honestly think people are looking at it as tablets.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.680]   Whether Amazon says it or not, people are like,
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.720]   how many of these are the press releases right now
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.000]   trying to find evidence of his assertion.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.560]   And I have not seen that.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.040]   They have not seen that.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.160]   They have not seen tablet anywhere.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.120]   And yeah, people see it as that.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.280]   And yet, they say $200 cheaper.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.800]   That's the strength of it is it's a $200 tablet.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.720]   Right.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.080]   What kind of people bought the $99 touchpad?
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.440]   Right, they got the $99.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.880]   And that's the magic moment.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.040]   People will tune out-- there are a category of people
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.360]   who will tune out everything until it crosses that magic $99
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.040]   prize point.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.280]   By the way, Scoble found us, I'm sorry.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:20.840]   We tried.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.360]   Where is he?
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.720]   Did you see we turned out the lights?
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.120]   We had everybody be very quiet and you still found your way in.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.000]   I'll tell you something.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.720]   The good is not a jelly.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.520]   No, he was at the Napa Film Festival, weren't you?
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.880]   Did you bring Adrian Grineer with you?
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.440]   No, we'd try and get some wine that we wrote down.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.160]   Oh, wine'll be good.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.160]   Wine'll be good.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.120]   Wine, bring it up here.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.680]   Well, that'll do.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.720]   John says, bring up the wine.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.280]   It didn't take long.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.720]   Who had the over-under at 20 minutes?
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.760]   I think that there's a lot of potential.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.640]   You sell 5 million units of this.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.800]   Condi Nast puts Vanity Fair on this thing.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.360]   How many subscriptions do they have to do?
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.400]   100,000 to make this worthwhile?
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   200,000?
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.160]   John, you know the economics.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.600]   A million, really?
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.920]   I was thinking the one possibility exists in the hat.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.280]   We haven't seen it executed yet as we say.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.560]   Look, we'll give you a five-year subscription to Vanity Fair
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.840]   and the tablet for free.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.480]   And you get the subscription on the tablet.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.880]   First, twig around with that.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.080]   They did.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.240]   They were going to make their own.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.320]   They decided the--
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.720]   Well, they also backed off because they
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.960]   didn't have the right technology.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.440]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.840]   That thing, they had some big reader that
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.600]   was a bit clunker.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.680]   You could roll it up or something.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.280]   It was crazy.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.680]   But all the publishers that have looked at that
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.080]   have all backed off and said, yeah,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.240]   it's better to just let these other guys make the tablets.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.640]   And then we'll try to work in there.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.040]   But nobody wants to work with Apple
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.200]   because they don't want to give up the 30% of the revenue.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.400]   What's the choice for a magazine publisher, though, John?
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   Is there a future for Vanity Fair?
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.480]   Vanity Fair is advertising these are up.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.240]   And so their search's good.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.880]   Vanity Fair is one of the most successful publications
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.320]   you can find.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.440]   And it's Vogue.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.680]   It's Vogue is still killing.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.400]   But it's--
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   OK.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.600]   It's stuff like the special--
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   You think you know why we need Veronica?
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.960]   You don't like magazines.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.160]   You hate them to the point where you refuse to see them.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.960]   Well, I'll use as an example two magazines that perhaps
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.480]   aren't in the same category as Vanity Fair and Vogue,
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.840]   the Economist and the New Yorker.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.800]   You hate those magazines.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.680]   I love them.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.640]   But I love the content.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.120]   I don't love the fact that they're piling up on my bedside table.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.040]   So you can't throw them out.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:08.840]   You can't grab them.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.320]   Go to the garbage can.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.560]   No, you don't want them to recycling them.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.040]   You know why?
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.960]   Because I haven't read them.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.400]   Or there's--
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   There's a big article in there.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.720]   But you have, as a subscriber to the Economist, access
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.360]   to the iPad.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:17.920]   I know.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.040]   So you just toss them.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.680]   You can read the articles.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.200]   I did well.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.120]   And in fact, I don't even want the paper anymore
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.000]   because I have them on my iPad.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.880]   Yeah, I get the Economist.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.280]   And I like having the paper because I like just having it
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.440]   sitting there on the dining room table where I can just
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.360]   don't have to get the iPad.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.120]   But I can also go back and read articles in the past.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.960]   So this is, to me, the strength of the tablet platform.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.560]   And I think one of the reasons is a magazine publisher.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.080]   I think that they would embrace this.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.960]   But maybe if the economics aren't--
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.200]   I don't think economics are good.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.800]   The other thing is that, for example, you'll go on your
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.800]   Economist and you'll look up the articles.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.400]   And you won't be able to-- you won't
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.400]   fling page through it and see all these ads.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:51.920]   I won't see the ads.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.440]   You're right.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.840]   So there's a lot of ads you're not going to see.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.360]   It's a tough sale for advertisers.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.600]   It's a completely different advertising mission for a lot
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.800]   of special interest magazines.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   You don't have to tell me--
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.320]   Well, you're talking about a drumming magazine, a guitar
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.000]   magazine, hot rod magazine.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.600]   It is enormously difficult to go into a vendor and say, hey,
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.760]   we're going to give you a banner ad?
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.280]   They're like, OK, I know what the click through it.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.520]   And a banner ad says.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.160]   And it's--
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:12.680]   And it's--
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.920]   Well, and I think that's all just accepted
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.840]   about the emerging space.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.920]   Because on the surface, by all measures--
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.600]   and we talk about this on frame rate a lot--
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.000]   digital advertising is--
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.480]   ad for ad much, much more valuable because you can track.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.080]   Who watches it?
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.040]   How long they look at it?
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.240]   Whether or not they look through--
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.880]   If you actually have the tools to do that.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.320]   And those have to be embedded into the platform.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.800]   And they have to be something that the person paying
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.760]   for the advertising believes in.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.080]   Apps and deals and ratings, consensual hallucination,
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.640]   industry standard for television.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.120]   It is the biggest pile I have seen in my adult life.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.520]   That was an amazing--
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   Selfie bleeped himself.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.400]   It sounded like I leaned into the world.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.880]   Sorry, I didn't mean to--
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.360]   No, no, no, no.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.280]   But it is--
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.200]   It has to be doing that for decades.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   We've never had an ad ever.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.880]   It was always self-ended.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.640]   But it's enormously difficult for a profitable platform
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.720]   like television to make a transition.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.040]   And you've heard it over and over again in the last five years.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.560]   We're trading analog dollars for digital sense.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.960]   And if you're in a beleaguered platform like most magazines,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.120]   Vanity Fair is an exception.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.320]   Cosmopolitan is an exception.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.920]   A lot of the big, thick books are an exception.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.520]   If you're talking about smaller magazines,
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.160]   it is an enormous bridge to golf.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.800]   You have to figure out how to carry your existing consumer
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.680]   base, which in many cases is fairly old,
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.280]   into a new platform, onto a new distribution,
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.920]   and it requires even a tourist--
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.720]   But don't you have to do that?
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.040]   I don't know what I have to do.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.680]   You can also go out of business.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.840]   That's your answer.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.800]   You're going to say all magazines are going to go out
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.280]   of business, though.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.480]   No, no, no, no.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.240]   Mediums have never been destroyed.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.800]   They linger in some news for it.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.840]   Exactly that.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.320]   Which is we're going to have a small number of magazines
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.080]   succeed.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.840]   We're going to have a small number of printed books
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.600]   still in the future.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.440]   We're probably going to still have a small number
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.080]   of optical disc formats for music and video games.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.960]   Still in the future.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.160]   That's the one that really follows me out.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.000]   This is how we do.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.080]   They're all going to be reduced to collectible formats,
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.640]   or specialty formats, the way vinyl records are still made
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.400]   today.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.160]   The majority is going to be digital.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.080]   And it's all a matter of--
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.360]   I think hard copies did.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.280]   I think hard-- I agree with you, John, in the past TV
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.560]   didn't replace radio, radio didn't replace news,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.600]   but I think this is different.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.000]   I think physical media is dead.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.120]   Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.000]   Vinyl still exists.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.080]   One note is good enough.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.040]   It's pure.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:25.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.320]   I had to triple negative in order to go all the way back around.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.760]   What about cylinders?
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.080]   Well, OK.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   But the vinyls--
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.560]   8 tracks.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:32.920]   8 tracks.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.480]   We've changed them.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.720]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   8 tracks.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.560]   You think magazines are 8 tracks?
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.960]   Put them into different categories.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.160]   8 tracks was replaced with the convenience of cassette.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.320]   And we've talked about it for the next convenience.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.320]   You make it least argument.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   You make it least argument.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.760]   And likewise, in analog formats,
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.480]   cylinders were replaced with 33 and a third LPs.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.280]   That's where they were replaced with 78s, but--
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.520]   OK, whatever.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.480]   Down the road, right?
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.080]   16s didn't make it.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.720]   Which still exists to this date.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.040]   And likewise, film itself is not going to go away,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.280]   even though the digital is easier to distribute.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.680]   It's easier to produce in.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.200]   Film, there will be a place for--
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.280]   But it's a hobby.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.520]   You're laying right into your arguments.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.040]   And your arguments stinks.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.320]   What's the event horizon?
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.680]   Are we talking 10 years, 25 years, 50 years?
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.880]   And like, 10 years, there's going
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.000]   to be like two freaks running around with 60-millimeter
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.280]   ear flex cameras, because they have to have film.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.040]   It's not right if it's not film.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.400]   Why haven't we gotten rid of LPs, then?
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.160]   Why haven't we gotten rid of black and white film?
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.560]   People still shoot on black and white film.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.080]   Why?
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.600]   It's for art.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.280]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.880]   All right, I grant you--
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.160]   in 10 years, if you go and you stay at the plaza,
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.960]   the butler will iron a newspaper for you
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.880]   and give it to you perfectly pressed, and you can read it.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.960]   Print it on elephant dumb paper.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.480]   However--
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.200]   Exactly.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.320]   But that is going to be a very small--
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:47.880]   So what you are--
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.680]   Yeah, where is 90% of the sales going to be?
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.000]   Like, I will weep when they stop pressing CDs,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.760]   because I'm going to have to deal with probably some--
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.440]   For sure, we're going to do that.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.240]   And there's never years.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.160]   We never loved--
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.240]   Doesn't mean we can't fight it.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:58.800]   --because we can't fight it.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.760]   We're into the way.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.480]   I think the broader point here is that there is a certain amount
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.920]   of attention out there for entertaining things,
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.280]   and there's a certain amount of money to advertise to those.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.240]   And it's all about figuring out how we bring those two
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.120]   together in the future in digital.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.480]   What we're doing right now is this long process of,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.840]   well, I don't want to spend my money there.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.600]   I want to spend it there.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.840]   But the people aren't there anymore.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.400]   They're over here, and they're doing video games.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.120]   And I want everything to stay the same.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.000]   And it's not.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.760]   People are doing all kinds of different things,
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.240]   and it's not porting over very nicely.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.360]   People aren't saying, well, I used to read magazines,
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.760]   so now I read magazines on my laptop and my tablet.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.260]   Right.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.480]   You're doing all kinds of different things.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.240]   And that's the mistake.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.720]   You really want to go into the next medium.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.160]   I just--
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.360]   I got an argument.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.040]   OK, I'll jump on.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.880]   Let's hear you decide.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.760]   Hey, I like it all.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   I'm saying--
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.000]   First of all, we talk about cylinders and LPs
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:46.720]   and the rest of it.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.960]   These are immature mediums that are actually, essentially,
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.760]   the same thing.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.200]   I mean, the cylinder was a bunch of--
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.960]   Different form factors.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.960]   A bunch of grooves.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.040]   And then the CD, evens a bunch of holes.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:56.680]   How crunchy about it.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680]   OK.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.880]   Magazines have been around for so long,
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.640]   it's a mature medium that cannot disappear just
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.200]   based on media theory.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.360]   It's just not going to happen.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.480]   And that's the only argument you need,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.720]   which is that it's been around.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.520]   It's very handy.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.520]   It's a portable medium.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.560]   I always like to take the point, like, let's switch time
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.200]   around.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.680]   And everyone's reading magazines on their little tablets.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.360]   And then somebody comes out with this revolutionary idea
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.800]   and says, hey, first, cover the paper.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.560]   And they're printing on it.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.360]   And you can take these things and you can create it.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.280]   And then you can-- wow, this is so cool.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.320]   Look, I can-- some throw it out.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.480]   And then I can throw it out.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.400]   And I don't care.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.240]   I'm limited battery life.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.000]   I just realized what a first world conversation this is also.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.680]   All right.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.520]   We're going to take a break.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.120]   Come back with more.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.480]   We'll hold all technology conversations.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.600]   One more question.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.560]   Harry McCracken on the technology
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.120]   says Amazon's going to turn into a phone.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.560]   What?
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.640]   Kindle Firephone.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.480]   Kindle Firephone.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.960]   Can you buy running a VoIP app?
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.000]   Kindle Firephone.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.160]   What do you think?
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.160]   It's a muscle.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:51.760]   Crazy.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.000]   You're crazy, Harry.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.960]   Does it have a good mic?
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.600]   I mean, eventually, yes.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.000]   I'm going to say eventually Amazon's
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.560]   going to get into everything.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.680]   He says Amazon's already done a lot of the heavy lifting
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.800]   required to build a phone.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.280]   It could repurpose some of the effort.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.600]   It's poured into the Kindle Fire tablet.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:06.760]   No, but--
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.280]   Well, sure.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.160]   I can send Amazon--
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.040]   Maybe they don't turn-- maybe they do a phone.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.680]   He's saying, I'm not saying a Kindle Firephone would
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.840]   be an antidote to Android fragmentation.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.640]   Actually, if it's like the Kindle Fire tablet,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.560]   it would be one of the most fragmented Android phones of all.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.680]   But the Kindle Fire with its simply interface, deeply
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.960]   integrated services, is fragmentation with a point.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.240]   In other words, he's saying, this could be the best Android
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:27.960]   phone ever.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.320]   It's fragmentation with love.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.240]   It's almost meaningless to call it an Android phone.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.000]   I mean, it's got Android--
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.480]   It would be an Amazon phone.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.520]   And that's the point.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.880]   They could buy WebOS tomorrow.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.880]   I'm not saying they would.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.440]   They could buy WebOS and run the same interface
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.120]   on the top of WebOS on the Kindle Fire.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.920]   Nobody would know the difference.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.200]   You know who is selling the Razer, the Motorola Razer,
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.840]   on 11, 11, 11 for $111 Amazon Wireless.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.320]   I have bought my last three phones from Amazon Wireless.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.480]   They are a very big player already in wireless.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.840]   It's an interesting point.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.560]   The phone I could see being kind of a backdoor discovery
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.880]   in that you buy this ultra portable reader that just
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.560]   happens to have the form factor that we associate with the phone.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.000]   And they're like, well, this is silly.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.200]   Why can I not take calls on this?
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.120]   And then at some point, they just--
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.000]   How about Corey's got a great idea in our chat room.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.120]   How about they buy Sprint?
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.200]   They give away free phone service because they're
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.960]   making enough money on the front end Amazon services.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.720]   Part of Amazon Prime.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.240]   And Sprint makes its money off the wholesale service of LTE
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:23.600]   anyway.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.040]   Anyway, if that Sprint makes more money on wholesaling on MVNO
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.400]   than they do on being Sprint.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.480]   They don't want to be Sprint anymore.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.440]   They want to sell you.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.840]   So maybe they don't even buy Sprint.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.120]   They just become an MVNO.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:35.960]   Mm.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.680]   My love are also pointed out that you need paper magazines
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.800]   for doctors' offices.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.120]   Yeah, that must be six months.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.200]   That's the only way they can transmit diseases.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:44.700]   That's right.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.280]   And keep the doctors in business.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.440]   Otherwise, it would all be healthy.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.080]   Did you see a JFK?
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:48.680]   Is it JFK?
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.320]   They have a restaurant that have all iPad for the--
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.960]   instead of where they would put the jukebox.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.680]   They have the iPad there with the menu and everything.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.800]   For five iPads at a doctor's office.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.960]   My doctor's office won't let you have any electronics on
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.480]   in the waiting room.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.200]   What?
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.640]   What kind of doctor is this?
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.880]   They're fragile-ketch viruses.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.680]   Why?
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.200]   Why?
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:06.960]   This is the end thing.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.000]   Did you ask him?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   It's Murray County.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.800]   You know, I see this more and more, and I hate it.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.040]   Turn off cell phones.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.280]   It's crazy.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.640]   What's wrong with a cell phone?
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.240]   She said interference with the machine.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.440]   Oh, bull crap.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.120]   What do you, a pilot?
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.080]   Even the pilot doesn't-- anyway, what do I have to do?
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   Do I have to do an ad here?
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.640]   Yes, please.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.720]   What is the ad for?
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   How do I go to my PC?
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.920]   How about go to my PC?
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.200]   I don't even know what's going on.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   I didn't even start the timer.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.520]   You know, where's the remote control?
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.160]   Let's start the timer.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.440]   You're running just about it.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.000]   So you're running timers now?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.320]   Yes, I'm trying to keep this thing up.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.400]   I always try to get out of here.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.040]   And I say, what is done already?
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:41.560]   I'm trying to--
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.160]   I used to go 15 minutes on some of these ads.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.400]   I'm trying to-- not on the ad.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.320]   I'm trying to attend the show.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.720]   I want to shorten you.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.400]   Anyway, what does it go to my PC?
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.320]   I don't come back for that.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.520]   I know.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.240]   Go to my PC.com, right?
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.000]   That's the place to go for remote access
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.480]   that John's going to walk through.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:58.760]   Go ahead.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.960]   Just walk-- go ahead.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   Have another piece of try-tip.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.760]   It's fabulous.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.320]   Hey, John, can you grab me a diagnosis?
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.280]   There you go.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.200]   Thank you, sir.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.640]   No, thanks.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.600]   Anyway, thanks to go to my PC for their support.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.360]   Back to the show.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.400]   No, I wouldn't do that.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:13.960]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.040]   Do you know what I've used Go to my PC for recently?
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.800]   What?
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.080]   On the road, I'm at a hotel.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.040]   And they got terrible Wi-Fi.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.480]   I don't know what it is about hotels where universally,
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   they all have absolutely terrible Wi-Fi, right?
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.200]   But I know at home, I've got good bandwidth.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.120]   And let's say there's something, a preview I need to check,
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.560]   or a file that needs to be downloaded and checked.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.480]   What I'll do is I'll go to my PC to my office PC,
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.760]   download the file remotely, if I can download the 200 megabytes
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.360]   or whatever.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.040]   And I'll actually watch the preview over Go to my PC.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.560]   Yeah, for the choked bandwidth.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.360]   Isn't that brilliant?
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:42.920]   Yes, it is.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.320]   It's basically like a VPN.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.080]   So one more use of Go to my PC.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.440]   It allows you secure, safe, surfing anywhere you go,
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.800]   because you're 128-bit SSL back to your office.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.480]   And if your office has high-speed internet,
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.760]   you can use its high-speed internet
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.160]   to get those big files.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:57.720]   Brilliant.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.920]   That's a great use.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.400]   Mac or PC, I want you to try it free right now.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.600]   Visit GoToMyPC.com.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.080]   Click the orange, try it free button.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.120]   Use the offer code, Twit.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.520]   It works everywhere.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.840]   It works on Macs and PCs.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.240]   And with the free iPad app, you can also
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.960]   access your office computer from an iPad.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.000]   It's a little wacky running windows on an iPad.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   How do you deal with the right clicks?
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.320]   They have the whole thing set up.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.560]   They get a little mouse thing.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.400]   It's really sweet.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.440]   They've solved the whole thing.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.440]   You get full keyboard functionality.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.400]   You use touch.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.360]   You use gesture.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.800]   You still have access to that.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   But you're using Windows.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.760]   It's really, really sound amazing.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.560]   I'm actually using this to freak someone out
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.440]   and tell them I ported Windows.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:35.920]   I know.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.420]   I see.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.280]   It's very impressive.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   I've got to run it on my iPad.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.000]   It's very impressive.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I'm going to go to my PC.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.360]   That's awesome.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.200]   It is magic.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.280]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.440]   Click the try it free button.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.440]   Use the offer code, Twit.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.240]   Try it free for a couple of weeks.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.720]   Actually, I guess you get a month free.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.320]   And you will be amazed.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.680]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.600]   One more thing on that.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   Go to my PC.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.360]   We're going to do it again.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.640]   We did it with a Twit photo.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.040]   I think we did it once with Twit.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.000]   We're going to do it again.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.440]   We're giving away an iPad too.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.920]   We know the holidays are coming.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.440]   And we want some lucky member of our audience
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.880]   to use an iPad too to access their office computer
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.440]   while they're away from the holidays.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.920]   We're calling it the way for the holidays giveaway
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.000]   from go to my PC.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.840]   To enter to win, here's what you do.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.240]   You can do it right now or anytime
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.680]   between now and November 23.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.040]   So we're going to give you 10 days to do this.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:30.120]   Send a tweet with a hashtag #PoundTwitFreeIPad.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.040]   In your tweet, tell us your holiday travel destination,
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.000]   where you might want to work remotely if you're not
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.280]   going anywhere with your iPad 2 and go to my PC.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.320]   And I got to really sell it, even though we're
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.480]   going to pick it randomly.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.000]   So again, tweet where you're going for the holidays,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.800]   where you'd like to take your iPad,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.080]   and make sure you use the hashtag #TwitFreeIPad.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.880]   You have to send that tweet by November 23.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.840]   And you'll be entered to win a new iPad 2 from go to my PC.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.240]   It'll be a random drawing, but do be creative.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.200]   Well, now's the winner and review some of your tweets
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.360]   in the show the week after next.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.120]   So that's a good reason to be creative.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   Do something creative we'll put you on the show.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.360]   Other rules available in the show notes for this episode
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   are at player.pottrack.com/rules-twit.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.360]   Thank you.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.160]   Go to my PC.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.720]   We love giving away iPads.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.360]   I hope you're the winner.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.200]   So Patrick, you, like Mr. Scoble here,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.120]   are unhappy with the brands on Google+.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.720]   Google+, we're going to do brands.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.600]   We're going to save it.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.440]   We're going to have features for businesses.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.320]   We're going to launch it.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.120]   It launches.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.560]   Surprise it.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.800]   It permanently attaches itself to whatever account
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.520]   you have open.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.960]   That's what happened to Robert.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.080]   Wait, wait, what else happens?
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.280]   There's no official verification policy.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.480]   You can have multiple accounts for the same thing.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.680]   Anybody can be Twitter.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.480]   Anybody can be Twitter.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.560]   Anybody can be Texasilla.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.000]   There's verified-- if you're a huge company,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   you might have verified site.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.840]   But there's no way to figure out how to verify it.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.400]   There is no system for tracking who's posting.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.040]   There is no system for logging in multiple people,
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.680]   unless you give a bunch of people the same email address.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.840]   It is a steaming mess.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.320]   Yes!
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.680]   Robert Scobel, he agrees.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.840]   First of all, full disclosure, I haven't tried it yet.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.360]   What?
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.240]   But all the complaints that you're in the bubble,
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.000]   all the complaints I've heard, have been stuff
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.720]   that I would assume would happen when you take baby steps.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.960]   The whole thing, like, no way to verify and no way to track
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   by that same logic that you should have been annoyed
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.000]   by the calamitous--
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   No, why the delete expol--
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.760]   did they wait 14 months to launch it if they weren't actually
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.600]   going to do anything useful for administrating
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.000]   a brand in a company?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.080]   Baby steps, bro.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.360]   That's somebody-- like, like--
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.200]   No!
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.000]   But this isn't a baby step.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.320]   This is a mess.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.000]   So you would prefer that they just don't even have anything.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   You don't even--
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.520]   It's all perfect.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.400]   Well, we're using it.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.280]   And by the way--
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.800]   You're just defending it out of the house.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.360]   All right, where's the chat room?
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.680]   Who's watching live?
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.640]   I want you to open up a Brian Brushwood Google+ page.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.160]   Let's see how many Brian Brushwood Google+ page
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   we can get open.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:57.960]   I hate you.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.000]   Don't do that to me.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.720]   Don't do that.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.000]   Sounds like a first world problem.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.480]   By the way--
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.920]   And Eileen, you pointed this out-- there was a duplicate
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.440]   Twitter page, and they killed it.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.240]   So they are--
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.520]   They are Google-killed it.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:10.720]   So--
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.080]   What I don't get is why they're not
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.640]   being more vicious about this when they were so vicious
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.920]   about the real names policy.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.420]   I know.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.720]   They could have been as strict with this company policy
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.600]   if they wanted to be.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.800]   And we are still not verified, although they did kill the--
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.040]   this is the other Twitter page.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.640]   They killed it, or somebody else killed it.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.800]   Ah, that's a good point.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.680]   It might not have been Google.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.120]   It might have been just the people who started it.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.520]   Because like, Veronica and I were going back for--
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.040]   I wanted somebody else to.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:32.960]   We can't walk in here.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.040]   Well, here's what Robert said in his blog post.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.680]   He works for Rackspace.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.440]   He immediately, as right-- and I think smartly so,
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.600]   Robert's-- went and created a Rackspace brand page,
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.640]   then realized that he owns it.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.920]   You can't delegate it.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.800]   You can't have anybody else at Rackspace post to it,
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.600]   because they'd have to have your Google Gmail credentials.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.280]   Oh, no.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   Have you resolved that, Robert?
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:53.880]   Not been able to.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.720]   Has not resolved.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.520]   Duck your head down.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.960]   Surprise!
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.400]   There's no doubt that they're going
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.120]   to add multiple administrators, and that they're
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.160]   going to make this fix.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:01.680]   I'm sure they will.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.160]   I'm sure they will.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.160]   And the question is, they blocked--
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.040]   It was the point of launching it now.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.480]   They blocked a lot of people.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.360]   They said, oh, apply if you want a brand.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.120]   How long has it been?
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.200]   It's been six months?
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.880]   This is the Steve Jobs argument.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.800]   Then by your logic, they just shouldn't do it
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.320]   until it was all ready to go.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.760]   Well, they launched Google+.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.920]   They could have fell back.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   I would rather see an emerging platform that at least--
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.640]   What about that, Robert?
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.160]   Some kind of functionality from the get-go.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.240]   Brian, I think the problem is that they don't have
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.080]   a really good identity system.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:29.840]   And that's where the--
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.340]   They do.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.920]   This Nimmer's War thing comes from,
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.360]   and that's where the brand thing comes from.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.080]   And this is where Facebook does have.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.800]   How come Facebook's works?
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.840]   Facebook's paying attention.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.680]   Facebook has products.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:41.880]   Because it's really no different.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.960]   In fact, in theory, Google would have a better
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.040]   authentication system.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.200]   They have managers either when they first came out
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:48.960]   with brand pages.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.600]   They've just had six years to get ahead.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:50.960]   Right.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.560]   They're ahead of it.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.520]   Yeah, anybody could open a Facebook page for anybody else
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.400]   back in the day.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:55.800]   That's true.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.440]   In fact, there are only over-faking Facebook.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.720]   You still can sign up other people for groups, right?
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.760]   I mean, what's the whole thing where somebody signed up
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.080]   Zuckerberg for Nambla?
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.240]   Is this any different than Google+,
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.480]   I mean, is Facebook got an advantage, really?
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.760]   Or are we just used to Facebook?
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.360]   Well, there's a giant pile of existing users.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.720]   740 million.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.080]   But I mean, in the implementation, in the way it works,
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.440]   is it working--
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.920]   So I'm kind of on this track.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.280]   What is the conversation?
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.320]   OK, yeah, so it sounds like--
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.600]   Google+ friends.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.080]   There's no--
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:22.960]   John's not on Google+ plus.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.440]   He doesn't know.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:23.960]   Or care.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.560]   I am.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.960]   I'm John C. Devorak on Google+.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.720]   Oh, I'm going to plus you.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.760]   I think there's no--
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   There's no debate.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.520]   There's no debate that Google+ does not
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.520]   where it needs to be as far as company pages.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.640]   But your point seems to be that they shouldn't have even
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.440]   taken this first step.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.680]   I don't understand why they couldn't have launched.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.200]   What they have now, they could have
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.360]   launched with the rest of Google+.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.280]   What was the point--
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:43.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.400]   It's a fair question.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.200]   Given how annoyed you are, why would they do it with launch--
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.560]   This is a brand's page.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.160]   They said for a long time--
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.000]   It says John needs to add you to a circle before you can add back.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.560]   How did you do that?
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.800]   One of those tricks that very few people know about it.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.600]   Including you.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.600]   Two bottles of wine.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.520]   Is this a brand's page?
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.000]   It shouldn't be.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   They said they didn't want brand pages
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.560]   because they wanted to take the time to do it right.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.560]   Hey, hey, wait a minute.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.440]   I'm a brand.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:10.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.560]   It's my fault.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.040]   You're the brand that--
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:12.800]   I'm the brand.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.560]   I have to switch back to Leo.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.240]   Actually, I did bring the--
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:16.880]   I did bring the--
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.520]   You as Twitch.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.120]   --to it as Leo.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.400]   I guarantee you're on there.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.760]   By the way, they lie.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.640]   The other Brian Brushwood pages are already
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.720]   coming out in the chat room.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.720]   Thank you very much.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.040]   I'm so sorry.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.440]   Patrick, you've done it to him.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.600]   Oh, you were already in my tech journalist circle, John,
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.200]   actually.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.640]   But you know what I didn't have is no agenda show.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.720]   Shall I add that?
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.400]   You might as well.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.360]   That's a brand page.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.760]   So I have a brand circle.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.360]   I was doing it, but go ahead.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   And that's the problem.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.440]   Well, no, it's not the problem because we're open source.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.240]   It could be anybody.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.560]   And you don't mind that.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.920]   No, we encourage it.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.400]   They really should have made it restricted.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.960]   If they're going to say, this is a field test.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.520]   We're trying it out.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.360]   We're working out the kinks.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.040]   They should have launched it.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.320]   I thought--
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.520]   And if that would have made me mad--
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.720]   When they first announced it, that it
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.400]   was going to be limited to certain brands
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.320]   while they got it right.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.520]   Then the URLs would be very nice, too,
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.720]   because the whole link can do it.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   Yeah, down the road.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.720]   That's not a big concern.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.840]   Well, but again, Google+ seems to be aiming towards getting
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.160]   away from focusing on the URL and instead focusing
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.440]   on the keywords that bring you to people's Google+ page.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.400]   So basically, it's another search experiment for math
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.720]   keeks and comp site programmers inside of Google,
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.560]   rather than focusing on product and human beings
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.720]   that you need to drive.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.680]   I don't think it's a black-a-white like that.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.400]   I think you've got to start somewhere,
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.320]   and it's going to be incomplete from the ground.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.320]   Round two.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.920]   Yeah, I just don't see this as being that much different
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.400]   than what you can do on Facebook.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:39.920]   No.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.600]   Well, I mean, they have to match.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.920]   They have to have parity with what they--
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.520]   But Google said they were going to do it right,
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.720]   and they waited six months.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.800]   And they launched it, and it said that.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.640]   WDM.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.560]   I mean, what have they done here that actually makes it useful
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.680]   for people managing brands?
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.800]   It is a freaking Google+ account that you can decide--
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.640]   What do they do?
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.480]   They made it possible.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.760]   People have been begging for this,
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.520]   and then they give it, and you're like, well, I don't like
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.680]   the way you did it very much.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.640]   But they didn't do a lot of stuff that makes it--
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   if you're a brand--
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.160]   That's fair enough.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.800]   OK, you're a brand of one, so it's easy for you.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.680]   School will accidentally branded himself as an entire company.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.080]   Well, that's true.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.240]   I accidentally branded myself as a large company.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.480]   School will accidentally branded himself as Google+,
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.320]   and they really do.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.120]   Well, he used to be Twitter.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.280]   Cam is the former--
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:25.800]   Cam is the former.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.960]   Speaking of Amazon, Amazon bought YAP.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.960]   Did you know about YAP?
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.200]   YAP was used, I think, by teenagers for texting primarily.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.920]   But it's a voice recognition service.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.000]   I think there's a scramble now to get these voice recognition
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.680]   companies as Android and iOS.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.240]   And now Kindle won--
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.840]   That wasn't a McCracken's theory.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.800]   Yeah, well, maybe.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.720]   Well, a phone?
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.200]   Or are they trying to do Siri?
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.800]   Siri, it's all about Siri.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.320]   I think--
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.520]   Which, of course, we all know as a front for the CIA,
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.080]   because that way we get everybody's voice print.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.520]   And we can identify whatever it is you're doing based on that.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.560]   Because there's a lot of--
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.760]   No, what's wrong with the CIA?
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.960]   You're duped into thinking it's the CIA.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.120]   That's what they want you to think.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.080]   It's obviously the secret world government--
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.440]   It's an A-M-A-C-A.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.960]   The C-A-S-A-A is a front, it's Celsius.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.000]   By the way, on Siri--
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.680]   So give up your voice prints, everybody.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.400]   Knock yourself a sec.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.480]   What do they care if they have my voice prints?
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.640]   Just in case.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.840]   I will say this is for Siri.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.040]   Where ever could they find my voice prints?
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.640]   You.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.160]   Well, you're in a special category.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.240]   So I have noticed on Siri while there still are outages,
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.440]   Siri is getting way good at apologizing for them.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.920]   Because the other day, in fact, I
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.040]   was trying to hook up with--
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:38.040]   Really?
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.640]   It apologizes down to you?
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.280]   I was driving along-- you say, what was he saying?
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.080]   What was he saying?
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.040]   "Trees and Johnny's."
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.880]   And so I'm like, directions to--
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.320]   "Trees and Johnny's" and "Sam Raffell."
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.160]   And there's this pause, and then Siri goes, Brian, I am so sorry.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.760]   But I can't take this request right now.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.880]   Can you try later?
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.720]   You're kidding.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.480]   I'm going to do something bizarrely earnest about it
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.320]   that may be like, oh, Siri, I'm sorry.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.080]   I should have bothered.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.840]   Let me ask John.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.720]   John will take care of it for me.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.400]   So they are actually on the fly updating these responses.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:05.920]   I'm sure.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.800]   I'm sure it's continuously evolving.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.480]   In fact, you're seeing this first massively written,
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.600]   artificially intelligent personality that's
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.360]   emerging over time.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.560]   It starts with humor.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.240]   I am sorry.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.200]   I'm on my period.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.360]   Is that you or Siri?
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:27.200]   I saw iOS 5.0.1 the update over the year, first over the year
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.440]   update for Apple.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.600]   You know, Apple gets such a free pass from everybody.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.720]   Every phone in the world has had free over the year updates.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.760]   Going back to the original razer, and Apple now
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.120]   has over the year updates.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.720]   Whoopee!
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.440]   Anyway, they have a--
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.560]   I'll tell you what, I am happy.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.160]   Well, I don't have to hear all the details.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.480]   Connect it to that stupid iTunes anymore.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.680]   But unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it fixed the battery
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.040]   problem.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.560]   A lot of people complaining for me.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.040]   Not for me.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:53.680]   Did it fix it?
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.600]   No, not at all.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.360]   In fact, I've had a bizmo battery life.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.240]   And I'll be the first to admit it probably has something to do
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.440]   because I'm doing the Nike Plus GPS tracking when
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.920]   I go out on my bike rides and stuff.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.800]   So I haven't known how much of that has been a lifestyle
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.280]   thing.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.600]   But I know that even after the update, it's a bizmo.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.120]   I just carry that battery.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.080]   That's what he uses.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.640]   Like, God, yes!
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.320]   He's a five-pound battery.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.440]   I got this very weird way.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   There we go.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.440]   It's all handled.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.600]   Let me go ahead and get sucked in.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   He's dead.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.200]   The reason I care that everywhere is the sprit overdrive mode
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:21.720]   of that is--
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.240]   Got duct tape.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.160]   --randomly leaving my--
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.360]   So this is an energizer iPhone 4s.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.920]   Look at 18,000 milliamp batteries.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.280]   It's an all-around mix.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.920]   It's equivalent of 10 iPhone batteries in one.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.040]   No, you don't have to hang out.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:32.880]   Let's keep talking.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.320]   I've got plenty of time.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.320]   And, of course, it will last for two hours.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.080]   You know, with then-tenergate, they send everybody
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:40.600]   free cases.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.240]   Maybe this will be the solution of the battery issue.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.680]   Well, speaking of antennagate, let's talk about that.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.480]   Because, remember, Apple said there's nothing wrong with our antennas.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.480]   You're holding it wrong.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.160]   Apparently, consumer reports disagree,
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.880]   because they didn't recommend the iPhone 4.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.040]   This was really what got Steve Jobs to come back from Hawaii.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.400]   We've now learned in the biography and address antennagate.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.800]   He was irate.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.680]   He really had to be talked down.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.560]   I think handled it well.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.560]   Well, now, Consumer Reports says the iPhone 4x
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.200]   fixes the antenna problem, and they are recommending the 4s.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:15.640]   Now, how much of that do you think consumer reports is just
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.800]   sticking to their guns?
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.360]   Like, they made an unpopular argument saying,
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.200]   we can't recommend the iPhone 4.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.840]   But then, once they said that on the record,
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.960]   they started to stick with it.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.080]   Even though there were so many features about the iPhone 4
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.840]   and about the 4s that were popular,
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.520]   they had to wait until they're like, OK, I guess, now we can read it.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.840]   I know, I trust those guys.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.240]   I'm not buying it.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.120]   I think they fixed it.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.560]   They did mention that they read--
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.120]   So let's see.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.520]   You know, I have five bars right now on the old iPhone 4
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.040]   in this same--
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   Some people need to carry.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.400]   Oh, lost several.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.080]   In the same iPhone 4--
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:45.920]   That's fine.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.360]   Let's see.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.760]   In the same area--
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.840]   Holding it this way, with my palm across that plastic strip,
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.000]   would bring this down to zero.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.400]   It is not doing it.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.640]   So I think, in fact, they may have fixed that.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.880]   This is not affected--
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.400]   Keep in mind, my question is not whether or not Apple fixed it.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.440]   I do think Apple fixed it.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.720]   But my question was whether or not it was such a huge deal
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.400]   to begin with.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.600]   Well, it deserves a non-human--
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.200]   Consumer Reports is a very nuts and bolts.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.280]   I mean, you're talking about the Amazon audience.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.960]   That is the consumer reports audience.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.560]   And they're like, if you hold the phone--
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.000]   And it doesn't work.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.640]   That's really stupid.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.040]   And Consumer Reports is like, this is ridiculous.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.040]   Why aren't people talking about this?
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.360]   This is an iPhone 4.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.840]   And then I think when Steve Jobs tells you
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.800]   that you're wrong, it doesn't have to work as a phone,
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.640]   because it's so cool, or you learn how to hold it my way.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.440]   They do talk in the book about the fact
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.560]   that the engineers told Jobs, if you put a metal band
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.920]   around the phone, it's going to be a problem.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.920]   And he and Johnny Ive said, but we don't care.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.120]   It's pretty.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.720]   And this happens time and time again.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.240]   The problem with the reality distortion field
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.000]   doesn't affect physics yet.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.840]   And so--
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.640]   I like the fact that you put yet and there.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.960]   It may have written that code for the--
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.120]   It'll go to zero.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   I've done this many, many times.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:55.760]   We aren't now.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.240]   I should point out we're in a marginal AT&T area.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.200]   Even though there is a--
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.840]   California is a marginal AT&T area.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.040]   They're both in the same cell tower.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.440]   It's not happening with the cell.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.040]   We're making that go down.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.760]   Yeah, it's not happening with the 4S.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.280]   The other interesting thing is with this battery problem,
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.720]   Apple has put out two announcements saying,
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.240]   yes, there was a battery problem.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.800]   We think we fixed it for most users.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.760]   And then when it didn't happen, came back and said,
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.280]   we fixed it for most users.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.480]   We're still hearing reports that there may be problems
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.400]   and we're investigating those for the few users.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:23.040]   I don't think they would have put out those--
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.240]   That's a real--
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   That's a real--
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.640]   That is a post Steve Jobs.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:28.280]   You know, it's better.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   And I don't know if this--
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.280]   I haven't done this in a year and a half
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:34.000]   since the iPhone came out before it came out originally.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.440]   And this would have been zero by now.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.920]   So they may have actually improved the tower
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.760]   in Penaluma.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.120]   Or at least improved the display to not convince--
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.000]   Oh, you know what?
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:42.640]   They did.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:43.640]   I forgot.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.720]   They didn't even say that.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.240]   All right.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:45.600]   And so--
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.680]   They even said, like, oh, well, there's a problem with the display.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.040]   It's the first time we calculate those bars.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:54.240]   Anyway, so I think that's kind of interesting.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.240]   I don't know what to say.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.200]   If you have the first generation nano--
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   Uh-oh.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.080]   First generation nano.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.280]   What's the one on you?
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:01.760]   I know.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.280]   I know.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.720]   Actually, that's a long time ago.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.120]   That's the one that was like a little candy bar.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.600]   And the problem here is, of course,
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.480]   that some of them are leaking and exploding and battery issues.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:10.960]   Oh, come on.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.120]   They're five years old.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:12.400]   Right.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.360]   Well, and here's the problem, though,
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.160]   is who are the people who still have these?
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.000]   It's not you and me.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.920]   It's our children who get our hand-me-downs.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.440]   Right.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.520]   And what's funny, this is the kind of thing
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:20.960]   I would totally ignore.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.160]   It's going to blow up the kids.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.720]   No, it's-- well, I just--
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.680]   And this is the kind of thing I would totally ignore,
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.520]   except for my daughter does play with my five-year-old--
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.600]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.480]   --I plot nano.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.520]   And so it's just like, well, I don't want--
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.960]   And you know, kudos to Apple for--
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.560]   I mean, this is a long--
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.760]   you know, this has been out since September 2005.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.200]   They are actually replacing them with brand new iPods.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.720]   Well, OK.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.480]   Are they replacing them with brand new iPod nanos?
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.960]   They must be using the new nanos,
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.000]   because I can't imagine--
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.120]   They wouldn't make old ones.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.280]   They're going to have old nanos.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.640]   But they could do refurbished old ones or something.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.480]   It's probably not worth it.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.320]   It's probably worth it just to use.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.480]   You know, I don't know.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.720]   Does the chat room know-- what do you get if you exchange it?
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.000]   So I'm going to have said that you actually get a--
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.040]   Another first generation nanos.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:02.520]   Another first generation nanos.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.240]   Yeah, that's what it looked like from the article I read,
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.880]   which is silly to me.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.920]   These are, by the way, one gigabyte.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.320]   But understand also, this is not a testament
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.080]   to what an upstanding company Apple is.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.080]   This is a testament to the calculus that goes into it.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.320]   There's that great scene in Fight Club,
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.600]   where they talk about how the formula is,
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.800]   you multiply the percentage of failures
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.920]   by the out-of-court settlement.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.240]   And then if it's greater than the cost of a recall,
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.280]   you know, that's when you bother to do one.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.800]   But outside of that, you know--
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.320]   Brian, I have a suggestion.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:32.840]   Yes.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.160]   Decaf.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.920]   No, his hair doesn't do that automatically.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.600]   He has to actually make it do that.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.000]   It's not the coffee.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.880]   So I spoke on Monday to a Pubcom, which
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:44.920]   is your webmaster world.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.160]   It's a SEO group.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.720]   These are people who have spent their last few years
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.920]   figuring out the internals of how Google works
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.560]   so that they can go to their clients and make sure
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.840]   that they do well in the search engine results.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.400]   You know, there's some snake oil in SEO,
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.520]   but there's some legitimate SEO you can do.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.240]   I made a mistake.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.240]   Somebody asked me, what do you think the future of Google is?
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.640]   And I said, oh, Google's in deep trouble,
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.520]   because they are-- because Siri, among other things,
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.400]   is going to intermediate between you and Google
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.200]   on mobile platforms.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.200]   This is why Google created Android, I believe.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.320]   Apple is going to-- is determined to replace Google
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.200]   as search engine.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.400]   And as you get Siri to more and more platforms for Apple,
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.240]   and I do believe they're going to put it everywhere,
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.240]   and maybe Microsoft even does this,
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.840]   because Microsoft does have a search engine of their own,
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.280]   it may be just a year or two before people
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.920]   are talking to their computer instead of searching on Google,
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.840]   asking their computer for the answer,
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.400]   and the computer is intermediating between them
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.880]   and Google and replacing ultimately.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.200]   Number one, that's 100% right.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:42.960]   Number two--
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.200]   They were unhappy.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.200]   They were really unhappy.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.880]   Well, number two, I'm going to say
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.560]   that if there's going to come a time--
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.880]   at first, it's going to be about how the voice sounds,
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.200]   and it's going to be about voice packs,
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.800]   and it's going to be about what kind of personality
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.000]   do you want to interact with.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.720]   But in 10 years, it's going to be about staff
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.800]   writers for what kind of personality
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.400]   do you want your--
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.200]   Oh, isn't that interesting?
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   --your particular--
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.680]   --virtual butler to have.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.400]   But Siri's using Google.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.720]   Right now, Siri is using Google for web search.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.160]   But it doesn't mention Google, and it doesn't need to mention
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.160]   Google, and it could be anything--
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.880]   But it also uses--
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.080]   Wolfram Alpha, right?
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.200]   It uses Yelp.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.480]   And how easy would it be to just swap out the nuts and bolts?
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.520]   And you would never even know it.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.800]   Siri would still sound the same.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:22.840]   She'd still say the same thing.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.120]   And you'll always want to sit at your desktop and talk to it,
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.400]   as we all know, because voice recognition is totally
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.920]   eliminated keyboards.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.280]   It will, along with physical media.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.880]   That's not true.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.720]   Oh, yes, it is.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.240]   Well, no, no, because there are social dynamics
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.800]   where it's inappropriate for me to be talking over other people.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.760]   For example, here at the table, I
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.120]   could fire off a quick tweet or something like that.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.680]   There is a value to nonverbal communication.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.840]   We haven't solved that yet.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.440]   Although the ability to recognize your mouth moving
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.960]   without making sound and be voice recognition is there,
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.360]   that could be the fix.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.720]   So we all could sit here like this.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.920]   You mean like those phony commercials
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.920]   or the Herman Cain thing, or saying one thing,
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.360]   because they got a good-- you've seen these.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.360]   The bad lip.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   The bad lip.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.360]   Patrick, Patrick solved this.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   He's got the brain tap.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.360]   And that's the other way to do it.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.360]   I think it's just--
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.360]   I mean, you're saying--
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.520]   Guys, you're all nuts.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.720]   Says the inventor of the Devorak keyboard.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.120]   So Eric Schmidt--
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:19.200]   Eric Schmidt, I have to point out,
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.680]   speaking before Congress, the Senate subcommittee,
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.640]   says Siri is a threat to Google search business.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.880]   OK, but that's also--
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.200]   This is also to justify the position.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.200]   He does.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.040]   He's trying to convince--
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.680]   Congress is saying, why aren't you a monopoly
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.680]   that we should bust up?
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.480]   And he's like, no, there's not a competition.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:36.960]   Siri.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.480]   Big competition.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:39.720]   Everybody was saying this is about Facebook.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.720]   It's killing it.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.720]   Facebook's going to kill Google.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:41.720]   It is.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.720]   Everyone's searching on Facebook.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.760]   Social search.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.480]   Social search is the future.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.880]   Just stand back.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.160]   Watch out.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.080]   Where'd you get that t-shirt?
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:50.720]   T-shirt.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.160]   I mean--
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:51.520]   I mean--
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.520]   I'm a hoomoo.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.960]   It's a mo-mo-mo.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.880]   Where'd you get that one?
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.040]   That's a hilarious one.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:56.560]   You love it.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.040]   You know what?
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:57.920]   It's sold and has floppings.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:58.920]   This is from the screensavers.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:58:59.720]   Patrick probably remembers it.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.440]   Oh, this is that era where you were wearing these cool shirts.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.560]   And then the suits--
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.200]   They said it.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.480]   You can't wear bowling shirts.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.520]   You can't wear these shirts.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.800]   Yeah, this is a fact.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.160]   The suits came up to him and said, Leo,
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.200]   we don't think it's business appropriate for you
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.600]   to be wearing these crazy shirts on the air.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.320]   They also got the redoers for each other.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.680]   And I'll never forgive them for that.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.840]   Because no one wears crazy shirts on television.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.960]   Yeah, no, heaven forbid.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.080]   You might attract attention.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.600]   You maybe get your numbers out.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.880]   No, I think Greg Dreyben, who was an ultra hip.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.120]   He was the original hipster.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.320]   Thought it wasn't cool.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.920]   It wasn't cool enough to wear.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.720]   I think there was--
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:31.080]   Actually, there's a bunch of stuff that came--
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:31.560]   Oh, these are embarrassing.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.560]   Actually, from "Valk Adventures."
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.280]   Oh, you think it was--
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.120]   You think it was actually targeted by "Valk Adventures."
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.240]   Paul Allen didn't like your kill?
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:37.680]   No.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:41.200]   Some people that Paul Allen hired from LA was like--
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.440]   America doesn't like the kill.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.160]   I was embarrassed showing this to my friends.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:44.600]   Wow.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.120]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.720]   I could see Paul Allen saying that.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.080]   I am having fun.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.000]   I don't know about you guys.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:50.920]   I hope you're following the--
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.840]   We are miserable, yeah.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.000]   --falling the conversation.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.720]   Brian Brushwood is here from Scam School, of course, NSFW,
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.160]   which is every--
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:58.720]   I never know.
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.320]   Wednesday?
[00:59:59.320 --> 00:59:59.800]   Tuesday?
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.640]   Every Tuesday, every Tuesday, of course.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.160]   Whatever.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.160]   He moves in a way that's something to do with.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.320]   But the problem is we do a lot of shifting around
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.520]   because, of course, I'm touring with the live stage show.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.320]   And so sometimes I get booked on Tuesdays
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.320]   and makes it complicated.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.080]   But whenever we can, we try to get it on Tuesday.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.580]   Yes.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.120]   Whenever we just follow the tweets, that's the only one.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.000]   Right after Ham Nation, which is--
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.160]   It's like the collision of the world.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.160]   Oh, she's a combination doing it.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.000]   She got these old hands.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.480]   And then they go, it's time for the kids.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.400]   The kids are going to come on.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.560]   And then you come on.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.240]   We come in with our memes within memes.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.240]   And they have no idea.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.240]   Any cats.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.080]   Yes.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.720]   You know, we're going to take this conversation over
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.120]   to the 20 meter band.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.120]   We'll see you there.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:37.960]   I'll tell you what, though.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.960]   I want to go full circle and have the Ham Nation crossover
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.160]   where they have-- I want to get my amateur license, actually.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.160]   You should totally.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.280]   Everyone should tell you.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.440]   Ham, that's up to me.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.160]   We got two out of the five people here, Ham's.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:49.640]   Really?
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.960]   Can you pick which two?
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.160]   Well, I'll tell you what, ma'am, when the zombies come in.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.120]   She's nodding.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:54.800]   She said, yeah.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.600]   When the solar flares knocks stuff out,
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.200]   it's going to be the hands that rule the earth.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:58.400]   Wow.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.120]   No, actually, solar flares are bad for us.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:00.480]   Yes.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.960]   Yes.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.960]   Actually, pretty much everything kills a Ham signal I've
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.080]   found, including smart meters.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.480]   What are you doing?
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.640]   What are you doing, John?
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.480]   I'm watching you.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.560]   You're being disruptive.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.320]   I am, yes.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.760]   Give me that chewing gum.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.920]   You started acting like a show.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.720]   I'm going to send you the printhead set gum.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.240]   Anyway, thank you for being here, Brian Rushard.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.720]   Tom Merritt, the host of TNT, our daily--
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.640]   actually, how are you going to do this?
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.800]   What?
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.360]   The week ahead.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.480]   Oh, I'll just go over there and do that.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   Will you just go over there and do it?
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.520]   Normally, I'm just over there.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.400]   So I'll just--
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:29.920]   OK, good.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.160]   Do you want to do that now?
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:31.600]   Really?
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.680]   We'll see.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.160]   Let's see.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.600]   Let's check in right now.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.560]   Tom Merritt, a host of TNT.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.680]   It does the--
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.240]   I'll give him a couple of minutes to get over there.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.000]   He does our great daily news show,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.160]   2.30 p.m. Pacific, 5.30 Eastern, Monday through Friday.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.760]   Tom, what's coming up on the week ahead?
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.200]   Yeah, hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.920]   Here's a look at what we'll be covering on Texas today.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.680]   Hey, this is bogus.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.680]   This is bogus.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.200]   This is bogus.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.880]   It's the last day of Science Hack Day in San Francisco.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.800]   Also, Mario 3D Land launches.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.040]   Monday, November 14th is the Enterprise 2.0 conference,
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.720]   and Santa Clara kicks off on Monday,
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.960]   runs through the 17th.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.240]   Tuesday, November 15th, the Amazon Kindle Fire Ships.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.600]   Also, the deadline for submitting data set ideas
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.320]   to the KDD Cup and Halo Combat Evolved is launching.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.920]   Wednesday, November 16th is my mom's birthday.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.720]   Also, Google Music has a these go to 11 event--
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.120]   well, we think it's Google Music.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.720]   Also, the Lumia 800 arrives in the UK.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.800]   Thursday, November 17th, Motorola Mobility Stockholders
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.120]   will vote on the $12.5 billion Google merger--
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.480]   I'm betting they're voting in favor of it.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.480]   And Friday, November 18th, legend of Zelda's Edward Sword
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.840]   comes to Europe, and the Active Authentication Proposers Day
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.920]   meeting will be held in Arlington, Virginia.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.160]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.040]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.120]   Thank you, Tom.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.680]   That's great.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.760]   Right over there.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.360]   Ran over there, did that.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.520]   What take a merit?
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.440]   Beautiful.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:55.960]   Beautiful.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.960]   Well done.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.440]   Well done.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.200]   It's amazing.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.960]   Well, Eileen was inserting those on the fly.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.600]   That's amazing.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.240]   We have the best production team in the world.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.040]   Did you notice that you have a different t-shirt on now?
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.160]   Did you change it on the way back?
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:06.840]   No, he doesn't.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.320]   No, he doesn't.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.080]   Don't try that.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:08.580]   We know.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.480]   Why would you change that?
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.440]   It's called magic.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.440]   You didn't have that purple thing on just a minute ago.
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.720]   What'd you do to put it back on?
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.720]   It slides under the--
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.600]   It slides under the sleeve.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.680]   See, probably just didn't see it.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.680]   Keep trying, John.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.080]   He made up the Grinch Show with--
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:21.580]   What?
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.080]   Cottonwood, he was perfect.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.880]   I'm not going to be beaten at this game.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.200]   Hey, we are going to take a break.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.800]   Also, of course, John C. to Warwick, channel.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.560]   to Warwick.com.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.920]   Great to have John and noagendocheau.com.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.360]   And my good buddy, Patrick Norton, from Texas,
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.160]   Zilla.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.680]   But first, I should mention--
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.280]   Carbonite.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.400]   Carbonite, I did my--
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.360]   I did my--
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.440]   I didn't bring my clipboard.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.960]   That's why I don't know what's going on.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.520]   Carbonite, of course, is backup done, right?
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.920]   We've talked about Carbonite before.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.080]   This is the best backup service.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.960]   Automatic in the cloud backup.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.960]   And I'm telling you, disasters happen,
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.920]   but they will never happen to you if you've got a Carbonite
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.560]   backup.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.800]   And they listen, too.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.400]   Let me tell you.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.920]   Carbonite online backup-- remember,
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.040]   we've talked about this before.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.640]   It's unlimited backup, $59 a year--
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.440]   less than $5 a month-- for all the data, as much data
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.440]   as you have on your internal drive.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.400]   But people came to us and they said, well, wait a minute.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.280]   I want to backup external drives, too.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.640]   So Carbonite has responded.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.680]   If you go to Carbonite.com now, you
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.680]   will see they have several different plans,
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.720]   depending on what you want to backup.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.560]   If it's your internal drive, if it's a laptop,
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.440]   still less than $5 a month, very affordable backup
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.680]   for external drives, too.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.200]   Small businesses, too.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.200]   It is fantastic.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.760]   Carbonite has really responded, as always,
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.600]   and has given us new ways to backup three plans, all unlimited,
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.640]   depending on what you want to backup.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.440]   I want you to go to Carbonite.com right now
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.640]   and take a look at these new plans-- the Home, Home Plus,
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.800]   and Home Premier.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.840]   Pick the one you want.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840]   You could try it free.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.320]   For two weeks, just use the offer code, Twitch.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.840]   By the way, two weeks is usually enough to get that entire first backup done.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:00.920]   And now, if you decide to buy, I want you to use the offer code,
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.720]   Twitch, again, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.920]   Whatever plan you choose, 14 months of the price of 12.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.000]   It's encrypted.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:09.880]   It's safe.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.680]   It works easily.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.640]   It's cloud storage, too.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.080]   You can log on to your Carbonite account from any computer, Mac or PC,
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.480]   smartphone, tablets, Blackberries.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.640]   There's your stuff.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.760]   Carbonite backup, it's the best.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.200]   Try it free for two weeks at Carbonite.com.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.280]   Use the offer code, Twitch, and when you buy, you'll get two months.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.160]   14 months of the price of 12.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.240]   When you go to Carbonite.com and use the offer code, Twitch.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.440]   I should point out, they don't yet have Mac clients for Home Plus and Home Premier.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:34.840]   They will.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.680]   They're working on it.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.480]   One of the things, Carbonite, I think-- and I really admire them for this--
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.960]   when they write their clients, they really
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.600]   want them to be native, they want them to fit, they want them to work with Lion.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.880]   The home version does work beautifully with Lion,
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.360]   and they want to make sure the same thing happens for Home Plus and Home Premier.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.480]   And they are working on that.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.640]   That'll be just around the corner.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.400]   But if you've got Windows, try it now.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.440]   Carbonite.com.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.680]   Everybody's back in their seats.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.440]   The only guy who does--
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.920]   He just shoved those--
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.760]   He wasn't a schwood.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:02.280]   That was very shwood.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.120]   You're a schwood.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:08.400]   He wanted to see a slowly walking JCD looking, just whip out a gun right at your face.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.240]   He pranks you, man.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.280]   He sold a trigger.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]   Unbelievable.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280]   He should be on the game.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.280]   There was some part of me that thought this is how it ends.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.280]   Unsestinated by John C. de Vorac on Twitch.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280]   It was possible.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.280]   You know, it might be good for ratings.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280]   Just to follow.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   Cut the three, cut the three, cut the three.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280]   His show, Double.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   We could see the last in this episode.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   I've been banking hundreds of them for my family as a state.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.880]   So you did mention-- somebody mentioned something I thought we should talk about when
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.240]   we come back, but I don't remember what it was, so I'll move on.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.240]   Do you remember?
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240]   I don't.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.240]   Do we bring up some time?
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.240]   I should be honest, I haven't been paying much attention.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.240]   All right.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.240]   Shooch wood for ratings.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.240]   That's the name of the show.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.960]   By the way, you know who said that?
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.960]   Denise Howell.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.240]   So our hosts are now, you know.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.240]   So it's legal.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.240]   We already know that.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.240]   No, it's him.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.400]   So what happened to iTunes Match?
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.440]   It was supposed to launch at the beginning of the month.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.440]   This is the--
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.440]   Was it the launch at the end of October?
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:05.440]   I thought this was going to be really cool.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.200]   This is $29 a year.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.040]   They take all the pirated music on your hard drive, replace it.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040]   They're just legit.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040]   Well, they don't say it all that way.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.040]   They're pirated or not.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040]   They're pirated or not.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040]   Legally or not.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040]   And they make it legit.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.680]   But, and to be honest, it's like they still come out ahead.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.520]   Let's assume for sake of discussion that every single song you have is totally pirated,
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.520]   right?
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520]   This is what?
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.520]   $25 a year, is that right?
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.520]   Yes.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.680]   This is not that much cheaper than signing up for a subscription service like MOG or Spotify
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.680]   or one of those things.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.680]   Oh, so it's a lot cheaper.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.680]   That gives you--
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.680]   Well, no, MOG is 10 bucks a month.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   Spotify is 10 bucks a month.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.680]   So, so--
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.680]   So it's $120?
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.680]   $29 or $8.99.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.920]   I'm paying for MOG and I'm paying 10 bucks.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.520]   $5 a month plan is the cheapest one.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.240]   Yeah, but you can't use it on mobile devices.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.720]   So you really want the $10 a month.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.720]   Right.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.880]   But even $5 is still a lot more.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.120]   But the point is, what if I told you that for--
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.200]   Yeah, what is your point, Freshwood?
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   My point is--
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.200]   It's on the top of his head.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.200]   I'm down to-- we'll call it what?
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   $3 a month, right?
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.200]   Cheap.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.200]   Or $2.50.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   But you get what?
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.320]   5% the catalog, 1% the catalog that you would get if you signed up for MOG or Spotify
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.320]   or one of these other services.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.320]   No!
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.320]   But you have songs, don't they?
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:13.080]   No, because you only get access to the music that you bother to pirate before you signed
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.080]   up for MOG.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.080]   Oh.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.080]   You don't get all the songs out of it.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.000]   So what you're saying is, I should have pirated every song.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   No, no, no.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.040]   What you should do is just go ahead and pay three more, eight more dollars a month.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040]   And you have Spotify.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040]   And you got millions of songs.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.640]   The difference is you own this song after you put the $25.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.640]   So you own it.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.640]   You have now--
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.300]   And by the way, they replace those 92 kilobits, Napster songs I downloaded of Dolby Grey's
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.080]   drift away with a 256.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   You got that too.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.840]   With I think it's 256 kilobit AC or 320 kilobit AC.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.840]   It's very high quality.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.840]   Tin soldier.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840]   And that is Tin soldier.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.840]   Love that song.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.840]   So now that Tin soldier--
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.240]   But it doesn't replace them with non-DRM versions.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.240]   Yeah, it does.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.840]   So you can match everything, wipe your hard drive and just read down the line.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.840]   Yeah, baby.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.840]   Okay, well that is worth it.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.840]   But that--
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840]   I would do it for one year.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   Well, that was a long way to do that.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.840]   You know what?
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   You know what?
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.840]   You might be worth it.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.960]   But although there is a hint because November 12th, which was yesterday--
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960]   Yes.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:18.320]   November 16th, I was doing the math.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.400]   November 12th, which was yesterday, they deleted all the developer libraries.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   This is the fifth time they've done that.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.400]   Oh, never mind.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.400]   Really?
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   Yeah, they keep doing it because--
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   Thinking they're going to launch?
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.120]   They-- every time they update the iTunes beta with iTunes match, they make the developers
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.840]   delete all their songs, turn it off.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:34.840]   Well, that sucks.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.160]   You can do the new iTunes beta and then you can try it again.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.120]   By the way, up to a maximum of 25,000 songs.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   Oh, that's--
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.600]   Well, so the other shoe dropping here was when they made them deleted again, everybody
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.960]   said, "Okay, maybe this is it."
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.960]   Right.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.920]   They put it out and then they put out another iTunes beta.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.560]   And so when the iTunes beta came out yesterday, everyone said, "Well, crap, now we have to
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560]   wait."
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.480]   Any thoughts as to why this is the North Carolina data center not ready?
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.760]   I mean, Siri's been having trouble.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.080]   It still goes down, eh, periodic.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.600]   I think they're trying to make sure that they don't have another mobile me on their
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   hands.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.600]   They want to make sure it works right.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.960]   Well, and also keep in mind that when people use the service, your number one, you're going
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.000]   to have a massive number of people all at the exact same moment trying to have the service.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.920]   And this is not going to be a minor update for each person.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.480]   We're talking about gigantic libraries, hundreds of gigabytes in some cases.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.320]   As many as 25,000 songs.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.320]   Now, the good news, I don't have to upload those songs, but if I say, and I know people
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.120]   are going to do this, oh, and by the way, I'd like all those songs now.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   Right.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120]   Exactly.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.960]   It still takes a long time for them to scan through and say, "Do we have this song or
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   not?"
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.960]   That's the other thing too.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.280]   The biggest benefit to this would be if you have rare bootlegs of certain albums, that's
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.280]   the big thing.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280]   That's the big reason.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.280]   That's the reason to own instead of these songs.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.480]   And by the way, man, they say if we don't have the song, you may upload it.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.480]   Oh, wow.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.240]   It goes through and matches, and then anything it doesn't match, it then uploads.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.400]   No, but what does that do?
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:54.760]   There was, back in before I was reformed, good guy, there were these archives of gigabytes
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.480]   of gigabytes of nothing but Grateful Dead live bootlegs.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.480]   Sure.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.640]   Well, I don't think they distribute those for you, right?
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.280]   I think that they give a copy of it.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.280]   They're all like your own locker.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.280]   Yeah, it's a locker service.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.720]   That's why the subscription thing is in a big comparison for me.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.960]   They better because it's just locker versus subscription.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:14.080]   Because I saw Tom Merritt on this week ahead talk about November 16th, which if I'm not
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.880]   mistaken as Wednesday, Google's got an announcement.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.960]   These go to 11.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.960]   That's right.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   That's got to be their music announcement.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960]   We think it's Google Music.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   It's got to be Google Music, right?
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.840]   Featuring, and I think we all agree that they're going to have Spinal Tap play live at the event.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   Oh, wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   Oh, I'm sure they're playing.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.840]   Nigel Tuffnell should show up.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.920]   It was his day on Friday.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.920]   11-11-11.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.920]   That's true.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.920]   Nigel Tuffnell day.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920]   He should show up.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.400]   Do you know what we're talking about, John?
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.120]   Lawrence, well, at 40 years.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120]   All right.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.720]   The word on the screen is going to go ahead and launch Google Music without all four major
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.720]   labels.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.240]   By the way, I didn't know this.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.240]   The email came from Nigel Tuffnell.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.240]   What I tell you, this is an interview to you.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.880]   They're going to be the Christopher Gaddes.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.960]   I didn't know that, but that is hysterical.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.680]   No, they're definitely going to show up in Google Music is going to launch with only
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.680]   Spinal Tap songs.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.560]   Tom, I think it's Wednesday.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.560]   I think 2 p.m.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.120]   I think we should probably go live and stream that coverage.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.360]   There is a live stream at youtube.com/anturo.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.680]   What is up with that?
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.880]   Right in the middle of Twig?
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.880]   That's right.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.880]   Right in the middle of Twig.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:16.880]   They know what they're doing.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.080]   I guess I was thought they're good.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.520]   Well, we'll just jump right in during Twig because that's our Google show at 1 o'clock
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.240]   and now we're in, we'll jump into it.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.720]   Universal is buying EMI according to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.920]   This kind of surprises me for $1.9 billion.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.720]   Does that seem like a lot or a lot?
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.720]   It seems low.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.520]   It's the Beatles catalog among other things.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520]   Does this mean?
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.600]   Right, but they're only buying the music recorded, the recorded music.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.160]   The publishing is going to Sony.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   Ah, okay, that makes sense.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   They didn't get the publishing.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160]   They got the recording right.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.800]   Sony is being $2.2 billion for the publishing.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   That's worth more.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.680]   All right, well that makes it.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.680]   That's interesting.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   Why?
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.680]   So EMI is getting out of the meetings.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:01.600]   They got their owners, their capital owners went bust and City got them in a, you know,
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.200]   like a basically a default settlement.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.800]   So City's been trying to find a buyer for a long time.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.560]   I might have buried the lead.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:13.400]   But Dobi this week announced that it's not going to put flash on mobile platforms anymore.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.360]   I got to get engaged the right side of the table.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.000]   Yeah, all you do is talk into brushwoods.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   Sorry, my fault.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.960]   It's like you're in love with the guy.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   Look at him.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.960]   You're just jealous, John.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.360]   John Sperns is a dangerous thing.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.360]   I don't think he can.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.040]   I think this is interesting because if you give up the mobile platform, given the growth
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.840]   of the mobile platform, the importance of the mobile platform, aren't you really giving
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   it all up?
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.840]   I mean, how, so what if they keep the desk?
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.840]   I don't know why she has brushwood.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.120]   Okay, so I think you might have something germane and relevant to say.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.120]   Let him go on and on.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.120]   Oh, my God.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.120]   This is like my decafone.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   I think he's ever, ever gone.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.200]   I'm going to shoot me next time I open my mouth.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:55.120]   I think part of the thing that people overlook is so many websites don't actually have a
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.440]   mobile version or a mobile platform.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.720]   And it's like on one hand, it's like Steve Jobs made it his personal goal to crush flash.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720]   And succeeded.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.720]   I think he's doing a little turn.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:07.200]   I think it was they have some issues with it on them.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.200]   It doesn't work.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.200]   It never did work.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.200]   Yeah, but it's giving up.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   They're going to support HTML5 and I think that's basically what's going to happen is
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.880]   HTML5 one instead of by the way, well, I said that has problems doing your thinking voice.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880]   It has all kinds of issues.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:27.360]   You mean, you're talking about web M the Google of all of the HTML5 has got problems, but
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.600]   I don't think that Steve won.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.040]   I think Adobe won.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.160]   They just held out and now that Steve is gone, they say, okay, well, I guess he was right.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.240]   I'm sorry, but we're not giving up till Steve is dead.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.200]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.840]   I think it is a possibility.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.840]   Is that sick?
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.840]   I don't know.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.840]   And let's be clear.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.840]   They're not killing it on the desktop.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.840]   No, but that's the moment.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:53.320]   My point being if you don't support it on any mobile device and I'm a guy doing a website,
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.920]   if I'm YouTube, am I going to continue doing flash in any form or fashion?
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:02.000]   No, I'm going to find an alternative so that my desktop, as you say, my desktop website
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   looks fine on a mobile platform.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.520]   I think it's going to be interesting.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.600]   It's funny because Mike Chambers, I think it's the, I was reading an article a couple
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.960]   days later, Mike Chambers, who's, I think is titled the principal product manager for
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.440]   developer relations for the flash platform at Adobe.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.080]   Oh, how do they fit that on a car?
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   I don't know.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   It's a big car.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:23.160]   He was like, he basically was like clarifications on the flash player for mobile browsers,
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:28.280]   the flash platform in the future of flash on his blog.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.480]   And how did he clarify this?
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.480]   Is there a future?
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.680]   Well, it's kind of fun.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.840]   First he talks about the announcement, which is basically mobile applications created with
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.840]   Adobe Air.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   But Air.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.480]   It's, it's, it's expressive content, particularly games and video and the browser on the desktop
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.880]   by the flash player.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.200]   We are increasing the amount of resources towards HTML5 tools.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.200]   That's the truth.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.880]   Three, we are no longer going to be actively developing the flash player for mobile browsers.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.560]   Quote, it is his last point, which received the most attention, caused the most confusion
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.240]   and essentially overshadowed all of the other information.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.080]   He's trying to make it look at the other two points, but it doesn't change the fact that
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:07.160]   they are after 11.1, which came out Friday, they are not going to be developing new flash
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.160]   players.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.480]   They'll continue to support that one for a while.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.440]   RIM said they're going to continue to develop a flash player, though.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.840]   I mean, basically he says, yeah, I heard that.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.840]   That'll save Blackberry.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:17.840]   That's a good one.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:18.840]   Like that's who you want.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.840]   That'll save Blackberry.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.840]   I reached her overall goal.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:28.200]   Actually, to be honest, that's, that's what Google or Android developers are trying
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.640]   to do to save the Android tablet platform and say, well, we have flash, we have flash.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   We have flash.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   We're no longer a big deal to this.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.040]   It's basically like, why did Adobe decide to no longer develop the flash player for mobile
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   browsers?
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.760]   It's not getting the same ubiquity in mobile as it has in the desktop.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:43.160]   The ubiquity of HTML5 on browsers.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.800]   It isn't how users consume rich content of mobile devices.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.560]   Scalability of developing plugins for mobile browsers, shifting some resources from flash
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.560]   to HTML5.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.200]   Well, that ubiquity argument pretty much says Apple One.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.040]   If you're not on every mobile platform, you don't exist.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.360]   And it wouldn't have one had iOS not been so successful in the marketplace.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:09.440]   But once you have 150 million iOS devices that can't see flash, you got to respond.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.840]   And it's also, it's also something that flash, I mean, flash was built to do things that
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.440]   the web couldn't do.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:20.200]   And now the web can do, and basically, HTML, you know, some HTML5 programs.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:26.520]   The irony is HTML5, and our chat was pointing this out, HTML5 says WebNet 590.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520]   Really doesn't even exist.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520]   It's a nascent standard.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.720]   There's no, there's no solution for video right now.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.640]   There is no HTML5.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.080]   So Adobe's abdicating, but there's no error to abdicate to.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.280]   Well, there's Adobe error.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.280]   Oh, yo.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.280]   Um, golly.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:47.320]   Is it, is it time to end the show yet?
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.320]   No.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.320]   No.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.320]   Enjoying it that much.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.920]   You got to talk about getting hacked.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.400]   Modern Warfare 3, 6.5.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.400]   Steam got hacked.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   I'm okay.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400]   Skyrim.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400]   Skyrim.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.400]   Awesome.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   Okay.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   Okay.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   Modern Warfare 3 or Skyrim?
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.560]   Oh, I mean, as far as my heart goes, you talk about the Michael Bay movie made into a video
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.720]   game, or you're talking about the most richly detailed fantasy epic of my lifetime.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.720]   With you on that exact.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:15.680]   It is the most beautiful version world of Warcraft I've ever played.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.680]   It's very similar.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.040]   Isn't it weird to release in this day and age a non-online game?
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.400]   Uh, yeah, it is.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.160]   And it's delightful because it's this whole world contained in your laptop.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.760]   And you don't have to worry about teenagers teabagging you.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   That's true.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.240]   Which has always been a problem for me.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.240]   Well, not in the game.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.240]   Well, I'm sorry.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.240]   I didn't mean to wake you up.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.240]   Uh, no, I will say the sky is missing.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.240]   How do you like Tetris these days?
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.240]   You didn't know.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.680]   It's funny you say that because you do the way you're going.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:41.680]   Going on and on about this.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.840]   It's cool about the online game not being, or it's not being online, but on a CD or whatever.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.080]   So what you're going to be saying, you're going to be quoted as saying probably within
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.240]   the next five years, you know, I think it's cool that someone to bring out a new magazine.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.040]   It's in print.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   It's so handy.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.040]   Never happened.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.520]   I'm telling you, physical media is dead.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.760]   You said you're saying about games.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.600]   Look, I'm looking on the up band.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.200]   Mark this time, whatever it is.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.200]   Is that thing still running?
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.200]   No.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.200]   It's 420.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   It's 420.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.880]   It's 420.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.040]   And mark my words.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.440]   420 on what is the date of number 13?
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.120]   We're referring to marijuana is what you're doing, right?
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.040]   Thank you, John.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.040]   Thank you.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.040]   Thanks, dad.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.040]   Wait, wait, you're pointing that out.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   Keep talking about marijuana.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.040]   I'm trying to keep up.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.040]   I can't read through your subtlety.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.040]   Thank goodness I got a big PC to high five.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:38.280]   You just hit the guy from his audience.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.280]   Go kill our audience.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.280]   We really don't have enough.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.280]   Is it not really?
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.280]   Go around.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.600]   He's losing shots being taken.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.440]   Did you read this article in The New York Times by Claire Kane Miller about Google, about
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:57.160]   Larry Page, Google's chief executive, and the bloated ship that is Google?
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.160]   I didn't.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.760]   The bloated ship that is Google?
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.760]   That's what the title is.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.640]   Google's chief works to trim a bloated ship.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.680]   Larry Page so hates wasting time at meetings.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.600]   He once dumped his secretary to avoid being scheduled for them.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.600]   This does not boat well.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.200]   I think this is Larry Page trying to be the next Steve Jobs.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.280]   That's what the article's point is.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:25.480]   He does not much like email either, even his own Gmail saying the tedious back and forth.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.720]   It just takes too long to solve problems.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.560]   He also decrees that.
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:32.920]   I think the story's about our long meetings at Google should be 50 minutes to allow time
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.880]   for bathroom breaks in between.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.000]   You know what I think?
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.920]   You should have to do all meetings standing up.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.840]   This is like the Woody Allen movie Bananas where the guy takes over and the next thing
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.760]   you know he's supposed to wear your underwear on the outside so it can be inspected.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.160]   But here's what I think is right about this kind of...
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   Remember that character?
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160]   Yes.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.120]   I think this is actually a really good point in that great innovations are not born out
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.120]   of love.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.120]   They're born out of hate.
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:21:01.200]   And Penn and Teller say that again because that sounds profound and it might not be,
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.200]   but I just want to hear it again.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.200]   Great.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.200]   Great innovation.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.200]   I'm guessing it's not.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.160]   Of hate, but out of hate.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.840]   And this advice comes from Teller of Penn and Teller who wrote an article...
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.400]   Who probably hates Penn because he never was in talk.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   Exactly.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.400]   Who pointed out that if you...
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.640]   Let's say you have influences in magic and you love a certain type of performer.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:21.280]   If you let that be your influence to develop what your act is going to be, the best you
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.720]   will be is a pale limitation of what you love.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:29.000]   But if you let hate be your driving factor, if you say, "What do I hate about old media?
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   What do I hate?"
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.400]   That's actually my driving force.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   Exactly.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   You create something new that is in your head.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   This is true.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   I hate with hate.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   You hate hate.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   You're a hater.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400]   I'm a hater, bro.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.400]   You hated tech TV.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.400]   I hate the suits.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.400]   No, I didn't hate tech TV.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   I hated what happened to you.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.400]   You hated the suits.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.400]   I hated G4.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.400]   You hated people talking to you with...
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.400]   Tom Caster, I hated Paul.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.600]   I hated the suits.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.400]   You couldn't wear the nice shirt you had.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400]   I hated Patrick.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.400]   I hated everybody.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.400]   So what?
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.400]   Patrick's.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.400]   And beside the point.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.400]   Bringing it back to Larry Page, if what he does...
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.000]   Now, Patrick and I were united in our hate.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   Yes.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   Yes.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.560]   This is the awkward, slow process of email exchanges.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.920]   That's where you get something like Google Docs, where real time everybody can make instant
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.760]   changes and collaborate on the fly.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.320]   That is an innovation born of hate.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   Page requires senior executives to show up at headquarters for informal face-to-face
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.600]   meetings at least once a week to plow through decisions.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:23.720]   In one case, where two senior vice presidents were fighting over email, he called us into
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.880]   his office and said, "You will solve this difference before you leave the room."
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.480]   Because he doesn't like long email threads.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   Right.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   I mean, that's their first person.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.280]   And if he's actually...
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:38.520]   If it's him basically forcing people to deal with stuff quickly, fail quickly or succeed
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.520]   quickly rather than...
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.780]   Because they opened the first couple of lead graphs of this article makes it sound like
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:48.480]   Larry Page is shutting himself in his office and refusing to communicate.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.440]   And then you get down farther and it's basically like he's grabbing people and forcing them
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.440]   to do...
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.440]   He's cutting stuff fast.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.200]   I think this is exactly what Google needs.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.480]   He's kicking some butt.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.800]   I don't know if it's coming out of hate.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.560]   I think you're right though on that hate thing.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.360]   Well, as far as the innovations go now, and this is...
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:07.000]   I don't know anything about running a business, but let me pretend I do because I'm on Twitch.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.720]   That's what we all do.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.320]   You have a company explode, you get very liquid, you suddenly have a lot of cash, you accrue
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:16.520]   a lot of assets so that you can secure your position and then you start trimming the fat.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.800]   And I think Google could be a bloated chip at this point.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800]   It is.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.800]   And I think it's a...
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.520]   31,000 employees, 27.3 billion in revenue this year.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.520]   Remember what Andy Groves said?
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.520]   That doesn't sound...
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.520]   That doesn't sound...
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.920]   The people who have done well in this business have been always looking over their shoulder,
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.920]   right, John?
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.240]   And always saying, "We gotta be better and kicking some butt."
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.240]   So what do you do?
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.240]   I'm terrified.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:37.880]   So did you see what Logitech did with the Google TV?
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.880]   Oh, brother.
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.240]   There was also another quotes here.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.400]   That was Logitech's new CEO throwing the old CEO and Google.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.880]   Oh, I didn't notice that.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.880]   Yes.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.040]   It was basically like, "We bet the farm on Google TV.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.320]   Google TV was a mess.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   We lost 100 million.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   By the way, I'm not the guy who made that decision."
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.320]   Earl P. Quinlan championed the review.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:58.320]   He stepped down in July.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.320]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.560]   The new CEO, Gerino DeLuca, took over.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.800]   DeLuca is the guy who said all this stuff about this.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.920]   This was a disaster, a big mistake, cost the company 100 million dollars in operating
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.280]   profits and we're not going to make another one for a long time.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.280]   You know what's ironic?
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.560]   It might be just as Google TV actually gets good.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560]   Exactly.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.560]   That's the funny thing.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:19.280]   And that's the part that really upset me because when I've seen the Logitech review in
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.280]   action, I really like what it almost does.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:25.480]   I'm excited for the next generation, but if they're going to just set fire to the old
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.480]   company.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.760]   Well, I think that 3.1 or is it Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich?
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:29.760]   It's Honeycomb, they're going to put on it.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.760]   Honeycomb is the one coming on the Sony.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   Honeycomb is the one coming on the Sony.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   Honeycomb is the one coming on the Sony.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   Right now it's coming to the review.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.160]   And that gives me the market, right?
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   The Android market.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.400]   Certainly this becomes a very compelling machine.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.320]   But the problem, and we've talked about this on Friday.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.120]   It's a Web TV at this point.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.120]   It is a Web TV.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.320]   I perceive it as being an underpowered device.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.240]   I don't want to download Android apps onto something that's happening on this one.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.240]   Well, it's not.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.240]   Folks at Plex ported Plex to it.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.000]   And they said we were very pleasantly surprised.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.080]   It had not only had enough horsepower to play all the videos we threw at it.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.720]   It had most of the codecs, even obscure ones that we didn't expect.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.320]   We thought we'd have to support somehow.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.840]   He said it's a surprisingly good platform for Plex, which means it's a good platform
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   for a home theater device.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.520]   But again, they're not selling it on that.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.880]   They're selling it on Angry Birds.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   No, no, and that's who's going to like it as us.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.480]   They were selling it on as being like this place where you would watch TV and there would
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.480]   be a Web element.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.720]   And then they started it in all the major media companies when you didn't give us a
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.720]   cut.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.720]   You didn't sign us a check.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.720]   You didn't make a deal with us.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.720]   We're going to block your device.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.720]   Yeah, but you know what?
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.720]   I have one.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.720]   And that wasn't why I stopped using it.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.600]   I didn't care about not getting mbc.com streaming video.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.480]   The reason I stopped using it is it was buggy.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.480]   And it didn't stream video very well.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:40.880]   And the interface was a little hard to navigate and move around in.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.600]   And I just liked the Roku better.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.600]   It was funny.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.600]   Roku was simple and easy to use.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.520]   My friend Kate actually uses it obsessively because it allows her to do one thing she's
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.080]   always wanted to do.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.160]   Browse the internet on the top of the screen on the screen and it's incredibly effective
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160]   for that.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160]   I'm sure the software updates were up to you.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.440]   I love it that HP had a meeting.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.440]   Oh yeah.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.160]   Who had a meeting?
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.480]   I love that's all you need.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.640]   HP had an all hands meeting.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:12.520]   To tell the people who work in the web on OS division, they're not really sure what
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.320]   they're going to do.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.520]   Why do you need a meeting for that?
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.400]   Well actually I can relate to this because we spent the last what two and a half years
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.680]   in tech TV looking around going like yeah we're going to be sold or they're going to
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:24.680]   fold.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.680]   So maybe we're going to be here in two years.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.880]   Maybe we're going to hit the curve in the hockey stick and we'll be profitable.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.680]   Every all associates meeting was Michaela Pereira going by the way where are we going?
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.680]   What are we doing?
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.680]   Well that's a very good question.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:36.680]   What happened to stock options?
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.680]   Well I don't know what's next time.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.800]   Meg Whitman says if HP decides to keep web OS we're going to do it in a significant way over
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.440]   a multi-year period.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.600]   But then again maybe not.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.000]   That's not a reason for a meeting.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.640]   She said something about not wanting to rush to a decision but then it was all about time
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.920]   with the personal systems group decisions.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.080]   She says it's not exactly obvious what to do.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.600]   What would you do with web OS?
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:08.320]   We need this group to leverage better deals for the stuff we actually want to keep.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.040]   And if we keep selling PCs we get better deals for all the parts of the stuff we actually
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.040]   make decent profits on.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.040]   Right.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.040]   Well I would make sense to keep the PC to do it.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.720]   I would make it open source.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.120]   That's exactly the right answer.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.120]   Congratulations.
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.120]   You're welcome.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.120]   That's what I was looking for.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.120]   Give it away.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.120]   If you're not going to do anything with it open source.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.920]   Well I think they should do it in their way that Netscape did with the Mozilla deal.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.920]   They didn't quite give the whole thing away.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.560]   Well and continue to develop web OS stuff but benefit from the open source development.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.360]   I think that's what John Oegassay should have done with BOS.
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:41.800]   So he said that at that event on Wednesday night at the computer museum he said it's
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.680]   a good thing Apple didn't buy me.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.760]   You know a hindsight it was a good thing they bought next and they got Steve Jobs.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.840]   That was a good thing.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:54.720]   But I think that it's a shame when you see these great products like BOS and OS 2.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.920]   Open source and give them to the community.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   Let them see what they can do.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.720]   I've thrown the OS 2 thing out at IBM.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:00.720]   He loves OS 2.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.360]   Well you know the reason is they have all these little.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   It's proprietary.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.120]   They got a bunch of little code that they bought.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.120]   You can't do it.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.680]   Apparently it wouldn't work.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.840]   What is WebOS based on?
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.680]   Is it from the ground up in a brand?
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.920]   It's not based on a Linux variant.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.400]   I don't think there's a kernel in there.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.400]   I don't know.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.920]   I think that'd be brilliant if they actually open sourced it exactly along the model of
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.920]   the Mozilla Foundation.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:29.120]   You had an actual open source operating system not an operating system that is run somewhat
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.600]   openly and occasionally open source.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:35.320]   The people that use WebOS or were developing for it.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:41.760]   I can kind of tell about the relative importance of various things by the hate mail.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.000]   So I'd make a casual comment in the column.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.200]   I'd not be wrong but I think some of the best inventions of the world are driven not
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   by love but by hate mail.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.640]   Hate mail comes in and the guys read me the riot act about how I'm full of crap about
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.920]   the WebOS and is this and is that and is this.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:58.120]   It says WebOS is based on the Linux kernel.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.120]   It is.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   God damn it.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.120]   It is.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120]   What is it?
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.120]   What are we going to get?
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120]   Everything we said is wrong.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.040]   So you just got to open source everything the rest of the WebOS.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.040]   That's right.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.040]   It makes it easier.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.360]   And if it's based on open source, if it's based on the Linux kernel, which GPL is it because
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:18.480]   maybe it is open source anyway by law by law.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.880]   Let's investigate.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.440]   This needs investigation.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.240]   Well that killed the conversation.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.400]   Yeah, let's take a break.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.640]   Who's our last commercial?
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:30.520]   Well, it's time to thank our lovely sponsors.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.520]   Squarespace.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.960]   I love squarespace.com slash whoa.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.320]   Don't shoot Eileen.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.120]   I think he was aiming for scope.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.120]   I hope he got scoble.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.120]   I was the Eileen.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, Eileen Rivera producer and the host of all about Android.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.800]   Whoo.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:51.280]   Which by the way, if you're wondering about Google TV, we have a great review on our last
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280]   episode, episode 33.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.280]   Did Ron do that?
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.000]   Ron did the review.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.880]   He got it on his Sony Blu-ray player and he did a walk through for us and it's actually
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.880]   looks pretty good.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.880]   I'm a fan.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:06.240]   You know, I'm excited about it and I actually reconnected my Logitech review, which I had
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:11.120]   disconnected because I'm waiting for this 3-1 and I think it could be huge.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.520]   But that's neither here nor there.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:16.200]   Let's talk about squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.440]   Now everybody asks me, what's the best web host?
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.640]   They're always looking for good web hosts.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:23.760]   I say it's very difficult to get sort the wheat from the chaff.
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:29.520]   The best thing to do is go to somebody that's going to have reliable service, lots of uptime,
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.800]   and give you the software you need to run on top of it.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.120]   You know, I should just say squarespace because really that's it.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.120]   Squarespace is hosting.
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.480]   The best hosting out there, you cannot bring a squarespace site down.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:40.760]   We try and we try.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.520]   We are able to bring sites down.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.480]   Never can we do it with squarespace.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.440]   But in addition, you get this incredible software.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.600]   You know, lots of web hosting companies have site builder and they just look awful.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.680]   Every site looks the same.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.080]   They're broken, not squarespace.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:59.800]   This, the templates alone, beautiful designer templates, hundreds of them.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:05.560]   You also get, for if you're a blogger, seamless blog importing, which allows you where to
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.720]   go, went away here.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:13.960]   Let me go back to my squarespace, which allows you to take your existing WordPress template
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:20.720]   or rather content, blogger content, type pad content, and just import it in and export
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.120]   it right back out as soon as you, did we bring squarespace down?
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.120]   Just now?
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.120]   No.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.120]   Okay.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   Scared me for a minute there.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.800]   I've been, I've been doing this commercial.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.600]   I've been trying to bring it down for like three weeks.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.440]   I'm just waiting for Anthony and Dane.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.760]   Would you stop that?
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.760]   Every time, Twits on.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.520]   We know we get this spike in traffic.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.320]   No, you really can't.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.600]   WordPress type pad, blogger and movable type import, which makes it very easy to get your
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.360]   existing site over to squarespace.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360]   And here's the deal.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.640]   You can do this for free for two weeks, all the features.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.200]   So it's a great way to try squarespace.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.720]   See how you like it.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:55.720]   Design a site around it.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.280]   Two weeks, you don't need a credit card or anything.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.000]   Just go to the squarespace site and click the tree.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.280]   The try it free button.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:04.680]   And then if you decide to buy very affordable sites as low as $12 a month, that's hosting
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.120]   plus the best software in the world.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.280]   And I can even make that better.
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:12.040]   Because if you use the offer code TWIT11 when you check out, you'll get 20% off for the
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.240]   first six months.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.840]   So really is a very good deal.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.640]   Squarespace.com, check it out.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:20.640]   Fantastic stuff.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:21.640]   I just, I'm a huge fan.
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:26.480]   I've had a few examples of people emailing me saying that they have used squarespace in
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:31.280]   a business place to make a website for the business, walk up and sell them like here.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280]   I created a website for you.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.280]   Because you could do that with a free two week trial.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.280]   Right.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.280]   And you just hand it over.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.280]   And you just give him the keys in effect.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.280]   Yeah, Alex Lindsey did that.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.280]   He was at a restaurant.
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.280]   They really liked it.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.280]   He said, what's your website?
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.280]   And they said, we don't have a website.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:43.280]   He said, you do now.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.280]   Let me just quickly set this up.
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.280]   He gave it to him.
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:46.280]   That's a great idea.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.280]   Did he get free food?
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.280]   I don't know.
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.680]   But you know what folks, this is a good thing you can do for your friends and people you know,
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.200]   the businesses you love, if they don't have a site, set it up, use a try free button,
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.920]   and then just hand them the password and say, it's yours.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:57.920]   You know, use it if you want.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.120]   Give them the offer code too.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.120]   And actually that's a good idea.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.360]   Give them the Twitter 11 offer code.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.360]   TWIT 11.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.680]   Thank you, Squarespace.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:08.440]   We are, you know, I hope that at some point we're going to be able to use a Squarespace
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.040]   facility in New York because we want to do a Twit in New York thing and that would be
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.040]   really fun to do.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.840]   Well, you're going to open up a Twit office you think?
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.840]   No, no, no.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:15.840]   I could get a place to live.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.840]   I know you wanted a place to live.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:17.840]   But this was just a road trip.
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:18.840]   But maybe someday.
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:19.840]   For sure.
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.440]   You can come on the road trip.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:26.840]   If we had a studio in New York and we had a cot for you like in a corner.
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:29.400]   I'd hope it'd be more than a cot.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:33.440]   Although I've been to some hotels in New York and that's kind of what you get.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.440]   If I guarantee no bed bugs?
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.440]   No.
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.440]   Now I'm talking.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440]   No, I'm talking.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.440]   Is that really such a real thing or is that a hysteria thing?
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.440]   No, I think it's a hysteria.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:45.440]   I don't know.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.280]   Chatroom, how many of you have been bitten by bed bugs?
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.280]   And that's the problem.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.280]   Bedbugregistry.com is a website that has all the things that you're doing.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:53.600]   All the hotels register and they tell them how many.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.520]   It's where the bed bugs want all their marriages.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.520]   Nobody.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.520]   Never.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.520]   Wait a minute.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:59.520]   DV1 has.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.520]   It's real.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.520]   Never.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.520]   Yes.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520]   My mom thought she had bed bugs.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.840]   It turned out it was dust beetles.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.840]   Not the same thing.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.840]   Not the same thing.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:12.440]   And the exterminator said, yeah, we get that a lot.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:15.000]   Because there's a lot of hysteria over the bed bug thing.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.200]   But there's really not a common problem.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.200]   Just like communists.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:19.200]   That's what I thought.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.200]   I have you now or have you ever been a cargold?
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.200]   Bed bug.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.120]   Did you see what Google came?
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.120]   Google came.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.120]   Herman Cain.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.120]   See how well it's working?
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.120]   Google came.
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.120]   Google came.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.120]   That's what his friends call it.
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.560]   I would vote for a president named Google Cain.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.480]   I would change your name to Google Cain.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.040]   And then you got my vote.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.040]   You sir have my vote.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.040]   Google is my candidate.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.040]   Google for my...
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.800]   No, Herman Cain, you know, he's having this problem because people are searching for
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:51.360]   the names of the women that have gone public now in the accusations of harassment.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.360]   What did they do?
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.360]   Very smart.
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.200]   They bought the search results for these names.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.200]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.760]   And tell us you'd vote for Herman Cain.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760]   It does.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.960]   So I'll do a search right now.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.160]   We'll go to google.com.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:08.800]   And I'll do a search for Herman Cain and the name of the woman who he was...
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.520]   Look at this.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.520]   Truece about Herman Cain.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.200]   Get past the lies in allegations.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.700]   Support Herman Cain.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.280]   Very smart.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.680]   Now I have to say, given what he's done with social media, this guy, maybe the most savvy
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.280]   candidate out there in terms of that.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.560]   Or somebody working for him.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.560]   Well, he has.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.080]   He actually has hired very good people working for him.
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:34.560]   And you know what they've done I think is they've managed to kind of raise the suspicion
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:38.000]   that this may not be true by putting those ads right there at the top.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.640]   Whether it's true or not, that's what you want to do, right?
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:46.940]   When you see this with a lot of hucksters, and I don't want to put Herman Cain in that
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:51.220]   category necessarily, but like for example, there are social media experts, there are
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:56.420]   motivational speakers, these people who do like controlling their reputation.
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:01.300]   For example, if you do a search for Asahi Berry, I don't know how you spell it.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:02.300]   Asahi Berry.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.900]   You'll notice that the autocomplete...
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:04.900]   You probably used that.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:05.900]   You look so young.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.900]   It puts the word scale.
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:09.780]   It's a Brazilian Berry from the Amazon.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:15.040]   And then when you look it up, if Asahi Berry's scam, the first things will all be advertisements.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.040]   Oh, look at that.
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:17.040]   You're Asahi Eden work?
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.040]   You want to know why?
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.880]   I've got a proven product.com.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.160]   I see Barry, Luzwein, Bush, your energy.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.160]   So this is good.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   This is a battle.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   A Google.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.160]   You know who wins?
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.160]   Google.
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.160]   Google.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.160]   Google.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.160]   Moneypants.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.440]   Nobody's buying any keyword searches for my name.
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.440]   No.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.440]   You could though, Tom.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.440]   It's not too late.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:37.440]   That's what you know you've made it.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.440]   Do a bid.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:39.440]   Do a bid.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.440]   You've made what, Tom?
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.440]   Yeah, it made you like...
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.440]   It's not like...
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.440]   Yeah, that's what I'm like.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:46.660]   I would actually love to get your take on this one because I'm not sure what I believe
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:47.660]   on this.
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:53.940]   So as you know, WikiLeaks, big issue going on right now about trying to figure out who
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:58.660]   is kind of supporting WikiLeaks.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:05.980]   An Icelandic member of parliament and former WikiLeaks volunteer, Brigida Jonsdottir.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:13.740]   Her Twitter account was handed over by a US judge on Thursday because of the release
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:18.860]   of the US military helicopter friendly fire incident.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.700]   Now she says, and this is what I'd like to know, maybe John, you could comment, this
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.820]   is a huge blow for everybody that uses social media.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:28.220]   We have to have the same civil rights online as we have offline.
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:33.540]   Imagine if US authorities wanted to do a house search at my home in Iceland to go through
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:34.540]   my private papers.
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:36.100]   There'd be a hell of a fight.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.540]   It's absolutely unacceptable.
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:42.140]   She's tweeting on Twitter, they want to see what her Twitter account has.
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:43.140]   They didn't get the content.
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:46.580]   They only got the timing and who she sent the direct messages to.
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:48.860]   Because she was using DMs.
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:49.860]   So what is...
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.740]   You think there's a company that can do whatever they want?
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.740]   What is the merit to her argument?
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:57.580]   I mean, after all, isn't it kind of foolish to be using Twitter to DM stuff?
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:59.540]   Well, it's a US company.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:02.780]   So I guess her argument partly is that she's an Icelandic citizen.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:07.660]   There is another example why you shouldn't trust US companies is what it amounts to.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.460]   Or any company.
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:14.980]   I mean, this is one of the big fears that they have when Google says let's put Gmail, like
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:20.980]   certain governments in Canada say, we're not going to do our Canadian provincial email
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:21.980]   using Google.
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:23.980]   It's like US government gives it this.
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:25.260]   It's giving it handing it over.
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:27.580]   Now the interesting thing is there was not a search warrant.
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:34.180]   They used a 1994 law called the Stored Communications Act.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:37.740]   They asked for bank account details, users names, screen names, other identities, mailing
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:38.900]   and other addresses.
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:43.020]   But no search warrant was awarded nor asked for.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.660]   I like the fact that you looked over at me because this is one of my big Bs.
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:46.660]   I know you're a libertarian.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:50.820]   I'm a big proponent of the Fourth Amendment and I think it's definitely unconstitutional.
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:56.140]   In that Fourth Amendment, there's no equivocation that it clearly says the only way the government
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:57.780]   goes looking through your stuff.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:00.740]   And of course, obviously they didn't envision the internet back in the day.
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:04.780]   But the only way the government goes through your stuff is when a judge writes a warrant
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:05.780]   for it.
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:06.780]   And that's I got a problem.
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.500]   The other related truth is that true.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.780]   If the guys voluntarily handed over again, that's true.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:12.780]   That's true.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.780]   Why are you holding up your phone, Patrick?
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:16.780]   Because actually they just they they just tapped his phone as we speak.
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:18.780]   That's been there for a while.
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:20.780]   I've just been pwned.
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:23.500]   If you get pulled over, if you get arrested, they actually take your phone.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:24.500]   They take everything off.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:26.500]   Some states they can.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.500]   Some states they can't.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:28.500]   That law is not settled yet.
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:29.500]   It's been settled.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:34.700]   So the judge ruled that the Twitter Twitter users voluntarily are turning over their IP
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:39.860]   addresses when they sign up for account and relinquish any expectation of privacy.
[01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:42.500]   Yeah, that is and it is true.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.700]   The private company, they've got their usage license agreements and they can have in their
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:49.380]   provision saying like we'll give your information to anyone or any government that asked for
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.380]   that kind of thing.
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:52.420]   That's not necessarily a constitutional issue.
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:56.020]   But the one that really drives me nuts, and this is also on the dock, is the Supreme Court's
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:40:01.260]   question about whether it's okay to be without a warrant, go into somebody's driveway inside
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:04.420]   their garage and attach a GPS device to cars.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:07.820]   Because the argument, of course, being like, go in their garage.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:12.460]   Well, unfortunately, they actually apparently have been going into driveways and garages
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.460]   on private property.
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:14.460]   Do it.
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.660]   That's well in the discussion in the article that's that's in the dock, it mentions specifically
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:18.980]   inside garages.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:21.940]   But they're saying that the expectation of privacy that you have inside your house is
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.020]   not the same as the expectation of privacy in the driveway.
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:30.260]   The idea being, well, attaching a GPS is pretty much the same as assigning an officer to follow
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:31.940]   you around everywhere you go.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:34.940]   So we're just going to walk up and attach this to your car and we don't need a warrant.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.260]   There's no difference in following you.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:38.220]   Yeah, well, and first of all, it is.
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:41.500]   I mean, because by that logic, why not go ahead and throw one in every person?
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:44.620]   You know, the Supreme Court is hearing this right now, so we don't know what the court's
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:45.620]   going to do.
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:46.620]   Right.
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.300]   Because different courts, again, different courts have real differently on that one as
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.300]   well.
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:51.500]   Some say, you had no expectation of privacy when you're driving around.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.140]   They can stick something on your car if they want.
[01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.540]   There's no attaching something in your car that's your private property.
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:56.540]   They can't do that without a warrant.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:00.140]   You know what galls me about this is that if you spot the thing and take it and just
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:03.260]   keep it, you know, the device, they send you a bill.
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:05.780]   They come over and they demand it back and take it.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:06.780]   Absolutely.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:07.780]   Oh my God.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:08.780]   But you gave it to me.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:09.780]   That's what I say.
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.780]   You gave it to me.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:12.540]   You came in my house and gave me a gift.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:13.540]   A dog.
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:20.140]   So Justice Breyer said, well, the GPS one.
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.860]   In the GPS case, if you win this case, there's nothing to prevent the police or by the way,
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:26.460]   you cannot decide how a case is going to go from the questioning.
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:27.460]   I've learned.
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:28.460]   Of course.
[01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:31.020]   It's fascinating to listen to these these these back and forths that go on in the Supreme
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:32.020]   Court.
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:34.620]   But Breyer said, if you win this case, there's nothing to prevent the police or government
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:37.100]   from monitoring 24 hours a day.
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:38.500]   Every citizen in the United States.
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:39.660]   Yeah, it's what they want to do.
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.420]   It makes the crime solving a lot easier.
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:42.420]   It does.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:43.420]   I mean, that and that's the thing.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.420]   They're really out there.
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:45.420]   They're lazy.
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:46.420]   They're lazy.
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.420]   Honestly believe, you know what?
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:49.620]   We need this to catch the bad guys because the bad guys have the advantage and they're
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:50.620]   right.
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:54.340]   The question is, do we release our rights in order to catch some bad guys?
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:55.340]   Never.
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:57.140]   Ben Franklin was very clear about that.
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:00.180]   Train a little bit of liberty for security.
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:01.340]   You'll receive neither.
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:06.540]   Chief Justice Roberts, not the most liberal member of the court, wondered whether the
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:08.060]   government's I love this.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:12.540]   He asked the government attorney, is it your position that you could secretly attach GPS
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:17.820]   devices to the cars of, let's say, the nine members of the Supreme Court without a warrant?
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:21.180]   Well, this is also the supreme, you know, I mean, how long ago was it that the Supreme
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.420]   Court was like, yeah, you can take private property to increase the tax revenues of the
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:29.100]   county and, you know, use eminent domain to take property to increase the tax revenues
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.300]   of a city in Connecticut.
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:35.220]   And somebody would basically put together a brilliant idea about taking one of the Chief
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:39.500]   Justice's property in Vermont and turning it into a motel because it would increase the
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:44.900]   amount of, you know, what the, what the Supreme Court once done to them may or may not have
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:45.980]   anything to do with what the decision is.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:47.500]   I do think the argument is reasonable.
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:52.340]   They, uh, uh, uh, Justice Sotomayor said, well, could you put a computer chip in somebody's
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:53.340]   overcoat?
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.740]   And they said, no, you can't do that because that's going to go in their house.
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:43:00.100]   They say that the, that a car parked in the street, hey, buddy, slap.
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:02.020]   Yeah, but then they, then they might go in their house.
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:06.220]   So what they're saying is, no, no, we're just, they're saying a car parking garage does
[01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:10.260]   not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that we're only going to follow you where
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.860]   your car goes, which is essentially public thoroughfare.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:14.900]   And that's why I said they're not breaking into your garage.
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:15.900]   They're not going into your house.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:18.900]   They're saying that I could, I could still try to put you in there.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:19.900]   Trend.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.380]   Well, obviously we don't, besides that's going to be taken care of with the drones eventually
[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:24.820]   to be all over the place.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.780]   Take, you'll be one like hanging out here.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:27.780]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.660]   Are you crackpot or buzzkill?
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.500]   I'm sure I'm sorry.
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:32.500]   Just saying.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:33.500]   Okay.
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:34.500]   Black helicopters?
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.900]   No, just drones, drones, little ones.
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:37.900]   You don't, you need the big ones.
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:39.460]   You can have the ones that get the camera.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:41.020]   It can be right there.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:42.020]   60,000 feet.
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:44.860]   And by the way, if you're tracking your every movement, you know, just throw a net over
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:48.900]   them, quickly grab the GPS device, rip that out, take the antenna off, and then you have
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:50.900]   a nice little machine.
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:54.140]   There's parallels between this and the Twitter case, right?
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:55.940]   Because it's all about expectation of privacy.
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:56.940]   Expectation of privacy.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:00.780]   And the Twitter case, the expectation of privacy is like it's a direct message after
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:01.980]   log in to see it, right?
[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:05.460]   And the court said, no, you gave your IP address to Twitter.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:09.820]   And what they're asking for is that IP address and what they connected with it.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:12.980]   And when you gave that IP address to Twitter, you made it public because you gave it to
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:13.980]   a third party.
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:18.500]   So you no longer have expectation of privacy anymore because somebody else saw it.
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:22.100]   So you should know that since Twitter has it, other people might get it as well.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:24.900]   And the same thing here, your cars and your garage, I could have sat across the street
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:25.900]   and seen you drive your car.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:26.900]   I can finally arrive.
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:30.580]   You should have no expectation of privacy there because people from the outside can
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:31.780]   see your cars in the garage.
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:35.540]   I have to say, I don't disagree with their argument, but it does worry me that it's a
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:36.540]   slippery slope.
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:38.700]   It's a totally slippery slope.
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:40.940]   But the drones will be same thing.
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:41.940]   It doesn't matter.
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:45.100]   We have no expectation of privacy because we can fly a drone.
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:47.740]   Hey, I'm still going to have them over the border.
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.420]   I'm still thinking about the Patriot Act.
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:50.420]   Okay.
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:55.940]   It's a part of the Patriot will dish network become your next ISP dish network wants to
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:02.620]   deploy its hybrid satellite network using LTE, bringing broadband to every American within
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:05.220]   view of the dish satellite.
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:09.060]   They want to use the two gigahertz spectrum to do this.
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.060]   They own that.
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.060]   They own it.
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:16.900]   They've written a letter to the FCC asking for permission to do this.
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:18.700]   Isn't this like lights?
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:19.700]   What's the light?
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:21.660]   Light squared wants to do a wholesale version of this.
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:24.060]   I'm not sure if dish wants to do this wholesale or not.
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:26.140]   I hope they do because that's what we need.
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:30.460]   The biggest difference is light squared spectrum is right next to the GPS spectrum.
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:31.460]   Nobody's been using that.
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:35.260]   So the GPS industry has been bleeding over into the light squared spectrum for years.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:39.220]   And now that light squared wants to use it, the GPS industry is squealing that it causes
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:40.220]   interference.
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:41.660]   So light squared and it does.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:47.340]   So light squared say, we'll use half of the spectrum and then that'll make it easier
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.740]   for you to adapt to us using it.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:52.620]   The nice thing about dishes, they're using spectrum that doesn't interfere with anybody.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:53.620]   It's way up to eager.
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:54.620]   But what we need is this.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:59.020]   We need somebody providing satellite based LTE with sprint on the ground doing repeaters,
[01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:02.500]   which print is contract with light squared, doing wholesale dumb pipes.
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:04.940]   We need a business that says, what do you want to be the dumb side?
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:06.860]   Somebody get Tom on the board of directors.
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:07.860]   What about latency though?
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.740]   I mean, aren't we going to have latency with up links?
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:12.620]   Yeah, you want to have the latency because you've got the ground repeater station.
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:13.620]   So that solves the latency.
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:15.300]   The sprint is ready to do this for light squared.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:17.700]   I don't see why they wouldn't do it for dish two.
[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:19.420]   What it does is it increases coverage.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.420]   I love this.
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:21.420]   It seems that he's been on this.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.420]   He's been fine.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.420]   See, this is why.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.180]   This is the solution to net neutrality.
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:27.620]   We get a couple of people providing a wholesale dumb pipe.
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:28.620]   Competition.
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:31.740]   You can have a hundred million ISPs out there and you get to pick an ISP instead of having
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:32.740]   to have the FCC.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:36.860]   So their plan is when you say dumb pipe, their plan is to let many companies use it.
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:37.860]   They're just going to do infrastructure.
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:39.580]   We're just going to charge by the bandwidth.
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:40.780]   You can do whatever you want on it.
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:42.020]   This is fantastic.
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:43.020]   So let's make this happen.
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:44.020]   It might be a real.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.340]   Because light squared, I mean, light squared is getting kicked in the teeth by the FCC
[01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:51.300]   and it like, save our GPS has been beating on light squared with a stick.
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:53.140]   So this solves the problem?
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:58.180]   No, it means there's going to be solving the problems having two organizations competing
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:46:59.180]   for my business.
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:00.180]   Right.
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:02.580]   Having one organization that can blanket, you know, the same.
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:07.420]   Well, but I think Tom's point is if they sell it as wholesale bit, then we'll have multiple
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:10.460]   internet service providers floating on top of it, which will give us copies.
[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.940]   Ideally, you'd have multiple wholesalers.
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:12.940]   Absolutely.
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:15.980]   But one wholesaler is better than no wholesalers, which is what we got now.
[01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:19.740]   And you can see the hands of the carriers feeding that save GPS move.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:22.300]   Because they want to be light squared into a pole.
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:23.300]   You bet.
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:24.300]   Absolutely.
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.300]   That's a good story.
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:26.300]   We'll follow that.
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:27.840]   And that's one of the reasons that I think it's great to watch TNT Monday through Friday
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.660]   because Tom really keeps up on these stories, unlike me.
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:31.660]   And he has the answer.
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:36.340]   He understands these subjects, unlike me, and brings some real gravitas and depth to
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:38.220]   the enterprise, unlike me.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:41.780]   So TNT, 230, he's going to replace me.
[01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:42.780]   230 to 330.
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.620]   He doesn't have the voice.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:45.620]   No.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:47.060]   In fact, all I have is the voice.
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.540]   Yeah, but that the voice is--
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:49.780]   Well, the voice goes a long way.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:50.780]   It's finally hypnotic.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:51.780]   And it is hypnotic.
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.100]   And 1% of the voice is not--
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:54.100]   And my boyish--
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.100]   My boyish good looks.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:56.100]   Well, the voice anyway.
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.100]   That's true.
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:48:00.500]   And the fact that I have a GPS in your garage.
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.500]   Yeah, it's so what?
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:03.500]   I don't go anywhere.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:06.580]   I want to thank this fabulous panel starting with John C. Devorak.
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:07.580]   We didn't expect him.
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:09.180]   We didn't want him, but he came anyway.
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:11.340]   I don't put him much in.
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.340]   No.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:15.100]   We love John C. And he's the greatest.
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:16.100]   We love John.
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:17.100]   And that's so good to have you.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:18.100]   Channeldevorak.com.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:21.300]   And don't forget in the morning, it's noagendocheau.com.
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:22.860]   Those are-- I think that's awesome.
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:24.820]   I wish I could credit whoever made those deck of cards.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:26.620]   We'll give him credit on the Noagendocheau.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.340]   I know he had noagendocheau.com.
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:30.860]   Yeah, I just appeared in my mailbox one day.
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:33.100]   And maybe they said it to me, thinking I would give it to you.
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:37.140]   We do-- I often get mail because they saying, would you give this to John?
[01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:38.900]   Like I see you all the time or something.
[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:39.900]   Well, you do.
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:40.900]   You see me one day every while.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:41.900]   We're well--
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:42.900]   Usually unexpected.
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:44.700]   And Eileen would do store the mail.
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:45.900]   And she'll store it for you.
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:46.900]   Store it forward.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:47.900]   Oh, oh.
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:48.900]   She was with store it.
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:49.900]   I'll help you.
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:50.900]   And for a Rivera, we call her.
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:51.900]   John is the best.
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:52.900]   Great to have you.
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.500]   We didn't get you a bottle of wine, but we'll pick one out and you can have it on the
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.500]   way.
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:56.500]   OK.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:57.500]   All right.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:58.500]   Also, Patrick Norton, love having you.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:48:59.500]   Take as much black coffee as you want.
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:00.500]   It's all yours.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.300]   Patrick, of course, the host of "Texilla."
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:04.300]   It's a beautiful Veronica Belmont who is getting ready.
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:05.300]   It's getting ready.
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:06.300]   Look at that.
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:07.300]   Look at that.
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:08.300]   Oh.
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:10.700]   So you realize, real quick, real quick, Veronica, can you come on screen for just like--
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:11.700]   Is that real?
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.700]   Look at this great t-shirt she's wearing first of all.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.180]   We were shooting-- I love this t-shirt.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.380]   We were shooting scam school and Patrick made it out.
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:21.500]   And I realized that now that you guys have been co-host for years and now we're co-hosts,
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.500]   like we're now co-hosts in law.
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:24.500]   Me and me and me and me and me and me and me.
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:25.500]   Oh, so--
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:28.820]   That's much better than you said that I was like, what?
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:29.980]   Notice where she's standing, though.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:30.980]   I just want to point out.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:32.980]   Well, I haven't worked on my relationship with--
[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:33.980]   No, that's not true.
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:35.980]   You have to get-- you have to slowly worry about it.
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:36.980]   You're getting to know each other.
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:37.980]   It's very--
[01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:38.980]   Patrick of Veronica, the host of "Texilla."
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:39.980]   It is a great show.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:41.980]   "Texilla.com" T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.
[01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:42.980]   You must--
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:43.980]   John, why?
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:44.980]   I'm so sorry.
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:46.980]   Yeah, Tom Merritt, I already gave you a plug.
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:47.980]   Oh, wait, you know what?
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.980]   Tom does a great show with Veronica called "Swarden Laser Pointer."
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:54.980]   And I just love that.
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:56.980]   Swarden Laser Pointer?
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:57.980]   That's right.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:49:58.980]   I didn't even think about this.
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:49:59.980]   And it's just--
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:00.980]   It shows that this woman do.
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:02.980]   How many shows do you do?
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:03.980]   You do a lot of shows.
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:04.980]   Three now.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:05.980]   We cut back.
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:08.980]   So you're going to do Game On, "Sword and Laser."
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:09.980]   Yeah.
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:10.980]   And "Texilla."
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:11.980]   That's great.
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:12.980]   But "Texilla" is a big show.
[01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:14.980]   So that's a lot of work.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:17.980]   And so, Tom, you're also co-hosting law.
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:18.980]   With--
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:19.980]   With--
[01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:20.980]   Well, and--
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:21.980]   And the answer to you.
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:22.980]   Run, run.
[01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:23.980]   Exactly what I said.
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:24.980]   This is crude.
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:25.980]   You're crying.
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:26.980]   Because if you get out of town as fast as you can.
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.980]   Now, they don't do Top 5 at Revision 3 anymore.
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:30.980]   No, that has been put on height.
[01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:31.980]   That's a shame.
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:32.980]   Because I like that shit.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:35.980]   But you are doing something great, which is this news in "Tex."
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:36.980]   This news in "Tex."
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:37.980]   This news in "Tex" today.
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:38.980]   This is "Texilla" today?
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:39.980]   The "Tex" history today.
[01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:40.980]   Thank you.
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:41.980]   You know that's on "Twit."
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:42.980]   What?
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:43.980]   Really?
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:44.980]   Why don't we start that?
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:45.980]   No, we love that show.
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:47.980]   And you can watch it on YouTube, but you can also subscribe if you want to give it every day.
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:52.980]   Yeah, twit.tv/thtlinfoo is the editor, does a great job illustrating it.
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:53.980]   So watch the video version.
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:54.980]   I didn't know Lynn edited that.
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:55.980]   Well done.
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:58.980]   And she's got a sense for putting the right stuff up there to go along with it.
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:02.980]   She is, you know, she is a what we call a utility player because she also planned this barbecue.
[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:03.980]   I know.
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:05.980]   And didn't she do a great job putting us together?
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:07.980]   Thank you everybody for coming to the barbecue.
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:08.980]   We really appreciate it.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:14.980]   Brian Brushwood and Veronica Belmont are going to do our first run-through of Game on a brand new show.
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:15.980]   We're going to do that in just a few minutes.
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:17.980]   So please stick around if you can.
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:21.980]   And I guess all that remains is for me to say that we do this show every Sunday, 3 p.m.
[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:24.980]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:27.980]   That would be 2300 UTC at twit.tv.
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:28.980]   Please tune in.
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:31.980]   You can watch us live and be in the chat room when we talk back to you.
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:34.980]   Or if you miss it, you get a copy of it at twit.tv.
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:37.980]   We offer all our shows an audio and high quality video.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.980]   Are we going to do an HD version of this week as well?
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:41.980]   I believe so.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:47.980]   We did our first 720p download of last week's episode with Barrett on day and Nick,
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:51.980]   and Nick, and Joshua, and it was a great show to start with.
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:55.980]   It was a great show in general, but it looked so good.
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:58.980]   So if you haven't seen that download that one, and I guess we'll do this one in 720p.
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:00.980]   Is that the plan from now on?
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:06.980]   Yeah, wow, it's right because I've got to tell you, the size is 1.6 gigabytes.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:08.980]   And I'm a little nervous about the bandwidth.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:10.980]   That's why we want to talk to the folks at BitTorrent.
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:15.980]   I think at some point we'll set up a BitTorrent tracker and server and do this on BitTorrent as well.
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:17.980]   That way we don't have to worry about the file size.
[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:19.980]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:20.980]   We really appreciate it.
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.980]   Don't forget we are going to take the week after Christmas off,
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:26.980]   and we invite you to pick the best moments from the years, Twits,
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:30.980]   or any of our shows by going to twit.tv/bestof.
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:34.980]   You don't have to know the time code or just, you know, just say that moment where...
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:37.980]   Yeah, it will help if the more you give us the better.
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:39.980]   If you want to see it in the show, find the time code.
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:42.980]   Lin Fooka only do so much, my friends.
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:45.980]   Twit.tv/bestof. Thanks for joining us.
[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:46.980]   We'll see you next week.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:48.980]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:49.980]   Thank you everybody.
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.980]   [applause]
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:53.980]   This is wonderful show.
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:56.980]   [music]
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:57.980]   Do it the Twit.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:58.980]   Do it the Twit.
[01:52:58.980 --> 01:52:59.980]   All right.
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:00.980]   Do it the Twit, baby.
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:01.980]   Do it the Twit.
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:02.980]   All right.
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:03.980]   Do it the Twit.
