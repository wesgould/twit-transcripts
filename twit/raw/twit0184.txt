[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   >> I'm going to be streaming live from the world.

[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   >> I'm going to be streaming live from the world.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   >> I'm going to be streaming live from the world.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> I'm going to be streaming live from the world.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> I'm going to be streaming live from the world.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   >> We already had some at the end of last year.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Newspapers are trying to get their staffs and their operations down to meet their revenues,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   which are declining.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   The print revenues are dropping because of the economy and other factors.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   The web revenues aren't going fast enough to meet them.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Although growth is pretty good on the web.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   It's a real sticky situation and a tough time to be in the business.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> What's killing the newspapers?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   >> I think it's a variety of things.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I think kind of the economic seesaw that I've been doing with the cost of the web versus print ads that just doesn't make up for it.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Print ads are a rarity.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   They're few and far between because of space.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But on the web they're a commodity.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You just can't charge as much for them.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   So far what we've been trying to do is generate as many page views as you can to put ads on them.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But the value that causes the value of the ads to go further down.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Of course, in an intense economic recession, I like to call it an economic test or act.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   >> By the way, for those of you who don't know, a fourth dimensional cube.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   >> That's right. And the reference actually that I like is from Madeline Lingals.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> A real time.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   >> A real time.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Because it kind of feels like we're going back in time through this fourth dimensional cube.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   >> So I think it's economically speaking.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   >> Is it no coincidence or is it a coincidence that the Kindle 2 came out this week?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   John, do you think that that's part of what's going on?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   >> Nah.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   >> Nah.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   >> The fact of the matter is the newspapers have been in a slide since the advent of TV news.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It's been a slow decline and it was accelerated only recently.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   But they were sliding years ago before the web.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And then now what the web has done is it pointed out a couple of things in my opinion that are a problem.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   One, I think the newspapers aren't providing a quality product to their readers.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And in fact, if I was looking at the Rocky Mountain News site right now, and they have their covers all online.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And I'm looking at these covers and they suck.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I don't see any reason I'd buy this newspaper.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It was on a new stand.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Only one of these covers are interesting.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But the rest of them are just like boring.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   >> It was a tabloid paper, right?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It was the- >> Yeah.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   >> There were two papers in Denver.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So, I mean, I don't think there's any markets except New York City where you could support more than one newspaper, can you?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   >> I think they would all- it's always possible, but not when these papers are so dull that nobody cares.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But anyway, let me bring up a couple of interesting factors besides the fact that the papers are crappy product.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And of course, then they cheapen them as they have to do cutbacks.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   They don't put more money into them.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   They take money out of them, which makes it worse.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   But it seems to me that what's always been overlooked and what I think the web managed to point out to everybody is the redundancy of news.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I mean, if you're a newspaper and all you do is run AP stories and stuff that you've syndicated from the New York Times or even your own syndicate.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And everybody in their sister that's in the syndicate runs the same stories.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And if you go on the internet, you see nothing but redundancy, you say, "Why do we need all these newspapers for?"
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I think there's just too many.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   There really only needs to be a few national newspapers and some local newspapers.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And these kind of quasi-national papers, which would include the Houston Chronicle, which really only sell into a small and moderate sized area.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I think they're all toast.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   The Chronicle has 330,000 subscribers, the 12th largest newspaper in the country.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Is it gone?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   The Chronicle?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Who's not Houston, San Francisco?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It's toast.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It's toast.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Which means San Francisco will not have a daily paper.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Well, it's still...
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   They've got a couple of these free ones.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   The examiners still.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   The free ones.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   The free ones.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Great.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Well, the one thing that's happening in San Francisco is that the Hearst has told the unions that it wants serious concessions.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And is talking about some serious cuts in terms of staffing.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And they have to get to a certain amount before they can achieve it.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   They have said they will close it if they can't get to that.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   But it's also interesting to look at what's happening in Seattle, where it looks like they're going to go with an online only version.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And I am not in the loop in terms of Hearst's corporate.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I don't know anything more than kind of what you read in the newspapers.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   That's ironic.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Or on a blog.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Or on the blog.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   But I'm really intrigued by what's happening in Seattle.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I was kind of hoping that would happen a long time ago.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I think Seattle has an opportunity to be a real test bed for an online only newspaper with that.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   When a brand is primarily promoted by a website as opposed to print.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And I wish that Hearst would do that in San Francisco.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   But I don't know that the economics are there in that paper.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Denise, you're in beautiful Indian Wells with your husband.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   You're enjoying a beautiful Sunday.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Did you sit down to brunch with the Sunday Times and take hours leisurely reading it?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   No, not brunch.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   But we do get the paper every day.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I love my Sunday paper.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Yeah, and we'll go out and get it if it's not delivered to the house.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   That's mostly driven by my husband.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I'm a paper reader because it's Hearst.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   We subscribe to the local small town paper, The Argus Courier, which comes out on a Wednesday.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   It's owned by Times Corporation.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   We subscribe to the Sunday Times and we subscribe to the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And on my Kindle, I subscribe to all the same stuff, including plus the New Yorker, Atlantic,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   and the salon.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Have you gotten, do you like reading it on the Kindle as opposed to reading a paper?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   No.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And you know what?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   This is where it's calling me.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I love the Kindle.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I'm very happy with the Kindle for reading books.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   But it is not a satisfying experience for reading a newspaper.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Why is that?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It's, you know, there's something about browsing a paper that is a very different aesthetic
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   experience from reading sequentially page after page on a book.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   A paper is meant to browse.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I think images are important.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I think scanning is important.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   The physical tactical side of it.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So you're not, Denise, you're not one of those people who feels, I just, I thought that maybe
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   you were a Sunday paper kind of person.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I am a Sunday paper kind of person, but only because somebody else is going to the
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   effort of pointing it in front of the, yeah, I mean, and we subscribe to the paper at home.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.200]   I'm looking forward, actually, to getting the new Kindle because one of the papers that's
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.000]   going to be on there is the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And I just, like you said, I don't get, I don't regularly go and check out SFgate.com.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   No, it's not the same.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I used to live in the Bay Area and I do miss that paper.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Just it has a unique flavor all its own.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And I'm looking forward to getting it on the Kindle.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So I'm kind of hoping that it's a better experience than reading it on the web.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   One of the things about the Kindle and newspapers is that what you're getting is part of the
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Morning Edition.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   In other words, not everything.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   It isn't the whole thing, is it?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   No.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And it's only delivered once.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   You know, what kind of irritates me about newspapers on the Kindle is that they don't
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   update the news during the day.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I think it would be really cool to have a device that you could carry around with you where,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   just like on the web, you got breaking news, you got things that were happening during
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   the day.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I think that's an opportunity lost on the Kindle.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I have a device like that.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   What's that?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   It's called my iPhone.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   iPhone is an amazing device for getting breaking news.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I've been kind of running around our newsroom and talking to our managers and yelling that
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   we should be doing a lot more on the iPhone.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   It's not just the iPhone that you can get breaking news on.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.200]   Well, no, but I'm talking about just smartphones.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   I think mobile.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   Because it's mobile.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   Yeah, because it's mobile.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   I think that makes sense.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.000]   I think it's the last night that I won an eye findle.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   An eye findle.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.560]   Well, now one of the stories that did circulate when the Kindle 2 came out was that maybe
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.240]   Amazon would be releasing this format and making, for instance, an iPhone application
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   possible.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.000]   I don't think the form factor of the iPhone is really as easy to read.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   You might be ironic.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   You might be right.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Do I?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   The iPhone is better for reading a newspaper and the Kindle is better for reading a book.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   For breaking news.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.320]   I find that I got into the habit of doing it going through the New York Times on my iPhone
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320]   when I was in San Francisco.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   Time table.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.320]   And I'm a very nice client for that.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   I didn't use the client.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   I actually used their web page.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   Really?
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.120]   And I took the cable card to work.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.560]   And so it was really a pain in the neck to open a newspaper because it would blow and
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.280]   it would be hard to keep track of it while I was reading it.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.880]   And once I got used to it, I got to a point where that's actually what broke me away
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   from ever going back to the paper was I got used to having this little box that had all
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880]   my text in it.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.640]   And it was much easier to eat your breakfast and read the New York Times on my iPhone than
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.840]   it was using a newspaper.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:30.640]   Well, there's also some sort of a green irony here.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.800]   The newspapers have largely promoted the idea of conservation and going green and all
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   the rest of it.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.600]   Look at surveys about why people stop subscribing to newspapers.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.760]   A lot of it has to do with the fact that they don't like to waste all that paper.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.760]   I admit it.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.960]   I feel really guilty and we recently.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   New York Times.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   70,000 trees a week.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   Oh my God.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.520]   I mean, I feel guilty when I see that big stack of paper.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.960]   And the truth is the other reason you feel guilty is you only read a fraction of what
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   that paper represents.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960]   So it really is waste.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   Right.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.760]   And the Sunday paper, I mean, for all the good stuff that comes from sitting down with
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.280]   the Sunday paper, all the advertising that you have to throw away when you have that paper
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.280]   is just disgusting.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.160]   Well, that's how they were making their living.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.080]   I'm going to submit that there's really three things that killed the daily paper.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.080]   Ink, paper, and Craig Newmark.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:24.280]   I mean, if you don't have Craig's list, isn't, do I have my wrong on the economics of newspapers?
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.000]   But wasn't the classified ad what kept newspapers alive?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.840]   And without that, can they survive?
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.640]   There's a real interesting illustration of that.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   You're right.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.920]   The kind of rust belt was falling apart.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.680]   People were moving to the south.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:46.400]   The Houston Chronicle and the Houston Post's classified sections were incredibly fat and
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   happy.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.760]   And people used to sell them on the streets of Detroit and other rust belt cities, just
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.720]   the classified sections because they had the ads for Houston in them.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.640]   And we had a huge influx of people coming down in that era into Houston from Michigan
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.440]   and the rust belt.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.840]   But what ultimately has happened is, yes, that the internet, I wouldn't say just Craig's
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   list.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.600]   I think Craig's list had a real impact in San Francisco, less so in other parts of the country.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.760]   But the internet in general in ways of being able to distribute goods, including eBay, I
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:25.000]   think wound up cutting into classifieds terribly.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And it's now very thin.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.800]   I mean, you look at the classified section in our paper now versus what it was in its
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.720]   heyday in the 70s and it's just astonishing.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   What about--
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.400]   There were putting too many eggs in that classified basket.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   Let's face it.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   Oh, yes, I agree.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   I agree.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.680]   What about really the bigger issue, which is news gathering, they're all saying we can't
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.920]   afford the big newsroom.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.480]   But you look at Drudge, you even look at the Huffington Post.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:01.440]   And mostly what they do these days is aggregate mainstream media.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.000]   They're not doing much journalism on their own.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.680]   If you get rid of the newsrooms, if you get rid of the investigative reporters, don't
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.040]   we as a democracy suffer as well.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.760]   When I say we are the US, but worldwide doesn't the world suffer without a free press?
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   I think it's already suffered.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.360]   Look, look, look, people have already talked about the foreign, all the foreign correspondents
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   are all gone.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   They've been gone for decades.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   They've pulled them.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.640]   And they don't have resources for these investigative reports.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.120]   They were living in a dream world if we think this stuff even exists anymore.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.000]   Now it's just redoing associated press stories, Reuters, whatever else you have.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   That's a good point.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.120]   They've just taken the feeds.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.120]   So is it Reuters?
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.440]   It's got the big newsroom?
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.800]   Reuters does have a big newsroom.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   Maybe that's the solution.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.200]   Denise, what were you going to say there?
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.520]   I'm going to say, you know, I think of it as kind of parallel to the music industry.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.240]   The impulse to do journalism certainly hasn't gone away.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.600]   The impulse to be a creative musician.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.320]   But the business models are all in flux and the old ones are falling apart and the new
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.480]   ones are being figured out.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.280]   And what I was going to say about the Huffington Post, for example, that's interesting is they
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:15.800]   do give a forum for some unique individual voices that you wouldn't see in mainstream
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   media.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   True.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.360]   You have Estradysen reporting in for the face camp in Russia.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.360]   Right.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.080]   And I think that I completely agree.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:45.520]   I think that the issue is that you are going to end up with less of a professional class
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.080]   of journalists that are more syndicated.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.960]   So there's less writers writing about the same thing right now.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.640]   Where do Woodward and Bernstein come from in the future?
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.000]   Who's going to pay for that?
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.960]   Well, I think that you're still going to have national brands of people who are writing
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:12.040]   that are going to end up exposed to a lot of markets because the markets will be, you
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:17.400]   know, I think that having a local reporter reporting on national or international news
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.680]   will become less and less common because it doesn't, you just don't have the money to
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   do that.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.520]   But I also think that you're going to continue to have this exploding, you know, blogosphere
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.880]   where people are able to put stuff up that isn't necessarily as refined.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.320]   But you know, this is the same thing we hear every time there's a revolution.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.320]   Like everything turns over.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.320]   It's disruptive.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.000]   When I was working at a cable network learning how to do pre-press, you know, learning how
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.800]   to do computer, and I've said this before, that the art directors were lamenting these
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:51.360]   interns that were getting paid for 15-hour and taking away their work, you know, and
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.840]   that the art direction was going to go, you know, to hell in a hand basket because of
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840]   all of this.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.520]   And, you know, it was bad for a couple of years as people figured all of that out.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.880]   But then something else came up and replaced it.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.760]   And I think that we're going to see that happen again.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   I don't know exactly how long it'll take, but that it's exactly the same thing.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.200]   I wanted to take exception to something John said about local investigative reporting.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.680]   I think that's still being done in a lot of markets.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:27.200]   Last week we had a federal judge plead guilty to charges of sexual harassment of his staff
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.000]   as a result of stories that we had done in our paper.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.200]   And that stories like that are being done at, you know, in major cities and newspapers
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   all the time.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.560]   The Rocky Mountain News was known for that kind of thing.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.160]   So I think that that type of journalism is still going on.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   I think it is.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.840]   Well, who's going to do it in Denver?
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.560]   Well, in Denver, you know, there's the Denver Post.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   That's it.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.200]   There, reputation is right.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.720]   But that's more than zero.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   One more than zero.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   It's close to zero.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   Close to zero.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:02.360]   And I think that, you know, one of the things that we're doing at the Chronicle is we are
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.520]   trying to provide a platform for the community to cover itself.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.920]   We allow people to set up blogs and we have recruited people to write about kind of their
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   niches.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.560]   That's not investigative reporting.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   But I think that the future of newspapers is to kind of find a way to let the community
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.120]   tell its story.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:28.720]   Our traditional past mission has been to go out, get information, compile it, make it
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.240]   understandable, and then present it to people.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.040]   And I think now what we have to do is kind of go on to the web, go to where people are
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:42.120]   talking and writing about themselves and doing video about themselves, organize that,
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:47.200]   compile it and make it understandable to the community, help the community cover itself.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.640]   That's the way I think that we can, in the long term, go in and provide the coverage
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.360]   that people want in a city from a newspaper.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.960]   So Dwight, what are you going to do after the Houston Chronicle folds?
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.160]   You're going to write a blog?
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.000]   I don't think that the Houston Chronicle is going to fold.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.120]   You're in relatively good shape compared to the rest of the country.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:15.680]   But yeah, I mean if tomorrow I had no newspaper, I owned Dwight Silverman.com and I have a
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.320]   few other catchy little domains that I'm thinking about.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.880]   And I would throw up a blog and just go after it.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.160]   I think now's the time, Dwight.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.240]   I mean, would the Chronicle let you do that?
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.120]   Would it let you pursue that?
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   Not independently.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.200]   And having the Chronicles brand behind me is pretty powerful.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.360]   I make a phone call, I get it returned.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   That's kind of the best.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:42.400]   I just use as a model what I did because I've been through media set downsizing.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.760]   And at every stage, I think it's really great if you could transfer the brand to the new
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.840]   media before the old media disappears.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.200]   Just from my own experience, it's a very useful thing to do.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.120]   Well, probably one of the best examples of that recently is Harry McCracken.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.440]   It's just a technologist.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.120]   He started that from scratch and he was still in PC World when he did too, wasn't he?
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.120]   Or no, he had already left.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.120]   He had left.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.120]   He had left.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.960]   He kind of disappeared for a little while and then he came forth.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.200]   I talked to him about it at CES and I think he's making a go of it.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:21.480]   What's funny is the same day that he quit from PC World, he closed on a new house.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   Oh, he started.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.480]   That's brave.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   That's a leap of faith.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   That's brave.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.720]   And so, you know, he, I think it shows that you can still do it.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   I want to take a break.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.080]   You know, her, one of the things that's happened is that Hearst has announced its own Kindle.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.360]   I want to talk about the prospects for that.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   Also about Kindle too.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.360]   I've got one here.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.680]   I'll play you the voice.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.800]   But before we do that, I want to mention a brand new sponsor on the show and really
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   welcome them.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.960]   I, I'm actually thrilled to have these guys on board.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.480]   It's a company called Squarespace@squarespace.com.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.600]   I know you know about them, Alex.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.600]   It's kind of funny because Alex and I both looked at this independently and I am blown
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.600]   away.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.520]   I would say it really is the next generation in a lot of ways of blogging.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.520]   It's hosted.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.080]   It does the host fully hosted.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.720]   So you're not doing the geek stuff of installing software.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.720]   You're not, but boy, you get a really great functionality.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.800]   You get the ability to scale very well in case you get dug.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   Right.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.040]   And also you get, you are able to, there's tons of widgets that are prebuilt and there's
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040]   no code.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.880]   It's not like, oh, I got to cut and paste some code over.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.640]   It's literally, I just, I open up my template.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.640]   I drag stuff in.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.160]   I want to have, I want to make sure that this, this thing is a bit orderable by Amazon.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.360]   I can input my affiliate.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.600]   I can, you know, add things to dig me.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.080]   I can add all that stuff, all the things you would normally want on a blog are all just
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   kind of built into it.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.280]   I went, I did some research because we almost went with it with Twip and then Scott had,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   you know, his own people.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   He had his own thing.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   But he had his own capacity.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.040]   You know, as somebody who has run now a bunch of my own WordPress blogs, we are moving
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.600]   the corporate blog over to it.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.720]   I'm looking at moving Leo, Villover to it.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.440]   There's a real advantage to not doing it yourself.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.440]   They've got a server.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   Okay.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.440]   Let me interjections.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   We're plugging this guy.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.000]   One of the things, I think people should know out there is it actually employs a kind
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.480]   of dynamic CSS.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   It's very cool.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   Which is very interesting to play with.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.040]   Instead of having it run and you can import your own code if you want to.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   Next.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.040]   It's not like it keeps you locked out.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.600]   But it's got this, this dynamic CSS is quite fascinating.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   I've never seen anything, I've never seen anything work as well as this is a Wizzie
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   wig design.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.520]   It's quite, quite unique.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.400]   And on the fly while you're live.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.440]   You can, let's say you decide, I don't want that column to be so wide.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   You drag it.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.000]   I mean, it's really, these guys are doing some very, it's a Yahoo interface builder.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.560]   I asked a little bit about the underlying technology.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:44.800]   They're doing some very interesting JVM stuff, some virtualizing in the servers so that they
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.440]   can throw more servers in place and it spreads the load balances across all the sites.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.240]   It's huge value to using people who are using state of the art technology as your back end.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.320]   I mean, I like having my own back end.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.720]   I like having the root log in, but I got to tell you, I've kind of learned my lesson.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.560]   We found out today that we were off offline for eight hours.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.520]   My blog was offline for eight hours because somebody at the server had kicked an ethernet
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.000]   cable loose.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.480]   So square, square space sounding better and better.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   Take a look at it.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   You can try it for two weeks and get 10% off if you decide to stick around your new account
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.480]   at squarespace.com/twit.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.760]   I'm going to tell you the most important thing to you and certainly when you're doing the
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:37.320]   trial, it will automatically import WordPress blogger, moveable type, type pad and export
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   it.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.560]   And I was so impressed by this.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.720]   It is not, you know, one of those roach motel sites where you get your data in, you can
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.880]   never get to that again, they have from day one had complete data portability in and out.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.440]   If you're a photographer, this is why TwiPSHOD had used it, the photo gallery templates,
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:59.400]   unbelievable, incredible templates, widgets for Google Maps, built in search engine optimization,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.800]   website tracking permissions.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.520]   That's why we're going to use it because we're going to have multiple editors.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.680]   The cloud architecture is just mind blowing.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.440]   You're going to hear more about them on the Twitch shows.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.280]   I've just become a really big fan of this.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.440]   And if you're looking at a place to host your blog to do a blog that looks gorgeous, easily,
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.720]   quickly and affordably squarespace.com/twit.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.320]   And we thank them so much for becoming part of the TwiPSHOD family.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:32.720]   These are, I talked for a long time to Anthony and Dane who are the two of the guys behind
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   it.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   And it's really cool.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   You know, they're young guys.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.880]   It's really, it's really kind of neat what's going on out there.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:43.560]   All right, let's talk about, I have a feeling I can almost guess John's reaction to the
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.960]   Hearst Corporation saying, "Well, we're going to do a Kindle ourselves."
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.960]   What do you think, John?
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   They have a shot at this?
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   Yes, my reaction.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   Why you ask?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   I just, it's idiotic.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   Okay, thank you.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.960]   I'm right.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.400]   It's fun to hear you say it, John.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.680]   It just sounds better coming out of John's mind.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.320]   Why not do their own?
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.960]   They're making it's going to be a larger format, right?
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.000]   Why are they spending their time on this sort of thing?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.560]   I mean, let's face it, if we go back to the argument that the content stinks in these
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.560]   newspapers and the things aren't compelling and they're not doing a very good job and
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.320]   they've cheapened the product and this and that and the other thing, what is going to,
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.160]   that's not going to change whether you have a Kindle like device or not.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.760]   And I don't think the typical newspaper reader, especially the ones who are still subscribers
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.840]   or really like what you say, Leo, and I'm in total agreement with this.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.200]   When you have a newspaper, you browse it in a funny kind of way that is very unique to
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.720]   newspapers.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.880]   This device is, you might as well just read the headlines on your iPhone.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.040]   It's the same thing, only bigger.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.960]   They say that while it's going to be black and white, because you're really stuck with
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.400]   the E-ink that black and white right now, they do want to go to high resolution color.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.320]   They want to do video.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   Now remember, Hearst doesn't just own newspapers.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.520]   They own a lot of magazines.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.200]   And also, the one thing to know is this isn't a Johnny come lately kind of reaction.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.720]   They invested in E-ink quite some time ago.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.240]   Oh, so this is their technology?
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.680]   Yeah, the technology that's being used is they over 10 years ago, they invested in E-ink.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   Oh, I didn't realize.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.600]   They've been playing this game for quite some time.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.680]   But they're a little late to the game.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.480]   I mean, Amazon's there.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   Sorry.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.160]   Well, I think that the thing that they're looking at also is that they are trying to
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.920]   be more flexible with the business model.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   You know, both Amazon and--
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.920]   They want to make an open device.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.920]   Right.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.560]   So basically, it allows-- they're going to allow magazine companies and newspaper companies
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.560]   to define how people pay for it, how they-- and so on and so forth, rather than taking
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.560]   Amazon and what will sure be an Apple reaction when Apple eventually does this, this is the
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.560]   way it gets done.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.960]   This is the way it gets distributed.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   Right.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   It's a loser.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.960]   It's a money loser.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.840]   It's going to be a big time.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.560]   You might as well just buy a yacht and throw money into it.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.160]   Denise, do you have a Kindle?
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160]   You have a Kindle, don't you?
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.760]   I ordered mine last night.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.760]   Aha.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.360]   So this would be your first Kindle?
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   Yes.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.360]   And what put you over the top?
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:06.680]   Both Ernie Spenson, who is a frequent guest on Twill and Robert Scobol gave the new version
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.880]   rave reviews and when they both liked something unbound to like it.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.920]   I'm going to go out on a limb.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:16.240]   I think this is the-- this is to publishing what the iPod was to the music industry.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.480]   I think it's actually-- the first one was not.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.200]   The first one was the Pontiac Aztec of reading devices.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.360]   This is elegant.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.360]   It's slim.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.160]   It's-- it solves a lot of the UI issue.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.640]   Alex, you're ziding it right now.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.440]   It solves a lot of the UI issues that I had with the first Kindle.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.080]   The page turn is faster.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.720]   You don't accidentally press buttons.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.000]   The screen isn't-- I can't.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   16 grades.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   You can't touch it.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And you do want to touch it, don't you?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Well, after you're trained by the iPhone, let me turn it on for you.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Touch it.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   You know, you're--
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I can't--
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   You want to hear the reading?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Would you like to hear the reading a little bit?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Sure.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   All right.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Let me--
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Will Wheaton's comparison.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   No, what did he say?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.240]   He-- you know, there was that whole thing that came out last week about whether they
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.600]   were going to be permitted to do the second--
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.640]   The author's guild made a stink, right?
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.160]   The moronic author's guild said, "You're going to kill our audio books."
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   Right.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   To which--
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.560]   Not to mention the fact that-- how are you going to kill the audio?
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.480]   You already bought the book.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   Right.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.840]   So Amazon caved on the fair use issue, which isn't surprising since fair use is basically
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.160]   just an invitation to litigate the issue.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.760]   I have a theory on this whole thing.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.960]   Let me play for you.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.040]   I'm going to-- I'm going to-- John, you're going to be muted for a minute.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:36.880]   I'm going to use your microphone to plug in Mr. Kindle and now ladies and gentlemen,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.400]   a dramatic reading from Masters of Doom.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.280]   The story-- this is the story of the id guys, John Carmack and George Romero.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.920]   How two guys-- something, something, something, something.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.520]   Dot, dot, dot, ellipsis.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   By the way, this is very slow.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.520]   I'm stalling.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.520]   Suspense.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.240]   Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.880]   Romero mimic these video game sounds the way other kids did celebrities.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   That's the female voice.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.680]   This was worth risking everything.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.160]   The crush of the meteors.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.120]   The theft of the paper route money.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.600]   The wrath of his stepfather.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.800]   Because no matter what Romero suffered, he could always escape back into the games.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.920]   At the moment, what he expected to suffer was a legendary whipping.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:22.040]   Now, I'm going to play the male voice, which I think is maybe marginally easier to understand.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.520]   But this is a computer voice.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.520]   There's no question.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.320]   Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.640]   Romero mimic these video game sounds the way other kids get celebrities.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.680]   Unlike this was worth risking everything.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.000]   The crush of the meteors.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.680]   The theft of the paper route money.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.160]   The wrath of his stepfather.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   So I guess--
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.720]   The male voice has more inflections.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.360]   There's still kind of a mechanistic inflection.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.920]   But there's some inflection to it.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:53.280]   So Will Wheaton did this interesting side-by-side test where his theory that he was positing,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.680]   and I think it's where you're going by playing this for us from the Kindle, is that there's
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.760]   just no comparison between a mechanized voice and a human voice.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.600]   So he read from his book, "Sunken Treasure."
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.560]   And then he had his max text-to-speech generator, which he was told was sort of like the Kindle.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.480]   It's actually a little better, but it's roughly the same.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.720]   Yeah, the Alex voice.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720]   Right.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.560]   And had that read.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.040]   And I got what he was saying, that certainly it's better to have a person read.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.760]   But the machine-read version wasn't bad.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.720]   And in a pinch, I would definitely do it.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:36.840]   And unfortunately, Amazon has sort of left us in that pinch because getting audiobooks
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.080]   onto the Kindle isn't all that easy, especially if you're on a Mac, right?
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   Because you have to--
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.320]   You have to use the Audible software, or I don't even know how you--
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   Right.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.040]   And I think on the Mac, I found an article it was from a year ago, so maybe this has
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:58.600]   updated since then, but it was on rexblog, groucing loudly about the fact that if you
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.920]   have a Mac, you're out of luck because the Audible software that works with the Kindle
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.160]   is key field.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.640]   Well, I got an iPod.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.800]   I really don't care about putting audiobooks on the Kindle, but which will kill the battery
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   life.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   In fact, reading kills the battery life.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.040]   Well, I think this is more like I'm reading a book, I have to get in the car, I'm going
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.560]   to turn on the audio so I can continue to kind of read along.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.240]   And I think that-- I think Amazon's issue right now is they can't afford to lose trajectory.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:28.840]   They need to like just be streamlined about launching this new application and not have
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.840]   a lot of hubbub.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.080]   I think one passive aggressive way they could handle this is to make sure that it's very
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.640]   clear when you're ordering a book from the Kindle that it's not audio-enabled.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640]   That's exactly--
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.080]   You get the nail on your head.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.040]   You're doing it passive aggressively.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040]   Here's my thesis.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:49.360]   First of all, within two days of the authors' guild, "Covetching" Amazon backstand and
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.080]   says-- and I know you appreciated this, Denise.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.360]   What we're doing is completely legal.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.480]   We are not in any way saying that they have any merit in their argument whatsoever.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.920]   We would win a lawsuit, but we're going to be nice guys and we're going to let each publisher
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.360]   mark their books not for text to speech if they should so choose.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.240]   Here's my passive aggressive theory on this.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.600]   How could they've done it in two days?
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.280]   They knew exactly what was going to happen.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.640]   Jeff Bezos played this like a perfectly played chess match.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.280]   He said, "They're going to bitch.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280]   Here's what we do.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   We go public.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   We let them bitch.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.920]   We make sure everybody hears them bitch."
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.600]   Then we say, "Okay, we'll be the nice guys.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.480]   We'll back off and now you're exactly right, Alex.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.840]   They're going to make it very clear when you buy a book.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.200]   This may not be read out loud and nobody's going to buy it."
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   I'll just skip right over it.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:43.040]   Would you really skip right over it because you couldn't listen to it?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.120]   Yeah, I don't really like to read.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.400]   Denise, they're right though.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.160]   There's no legal merit in the author guild's point of view.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.960]   Well, I guess that's where I was going a second ago.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.320]   You're into this fuzzy area of fair youth.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.400]   Will Wheaton's point was, "There's really no difference.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.960]   You're not taking away from the market for audiobooks because people are always going
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.280]   to want that human reader.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.840]   There's just no comparison."
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.080]   Actually, when I heard his side by side thing, I went, "No, I wouldn't mind having Alex so
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.080]   bought.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   Read me a book."
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   That's interesting.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:24.560]   The one thing that I will say is that we are, this is still, voice text to speech is still
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.720]   very early on.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:33.320]   That I can see five years down the road, 10 years down the road, getting to a point where
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.040]   I may not really care.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.200]   If it was a lot less expensive.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:41.720]   I only had to pay the reduced cost of the book and get the audio for free.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.280]   I can see where the authors are trying to draw a line.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.440]   But I think that they're going to lose this one.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.800]   As far as what you were saying a second ago, Leo, I think you're dead on that Amazon may
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.720]   have been pretty crafty in the way they did this.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.640]   Ray Beckerman, who's the RIAA versus the people lawyer, he represents a lot of the defendants
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.880]   in those cases, had a comment on Flash.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.560]   I don't know where he said Amazon showed this threat for what it was, extortion.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:13.520]   I think it was very, I think it was, if I were in a cricket audience, I would applaud politely
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.120]   and say, "Well played, well played Amazon."
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.880]   It was pretty clear that Jeff knew exactly what would I, how else would he have been
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.320]   able to say within two days, "Okay, we'll turn it off?"
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.480]   Yeah, they obviously had that capability already built into it to do it.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.560]   I don't know if I haven't seen any, has anybody seen any books yet that already have the audio
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   turned off?
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.720]   Has anybody spotted that?
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720]   Who has a Kindle?
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.880]   I've got a review Kindle in the one thing.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.560]   No, no, I haven't at all, no.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.560]   You don't see that.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   And what if you already have it?
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.880]   If you already have the book on your Kindle, I've got about four on the review unit they
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   sent me.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   Yeah, I guess there's nothing I could do that.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.880]   Well, they suddenly--
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.880]   You've got to be cramp-fathered in.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   You cramp-fathered in.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.360]   The one thing about the Kindle that bothers me still is the pricing.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.200]   I think it's still way too expensive to become a nice device.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.200]   Oh, I agree.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.120]   And it's about 199 or less in order, I think, to really take off.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:14.360]   And it's US only, which really-- now, that's because publishing is such a crazy quilt of
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.360]   national jurisdictions.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.720]   And I don't know if they'll ever solve that.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   We've learned that--
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.440]   And Leo, you mentioned earlier that they had-- that there was some hinting that they were
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.360]   going to do-- allow you to read it on your iPhone.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.800]   And in the initial announcement, when they were talking about the capability that the
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.640]   new Kindle has to kind of-- if you have two Kindles and you stop reading a book in one
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.440]   place, you pick up the other Kindle.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.440]   I love that.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.720]   They bitch an ore on other devices.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:45.280]   And I know that if I don't own a Kindle and there's an iPhone application that lets me
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.920]   do that, I will get the iPhone application and skip the hardware on the Kindle unless
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.880]   version three is just dramatically better and dramatically cheaper.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.080]   I'd read it on my iPhone.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.360]   John, would you ever buy a Kindle?
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.360]   No.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.920]   Why not buy anything anyway if you haven't noticed?
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:08.000]   Now, if I was going to buy it, I think it needs a $99 price point.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.480]   It's way-- well, I don't know about 99, but I think you're right.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   What's wrong with 99?
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   Well, I don't know.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.480]   I mean, I'm sure that-- I don't know.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.480]   Do you think it costs more than 99?
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.400]   And what do you think it costs to make this thing?
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.240]   Well, probably the way they're making it.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.480]   Obviously, what are they charging for?
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   They're $300.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.480]   $359.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.280]   Then it's probably costing them.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.480]   Bag of parts would probably be around $70, $80.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.120]   All right, then they could charge 99 because they're making the money off the bus.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.640]   They're not going to get money money.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.600]   They have to get the bag of parts down to $25.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.160]   But that means the screen mainly.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.600]   All right, so what about $150?
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.080]   I think that would be a sweet spot.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   All right.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   $99.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   There's your number.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   All right.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   Well, they're right now.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.920]   Well, they're comfortable to iPod price because Leo, you said a bit ago that you have
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.400]   your iPod for audiobooks.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:53.600]   I could see my Kindle replacing what I use my iPod for mostly, which is audiobooks and
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.600]   podcasts.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   Right.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   Right.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.160]   If I could, you know, that's sort of my legacy device I carry around with me right now is
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.640]   my old video iPod.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.520]   I have my iPhone, but I can't put all that stuff on it because the iPhone memory is too
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.520]   long.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520]   Right, it's only 16 years.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.480]   And plus it kills the battery on your phone.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   You know what then?
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:19.040]   The thing to me about both the Kindle and the iPhone is that there's kind of a tradition
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.520]   in electronics that they will, electronics makers will sometimes continue to sell an older
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.360]   version of something at a lower price.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.120]   They didn't do, Apple didn't do that with the original iPhone.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.320]   You know, they could have sold that for $150 and made it, you know, the older cheaper model.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.120]   And Amazon did not do that with the Kindle.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.160]   They could have continued to make kind of the bigger, clunkier one and sold that at, say,
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   $200.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.520]   Yeah, I'm surprised they didn't do that actually.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.160]   But you know, there was a real question whether there's any incentive for them to do a cut
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.000]   price anyway, since they can't seem to make enough to sell anyway.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.480]   Well, they also have to pay for the bandwidth because it rides over the cell phone network.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:07.400]   Don't you think they build that into the price of the book?
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   I would.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   If I'm into the hardware.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   Okay.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.600]   Because if I'm just the book or sheet, I would.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   But okay.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   So here's it.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.680]   So John, you probably better at this than I am.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:23.840]   But as I remember the normal cut that a book publisher takes from the bookstores 50%.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:29.560]   Well, it's between 40 and 60, depending on the book typically.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   Okay.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.120]   So that's presumably the same deal they make with Amazon.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:40.080]   So if Amazon is charging 50%, they need to charge a little more obviously than it's
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.640]   costing them for the book.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.200]   But the publishers don't have to kill a tree.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   They don't have to print it.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   They don't have to ship it.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.480]   So presumably the publishers are making a deal that is better than 40 to 60%.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.160]   Amazon's charging, you know, $10 for a best seller.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   What is that?
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.040]   That's, you know, $25 best seller.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:02.200]   What's overlooked in the formula is the fact that the authors are getting screwed in this
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   deal.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.960]   So the authors not make as much for an e-book?
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.560]   Well, I mean, if the book is selling for $10, which is what everybody wants these things
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.800]   to sell for, I mean, there's going to, there's even a protest movement right now to boycott
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.280]   any books on the Kindle that are more than $9.99.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.400]   And if you do a two way, you know, just a 50% split with a, with a, with a retailer.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:27.960]   So it's $5 essentially for the retail and $5 for the publisher.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.880]   And the typical royalty is 15% of whole.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.880]   Oh.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.960]   So the $10 of retail is going to be a buck or so when if they were doing a hardcover book,
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   they'd be making $5 a copy or sort of three, four, five bucks, something like that.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.000]   So they're, they're losing about one, two thirds of their income on these, on these
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   electronic books.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.560]   I'm sure authors aren't too happy about it.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:51.240]   That's probably one of the reasons the authors guild kind of made a fuss to just harass them.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:56.240]   Well, one question I have as far, I mean, in the long term is whether authors could
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.680]   possibly be empowered to publish directly.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.640]   I mean, what do they need a publisher for when they're not having to send a book over to
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.200]   China anymore?
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   That's a good point.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   Why not just publish?
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.400]   Especially if you're an established, if you're Stephen King or you're someone like that,
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.720]   why would you, why do you need no, it's like, you don't.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   That's the joke of it.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:20.480]   In fact, there should be some way of directly just a writer should be able to put together
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:26.080]   his own book and then sell it directly to the Kindle for 9.95 and take the entire 9.95
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.800]   and put it in his pocket.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.600]   And I think that's absolutely where the things are going to head in some way, shape, or form.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   It's almost like indie music.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.840]   I mean, there are all the kids listening to these weird bands you never heard of.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.680]   I think it's going to go that way with the writers.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.360]   I mean, I think a lot of them are going to have some trouble getting much traction, but
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.200]   you don't need as much traction if you're taking all the money.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   Right.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.760]   Amazon's deal with authors I'm seeing in our chatroom is 35%.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.640]   So it's even better.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.600]   And Jeff Bezos was on with John Stewart on The Daily Show.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.800]   Stewart asked this question, said, Jeff, why did you charge so much?
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   Why don't you cut the price?
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.520]   Bezos said, because it costs us that much, we can't charge any less.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.520]   Which might be correct.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.400]   You know, Amazon has its own self publishing arm.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.520]   It's a company called Book Surge.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:19.600]   And I wonder if there's anything being routed directly from Book Surge into the Kindle.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.720]   Well, I tell you, if I'm, you know, it's not the author's guild that should have been
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.800]   complaining about the Kindle.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.320]   It's the publishers.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.320]   It's Pearson.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.480]   It's Random House.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.520]   Those are the people who really threatened by this device.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.520]   Those are the people who are going to be disintermediating.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.000]   And if we go back to looking at what Hearst is doing, an open format from Hearst would
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.600]   once again allow the publishers theoretically to be able to sell their stuff online directly
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.560]   to another reader as well, where they don't have to pipe through Amazon.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.760]   I think maybe that's what Hearst is seen as an open opportunity.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.520]   Why wouldn't Hearst just jump on the Kindle?
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.000]   Why make your own device?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.240]   They are all the lot of the heard magazines are.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.680]   Can I make a comment?
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.920]   Some magazines at the newspaper.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   Yes, sir.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   Mr. Devorak, make a comment.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.120]   I was looking in the chat room and people were talking about Lulu.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.560]   Lulu is a complete ripoff.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560]   What?
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   Really?
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.560]   I love Lulu.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.320]   15% they take the author's commission just over head.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   It's ridiculous.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.320]   But they're printing it.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.320]   They're shipping it.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.920]   You know, if you went out there and found there's plenty of people that do print on demand
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.880]   shipping and printing and they don't take 15% out of the blue, they just charge you
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.880]   what it costs.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:29.880]   Oh, and then you charge a price over and above that to make your profit.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   So what about Blurb?
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.440]   Is that the same as Lulu?
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.600]   I never, I haven't looked at their Blurb as a deal.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   More photo oriented.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.960]   It seems like people like Corey Doctorow are in a great position here.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.240]   People who have their own audience, you had him on the show last week.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:48.480]   He was talking about how he has the change logged between editions of what he's going
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.200]   to push out to the publisher.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:54.240]   You know, Corey could readily just put his work wherever he wanted it.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.600]   I read an interesting article.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.640]   My daughter gets a magazine called Mental Floss, which is actually a pretty cool magazine
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.160]   for kids, you know.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:08.640]   And they wrote an article about Paul Coelho, the guy who wrote The Alchemist.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.240]   And Paul is very hip.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.400]   Paul is very with it.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.200]   It turns out, for instance, that the book wasn't selling in Russia.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.920]   The Russian edition wasn't selling.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.360]   So he put it for free online.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.760]   And it's the kind of book, I guess, that gets a lot of people excited about it because
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   it started selling.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.720]   The print edition started selling.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:31.080]   He like Corey has done that very counterintuitive thing, which is give it away online.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.600]   And he's done very, very well.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.480]   The books sold more than 10 million copies.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.880]   He's done very well by doing that.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.000]   Well, and I think that I think for people in the creative field, I think we're a lot of
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.160]   people and whether it's a future, whether it's video, but I think that there's a really
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.360]   important thing of maintaining your own brand and making sure people know who you are and
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.320]   building your own following, whether it's on your blog or on Twitter or on anything else
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.080]   that you're doing, so that you're portable, so that when you publish something to Amazon
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:02.600]   or to iTunes or to somewhere else that people know who you are and they'll actually go buy
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   it because of you.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.160]   And I think that's the kind of thing that we're seeing from, you know, Corey Dr. Rowe.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.160]   Well, that's what we do here.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.800]   I mean, really ultimately what you got to do is build a community that will support you.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   Whether you're Jonathan Colton, Peter Himmelen, who's coming in tonight, Corey Dr. Rowe, you
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.600]   build a community that loves your work and you bring it to them.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.160]   And you bring it straight to them and you say, "Hey, you like this?
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.160]   You support this."
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.400]   Again, Nine Inch Nails is a perfect example.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.400]   Nine Inch Nails?
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.400]   I mean, they sold out.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.520]   They only, what really made the money was their limited edition.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.600]   They gave the album away and had a limited edition that made three quarters of a million
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:39.840]   dollars in a week on because they had a strong, intense following of only a handful of people.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.800]   Well, you could do that if you're an established brand, but how easy is that to get started
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   with?
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:50.080]   I don't think we've actually seen yet anybody who's kind of taken off from that as the starting
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.080]   point.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.640]   Well, where was Corey Dr. Rowe before?
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   Was he on?
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.640]   He was never on a national brand.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   No.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   He built it up.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   I think you could do it.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.640]   I really, Jonathan Colton.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   I agree.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   Jonathan Colton.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   But over a very long period of time, you know, it's not something I think.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.520]   I think cream rises no matter.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   But am I taking it?
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.520]   I mean, you have to think about it as like a project.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.520]   It might take you a decade.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   Yes, it could be tomorrow.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.520]   What's a long period of time to you?
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.160]   How long does it take for a metallic?
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   10 to 15 years.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.160]   How long did it take for 15 years?
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.160]   15 years.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.160]   Not that one.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.440]   You should be able to build a brand in 18 months.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.440]   John is the king of brand building.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.040]   That's not true, but I can tell you it's doable in 18 months.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   Everything I know.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.440]   I say from scratch without the help of national media, it could take...
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.720]   But what I'm saying is people need to prepare for that.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.720]   If you knew anything about...
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:33.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   With the internet, I don't think it's a problem for 18 months.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   All you need is Twitter, baby.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.720]   We need to recommend you.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.440]   All I know is it took Mike Harrington a lot less time than that.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.960]   Yeah, there's a good example.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   Perfect example.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.160]   Boy, is he a brand?
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.160]   Yep.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   Wow.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.920]   I remember sitting and talking with him at Stanford when he had just started doing TechCrunch,
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:59.120]   which at the time he was doing a sort of a joint project with Keith Tear for another...
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   Who?
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   Who's that?
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120]   Amazing.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:09.200]   No, Keith has been around for a long time.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:14.400]   And you know, TechCrunch took on a life of its own and obviously by that time next year,
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.560]   it was an interesting conversation to look back on.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.320]   It was very quick, but it was.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:19.320]   It was a year.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   It was less than a year.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.320]   I would agree.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.400]   It takes you 15 years if your product is crap.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.120]   You can still get an audience, but...
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:30.760]   Boy, TechCrunch, because it was really right on, it really covered the stories, it was
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.200]   the place and word spreads fast among that audience.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:40.120]   Now that's key is the people who have done well with this at least so far have done well
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:46.360]   with the tech community because for instance us, our audience is very wired together.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.160]   Or in the record industry where you have an audience that's very...
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.920]   It's already tightly knit, you know, and people will say, "Ah, nine inch nails, on inch."
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   So you need that.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.800]   That might be some loose leaner.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.520]   Well, the people have to be on a computer.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.520]   That's the key.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.600]   Yeah, that's very key.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   For now.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.080]   I mean, over time, people are going to have more and more people will be on the computer,
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.160]   but definitely the reason that we picked the shows that we started with was because we
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.920]   knew that those were the start with the tech shows.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.720]   Yeah, those were the niches that we wanted to jump in.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.200]   Now Adam Corolla is number one on iTunes because it's gone beyond that.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   It's gone to mainstream media now.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Right.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   What's Adam Corolla doing on iTunes?
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   Adam Corolla lost his job.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.520]   I remember he was going to be the guy who saved Howard Stern's...
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.760]   You know, when Howard Stern went to satellite, he was going to save Infinity.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.640]   Big flop, lost his job, made a pod.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:36.320]   I should be nicer because I'm going to be on the podcast on Wednesday.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.160]   But he's made a podcast.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:44.440]   And the funny thing is, you know, flop in the mainstream media terms does not mean much.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:49.440]   When you go to the podcast, look at, we only have hundreds of thousands of people who listen
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.360]   to this show.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.280]   If your, you know, Infinity, that's not enough.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.440]   That's, you know, Howard Stern had tens of millions.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:57.440]   A broadcast TV show.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.440]   But it's fine for me.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.440]   I'll take it.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.680]   I'm buying a broadcast TV show that is a flop is five million or five or six million
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:07.360]   people or less is considered, you know, unmanageable, you know.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:11.280]   But if you look at a million people listening to your, listening to your show and you're
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.200]   getting let's say $30 CPM.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.320]   I mean, it's not, you know, that's a lot of money.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   That's a lot of money.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.320]   It's a lot of money.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   Hey, what's...
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.160]   Does it surprise you guys to know there are only 24 magazines available for the
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.160]   Kindle?
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   Yeah, it does.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.360]   And I'm very, it's very disappointing to me, but I have to say what the New Yorker, which
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:32.040]   just recently became available in the Kindle, that, that was a big deal for me.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.800]   But like because of the cartoons?
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.960]   Yeah, I like the car.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.680]   Well, I don't, I only read it for the pictures.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.680]   And you know, the newties, it's really big for you.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.400]   No, I'm a big New Yorker fan.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.160]   And my problem is we subscribe to the paper edition, but my between my wife and daughter,
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.760]   I never get to read it.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.080]   My daughter will actually, and I can't really stop her because I'm thrilled.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.840]   We'll take it and go upstairs and we never see it again.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.840]   And what am I going to say?
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.600]   No, you can't read the New Yorkers while I'm done.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.200]   No, I wanted to read it.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.800]   That's pretty good for a 16 year old.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   Hey, I want to take a little break here and talk a little bit about audible.com.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.920]   Audibles are sponsor and they're not going away.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   I'm going to tell you, even if you can get the Kindle can read to you, there's a big
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.400]   difference between a computer voice reading to you and a performance.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.760]   And that's what audible books really are.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.960]   They are performances by some of the best actors in the world.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.280]   They bring these things to life.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.640]   Now you may not know some of the names.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.280]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.880]   Sign up for the platinum account.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   That's two books a month.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.240]   You'll get a credit towards two books.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.400]   Then look at some of the books.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.840]   You may see the names of the readers.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.840]   You may not know them.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.440]   Believe me, you will come to know them.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.640]   It's a specialty.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.760]   Audibles, recording studios are located near Broadway.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.040]   They get some of the best actors, the best, most talented readers.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.360]   And these guys and gals bring a story to life.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:53.000]   I think this week, in honor of our newspaper discussion, our Audible pick is going to be
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.600]   all the President's Men, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.280]   I mean, this is what journalism to me.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:03.360]   There was a whole generation of kids my age who became investigative journalists, became
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:09.280]   reporters, became news people because of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward and all the
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   President's Men.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.280]   It was inspiring.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:17.160]   It's the story of Watergate, how a President was brought down by deep throat and brilliant
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.160]   reporting.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.360]   And if you've seen the movie or if you've heard the story, it is so dramatic.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.960]   Let me play a little bit of all the President's Men here for you.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.960]   This is, by the way, Richard Poe.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:33.160]   They'd run into a solid wall of riot-equipped Washington policemen who had pushed them back
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:38.660]   onto the campus of George Washington University with tear gas and billy clubs from their
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.960]   balconies, anxious tenants.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.960]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.760]   I also mentioned now the clips.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:47.120]   I'm a cheered and toasted when the pretentious clips are often in a lower quality.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.600]   But they have a new format now on Audible.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.440]   I'm really excited about it.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.960]   The E format is full CD quality.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.040]   Now I've always thought that the format for was good enough, but E is incredible.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.440]   I'm downloading all my books over again in the E format.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.360]   So if you're an Audible member, take a look at it.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.560]   This is also available in the E format.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.560]   I'm changing.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.560]   And it makes a difference?
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.560]   Oh, it sounds beautiful.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.560]   Okay.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.560]   I mean, it sounds good.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.280]   Anyway, if you've listened to Audible books, I never thought it was a problem.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:20.080]   I think it's something like 32 kilobits MP3 that the type four was.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.520]   E is now 128 kilobits high quality sounds.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.760]   These are on the ears, I imagine.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.920]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   It's just wonderful.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.520]   And they've done a great job of getting these books converted.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.920]   This book, even though it's an older book is already available in the E format.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:39.120]   If you saw Frost Nixon and you want to know more about that whole story, this is a great
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   one.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.000]   All the presidents men now, here's how you can get it.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.640]   As long as you're reading that, you might as well get another book about the same subject,
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.080]   The Secret Man, the story of Watergate's Deep Throat.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.720]   Now many years later, we finally found out who Deep Throat is.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:54.960]   Bob Woodward wrote the story.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:00.200]   This book came out, I think two years ago, three years ago, who was Deep Throat?
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.040]   Bob Woodward tells the story and you can hear that.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.040]   Make two books.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.960]   It all turns out to be a disgruntled employee.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:06.960]   It always is.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.960]   That's what it all came down.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:08.960]   It always is.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:26.960]   www.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:32.080]   couldn't get out of the car when I'm at the gym working out when I am walking the dog when I'm
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.240]   gardening, when I'm doing house. It's great for a house where I hate housework, but listen to an
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   audible, you know, suddenly the house is clean. And you and you don't even know how it happened.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:46.380]   Audible.com, slash to try it today. You're going to love it. And we thank them so much for the support
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:51.960]   of this week in tech. You know, Audible's owned by Amazon. So you got to figure Amazon is not going to
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:58.900]   can't be thinking that the Kindle reading is going to cannibalize the business they just bought.
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:04.500]   Right. Well, they win no matter what. Well, that's true. That's true. I know it's one of their goals. Jeff's
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:09.580]   business goal is to get every book on the Kindle. But I think it's also as goal to get as many books as
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:15.660]   possible, if not all books in audible format, which I I'm behind 100%.
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:20.780]   Everybody OK, we want to take a break. Shall we move on to our next story?
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.820]   Dwight, how you doing? You're already doing fine. He's going to charge up his iPhone. I'm charging my
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:31.740]   Kindle. Actually, I just got the note that said you were running low. What is it? You know, my battery life
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:38.140]   has been a little disappointing. It's been it's been about this like the first one. Yeah, they said it was
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:43.180]   going to be 25% better. I don't find it to be at all. What was the first one connected to an edge
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:48.700]   network or 3G? That's what I've been asking that it was my understanding that it was it was GPRS the
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.020]   first time around and it's edge now. But I've been told or EVDO now. But I've been told by everybody.
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:58.620]   It was EVDO. So I don't know. I don't know. Well, it's it has it's it's lasted. I charged it
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:05.100]   the day after I got it. I had it fully charged up on Wednesday. And I just now got the the message
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:08.140]   charged. Maybe I have maybe there's something wrong with my battery. I've charged it three times since
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:15.740]   Wednesday. I don't know. And I'm not doing a lot of text to speech. How much are you reading? A lot.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:21.740]   I love I have to say I'm transformed by this Denise. You're going to like it.
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:28.380]   Good. I'm thinking of getting one for my dad too. And I'm liking the fact that I went and checked the
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:33.980]   network availability. And it seems to be really, really good. He lives in a very rural place
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:39.420]   way up north. He lives in Mendocino. Yeah, sprints pretty good up in Mendocino. Yeah. So
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:45.260]   it's sprint. It's sprint BCS. So, okay. It's really they said it's got coverage there.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:49.580]   Didn't they have big fulfillment problems with the first one or was that just a big publicity
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:52.780]   sense? And all of the first ones sold out immediately and then you had to wait.
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:58.380]   Yeah. No. Well, that's the question. Is it the is it the Nintendo marketing technique or is it
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:02.860]   that they can't make them fast enough or what? They have never said how many they've sold.
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:07.180]   They won't say but they won't say but they but they were shortages whether they were artificial
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:11.820]   or all six of them. Yeah, exactly. We're sold out. We can't keep them in stock.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:17.340]   Well, one analyst estimated that they sold about 500,000. But how did he get that?
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.460]   How did he? Right. Right. I mean, we don't know where those numbers come from. But
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:25.260]   I would think I think probably that they. Seems high.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:31.580]   Does it seems high? And I think that they probably had a they probably wound up under
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:37.420]   under producing with the desire to make it look more desirable.
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:46.940]   Wouldn't put it past Jeff. I'm going to stand on what I've said but I really
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:51.580]   believe that this is the breakthrough that the iPod was. Do we think that Apple,
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:58.540]   if they build a tablet? Yeah, market. Market, John. I called the patient. I called the patient
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:05.180]   dead. Printbook's dead on March 2nd, 2009. I still think that Apple will build an iPhone that's
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:08.780]   about the same size as that. Wouldn't that be a great product? This almost looks like it.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:13.740]   And play video and we'll give it a real runs for its money. It's March 1st, by the way.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:18.940]   Well, this show comes out March 2nd. Well, and I think Apple will do it by July.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:24.300]   Really? This July? By this July. I would abandon this in a heartbeat. Right. You know,
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:28.220]   I'm looking at that thing on the screen there, Leo. Yeah. And the contrast sucks.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:32.540]   Yeah, it's the same. It's the same as before. You know, it's not
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:39.500]   it's not a breakthrough. It's for reading text. It's, you know, it's it's it's readable enough.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:43.820]   And if you have a bright if you have a good light on it, it's black ink on white papers better.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:48.460]   You know what I love that something you can't do with black ink on white paper. You can change
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:53.820]   great. Great ink on gray paper. It's great. It's great. But you can change for somebody who's old
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:59.820]   like me, not as old as you, John, but somebody's old. Oh, the fact that I can get this to basically
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:06.460]   large text format is fantastic. I just I just need more. You would need to do that if it was
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.860]   kind of had a good contrast. Well, that's true. I do I do it is a little harder to read.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.820]   Is I going to read off the, you know, a little E 71 Nokia, which has got like two point type?
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.500]   I don't have any trouble reading it because it's got extremely high contrast. Yeah.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.940]   Leo, have you had a problem accidentally buying books with it?
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.300]   Not yet, but they do. I didn't have any.
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:32.060]   Why? Getting on it. Yeah, right. Twice. I bought what happened is at least on mine,
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:40.860]   when I press a button, the button for click an item on the screen, there's a delay. And the first
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:47.340]   time I tried to get past the menu, I hit the I hit the button and I hit it again. The second
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:53.500]   click triggered the buy button on the next page. And I bought a book I wasn't intending to buy.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.340]   Yikes. But now they do I think this must be common because they do say immediately,
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:02.540]   you can take it back. Yes. And I did. But what they end up doing is they charge you and then
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:06.860]   they issue a credit. That's not so good. So and I've done that twice now with this.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:11.580]   The biggest improvement to me is it's just harder to turn the page than it was before. It was so
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.740]   easy to accidentally lose your place. Right. And they had that that's a big deal. They've had
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:20.300]   a few little things that on on the surface don't seem to make a difference. But I think do for
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.740]   instance, when you lose your place, it was very hard to get back to your place before you'd have
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:29.740]   to kind of jump around. Now they have go to last page red. Just something something like that makes
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:36.540]   a huge difference in usability. So I'm very happy with it. And I have now read. I mean, I've been,
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:41.020]   I've probably read 20 hours on it and I'm really enjoyed it. It's comfortable. It's very comfortable.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.340]   I don't know how you can do this, really, because you're on the air 24 hours a day.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.780]   I was laughing when he said he does housework. I don't know when he does.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.980]   Yeah. You you were laughing. You ought to hear my wife. I can hear from here.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:02:02.300]   Housework. What is he? What is he talking about? Housework. Speaking of a new iPhone,
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:07.660]   CBS, I think CBS is really showing that they actually have a little bit of a of an inkling
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:13.580]   about this whole thing is about now is putting Star Trek episodes on iPhones, along with CSI and
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:18.940]   other full episodes of TV. Yeah. Yeah. I say full with an asterisk.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:21.420]   Oh, yeah. What's the answer? This is the new iPhone app. Yeah.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:31.260]   So I installed it. Yeah. And so the new it's TV.com. So if you search for CBS or TV.com on the app
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:37.420]   store or whatever you can you can download it in. It'll play on 3G or Wi-Fi. So it will play
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.980]   beat up one. I will say that having an application that does this is a completely different thing
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:48.140]   than having a webpage, which is what NBC did much better. I mean, it's just the experience of
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:53.500]   actually going through them is great versus like Hulu versus Hulu. But what I only think
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:57.660]   it's a little frustrating is it's full episode. And then you get here and there's six little videos.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:01.100]   So you have to click one and then you'll play it. I guess it'll be an ad. Oh, it's a chunk of the
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:05.500]   time. But there is these little videos that you have to chunk through. And not clearly you're not
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:10.140]   a Star Trek fan. Well, yeah, you wouldn't mind so much. I love Star Trek. But but the.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:15.660]   I want tribbles on my iPhone. No doubt. Is that is that you're showing the application right now?
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:20.700]   Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing is there's not that many full episodes on here. You
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:27.020]   you know, and there's a lot of snippets and only only, you know, a few full episodes. Well,
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:33.180]   Hulu was like that when it first started. Right? Yeah. Hopefully, I have to say the experience is
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.060]   actually pretty good. It is. But if you're on edge, you're out of luck. No, it works on ed.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.700]   Well, 3G or 3G, I see. I don't think it'll work on Wi-Fi.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:45.260]   How does it play on 3G pretty well? It plays OK. I mean, it plays on what you'd expect with a
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:49.340]   3G connection compared to a Wi-Fi connection. I haven't been able to test the Wi-Fi yet. I just.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:54.060]   And this is free. It is free. How many spots is it like Hulu or that's just kind of a lower number
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:57.340]   of commercials? You know, I just I just saw it today and installed it today. So I haven't hit the
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:01.980]   spots yet. I just wanted to see if it would work. I haven't seen any commercials in it.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:06.940]   More or less than we have. Yeah, that's the cutoff. I think less.
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.980]   Would you pay Comcast $10 a month for online TV and article in the
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:18.940]   new TV says that Comcast. Probably kicking and screaming, but Comcast is going to start doing
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:28.540]   online video as well. Do they have to do this? I guess they do. Now, the question is, will they
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:32.380]   charge extra? How are they going to do it? Are they going to maybe say, all right, you're an HBO
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:38.700]   subscriber. So we'll let you watch HBO online. Well, no, it sounds like that what they're talking
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.860]   about is original content, which could be really good for you or somebody. Well, they do this on
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:47.980]   the fan. So the idea is that it's not necessarily what they're saying right now, at least to begin
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:52.300]   with is they're not it won't be it won't be the surprise. No, they don't want to they don't want
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:58.540]   to do that. So they so it's going to be original content new content that they're that they're going
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.740]   to be adding to it, which is great for smaller developers, I think people like you more than me.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:10.460]   Netflix is also saying we might spin off our streaming business as a separate business. So you
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:15.980]   could be a Netflix DVD subscriber or an Netflix streaming subscriber. I think I just become a
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.340]   streaming subscriber. Yeah, me too. Although the only thing I like about Netflix now is being
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:22.540]   able to rent Blu-rays because I don't really want to commit to another piece of plastic anymore. I
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:29.100]   don't want to buy plastic anymore. And but I do like my Blu-rays until charging more for the Blu-rays,
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:34.460]   right? A buck more much. A buck more much. Yeah, I have which is not too bad, but it's just insulting.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:38.860]   Why don't you get enough from me? Why are you charging a buck extra? They get a lot for me.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:43.900]   You think that's okay, John, that they should? Well, at the moment, yeah, and I think just for a
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:48.860]   while, you know, it's a way of I mean, that's basically the business is going to die,
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:52.220]   and they got to do what they can have to do to stay in business. And it's a good service. I'm like,
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.900]   I don't think it's a bad thing. And man Blu-ray is far is really nice to watch.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:00.780]   It is. It's a huge improvement. I think this Comcast thing is pretty clueless.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:04.300]   I'm not going to be paying my cable company anymore than I already do.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.980]   Well, what if they did it for free? Would you? Well, I mean, they do if you're already.
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.820]   For free. I mean, I think they're missing a good opportunity here. They could kind of do what
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:17.340]   Tivo does, which is try and aggregate some good web content and point people to it since they
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:23.340]   have a bunch of people who are using their service already. And you know, if Comcast could sort of
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:28.780]   build their brand by doing that more power to it. But I think if they if they had quality programming
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:32.060]   within certain niches, I think that they that it would be an opportunity because I mean,
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:37.020]   I know that my I know people who buy an extra the extra package so that they can watch their
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:41.580]   home football team or they can watch showtime or they can watch now. But the thing is that niche
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:46.380]   content has to be really good. But if they added things that are if they if they queued off of
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:50.540]   what was already happening in, you know, the podcasting world took some of those top ones,
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.860]   gave them a little bit more money and got something good. I could definitely see people saying,
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:59.020]   oh, pay 10 extra bucks because I really want to watch people breaking, you know, rebuilding cars or
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:05.180]   a lot though for this kind of thing. That is a lot of money on top of, you know, $120 a year for
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:11.740]   subscription to look at like low end probably semi amateurish crap. Well, I agree if that's what
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:17.340]   it is, I think that that wouldn't work. But I think that if they them charging for it also creates a
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:22.380]   revenue stream to start giving people who maybe have gotten really good at doing stuff for 500 bucks
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:27.900]   a show, giving them 5,000 a show and, you know, having them, you know, increase the production value.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:32.860]   I don't think anybody's going to pay for anything I do. I think this is an advertising based
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:41.340]   for myself. I tag something for Twitter. You should take a look at and it it actually goes
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:47.900]   for journalism discussion from earlier too. There was a good episode of On the Media and PRs On
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:52.220]   the Media. I love that show by the way. Yeah, that's a great show. Where they were looking at
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:58.220]   the demise of the newspaper industry and they highlighted this company called Kitchingle.
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:05.900]   Great name. Well, Kitchingle, I guess. Yeah, you want to say it. It's an interesting model.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:14.380]   It's you decide how much money each month you want spread over the things that you're consuming.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:18.700]   That's a good idea because the thing that's driving people crazy is this
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:28.140]   penny, Annie, 1Z2Z. I got 23 bills. Right. The problem with Kitchingle is what they're
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:32.860]   hoping people will do is put the little Kitchingle badge on their site. And then as you're reading,
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:37.900]   you decide if you want that logged as something you're enjoying until you click the badge.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:42.060]   And then Kitchingle aggregates all your clicks and says, "Okay, you've spent more time on the New
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:47.340]   York Times and some time over here on Twitch and we'll take your money that you're giving for this
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:52.300]   content and we'll spread it out according to where your attention has gone." Very interesting.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:57.740]   Yeah. I think there could be a more effective way of tracking you rather than making you click
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:01.900]   something. Are you a regular on that show because I see you've been on it a number of times?
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.220]   No, I've only been on it once. Oh, okay. But now I listen to it all the time.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.740]   Yeah. I missed your episode. What were you talking about?
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:18.220]   I was talking about a shield block case in California. Do you remember the Apple V-Dose case from 2006
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:25.420]   where I think it was the "Think Secret" people? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We're saying that they didn't
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:30.700]   want to have to disclose to Apple. You remember it was about the... They had some rumor that they had,
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:34.780]   but they didn't want to say where they got it. Yeah, it was about the... What were the little
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:37.500]   spaceship things? They're routers. Yeah, airports.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:42.940]   They had some... They'd broken some pre-release information about what they're... They had a real
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:48.540]   picture of it. Yeah. Yeah. And so there was a big lawsuit and Apple wanted to get at their sources.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:56.380]   And the California court said it went into this whole question of what journalism and are we
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:02.940]   going to distinguish between online journalists and any other kind of journalists? And in California,
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.340]   under our shield block, the court interpreted that as being no, journalism. Journalism,
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:12.380]   it doesn't matter who you are doing it and we're going to protect your sources.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.020]   Now, agree with that. Wasn't there a federal decision recently about that? Or no, maybe it's a...
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:23.500]   There are two different bills pending right now in Congress to amend the federal shield block.
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:29.260]   The House version does not really protect bloggers, but the Senate version says,
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:33.260]   "Well, anybody who's essentially in the business of journalism, which might leave a little hole
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:38.380]   for bloggers, I guess." Yeah, no, absolutely. The Senate version is much more inclusive in the way
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:46.060]   that the California court was back in that case. The House version wants to put some sort of bar
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:51.260]   of how much money you actually have to be making from your acts of journalism, which...
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:57.020]   As we were after a phase when we were talking about competing all the time.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:00.060]   That's ridiculous. I think that all of this is going to end up in the Supreme Court no matter
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:04.300]   what, no matter how they craft this law, the first time that they call or someone who's got...
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:10.060]   If EFF jumps in, there's going to be a great opportunity to take this to the Supreme Court
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:16.460]   and nullify anything that's there anyway. Right. I mean, even if your hobby is journalism,
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:21.500]   you should get a little credit. So the shield law is what protects you from revealing your sources.
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:27.660]   Okay. So right now, as it stands, if you're a blogger outside of the state of California and
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.940]   you have a scoop, can the... But wait a minute. The law is very firm state to state. It's different
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:38.940]   from state. I mean, I know means it's familiar with it. But I mean, it seems like real journalists
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.980]   go to jail all the time for not revealing their sources. Doesn't that happen from time to time?
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:50.140]   It depends on the state and what is protected. I distinctly remember an episode of The West Wing.
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:55.340]   No. But I mean, that's... So there was an reporter in New York. It was around the
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:12:00.060]   plane case, right? Yeah. Spent some time until he revealed his source and they were
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:05.340]   seated. She did, right? Yeah. And then worked it out. So that's state by state, Denise. That's not
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:11.420]   federal law. Right. There is a federal shield law. But yes, each of the states have their own
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:14.700]   take on that through their own state. I guess I should probably find out. Well, I would...
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.820]   Not to completely change the subject, but while we're talking about legality,
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.180]   there's a story on your list here that we really have to get to now that we have
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:27.580]   an expert on the... Finally, we got somebody who knows what she's talking about.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:33.340]   Apple says iPhone jailbreaking is illegal. Yeah. This is an older story, but I would like to get
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:38.140]   your take on this, Denise, in just a moment. But before we do, in fact, we have a couple
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:42.060]   other stories. Nice Steve's. Yeah. How you like that, huh? We have a couple other stories, including
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:51.660]   Apple's... A VP at Apple saying, "No, Steve's coming back. He's coming back." And some more
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:59.980]   interesting stories, including Gmail going down. And a competition in the online App Store fart
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:10.540]   space. Apparently. It didn't quite have Bruja. Yes. It's quite a kerfuffle, if you will. But before
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:16.060]   why should that get a laugh? I am not a teenager. It didn't, Leo. It didn't. Okay, thank you. I'm the
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:20.860]   only one. Before we go on to that, I do want to mention my friends at Citrix who do go to
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:26.220]   meeting. That's what we use all the time for online meetings. And I highly recommend it. If you are
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.060]   in a situation where you're stuck on a conference call, poor Denise sitting here with the phone
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:36.300]   glued to her head, you know, you're talking to somebody on the phone. You know, he's playing Tetris.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:40.300]   She's checking her email on her Blackberry. They're not paying any attention to what you're doing.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:44.220]   That's because what you're doing is not so very compelling. That's why you need go to
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.540]   meeting. Go to meeting takes a boring conference call where you're not grabbing people and makes
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:54.620]   it engaging and interesting through the use of visuals, ladies and gentlemen. Simply put,
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:59.500]   when you're going to have an on a conference call, you could do it ahead of time through an email.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.940]   It's very simple. A couple of clicks of the email or you can do even do it when you're on the phone
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:08.300]   with somebody. You say, "Look, I got to show you this. Go to gotomeeting.com. Here's the meeting ID.
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.740]   They don't have to install any software. They don't have to jump through any hoops." And by the way,
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:15.740]   if you're trying to sell somebody on something, you don't want to make them work. This is very
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:20.940]   easy. They go to gotomeeting.com. Suddenly, they're seeing your computer on their screen, by the way,
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:26.540]   Mac or Windows. They see the computer. They see the PowerPoint or the keynote. They'll see your
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:32.380]   drawings. You can collaborate together on a document. That's kind of how I use it, is working together
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:37.980]   with other people because we have a far flung group of people that we work with. You can also
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:41.580]   use it for training if you have an application and they don't. You can show them how to use it.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.980]   This thing is amazing. Dick DiBartolo, the gizwiz, used it with Ludwig. They were working together
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:50.460]   on a site. Ludwig's in Poland. Dicks in New York City. They used gotomeeting and they were able to
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:56.140]   see what was going on. It's very affordable. One low flat monthly rate. You don't meet as often as
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:15:00.140]   you want. You don't have to count the meetings or count the minutes. And now you could try it free
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:04.060]   for 30 days, which I would recommend. This is a great thing to show your boss or your clients to
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.700]   try it to see what they can do for you. It's very addictive. I got to warn you. Go to
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:16.140]   meeting.com/twit. Go to meeting.com/twit. Spend 30 days with go to meeting. You'll see what I'm
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:22.060]   talking about. Citrix is a great company. They've done this right. And go to meeting is the best
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.860]   product on the market. I've tried all the others. This is the one. God, we had a meeting the other
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.700]   day with our payroll. I'm not going to name names of their payroll company. They were using some
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:39.260]   other companies solution. I wondered, like Shake 'em and say, "Please, this is horrible. This is
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:44.380]   painful. I couldn't do it on a Mac. I had to go down. Go over to a PC. I had to download and
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:48.700]   install software. I had two active ex-controls I had to click. I mean, the thing was I'm going,
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.500]   this is a nightmare. You can't make a client do this. That's why go to meeting. It's just simple.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.500]   Don't just do it. Go to meeting.com/twit. We thank them so much for their support.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:07.900]   So John, you're saying that what? Hello? Oh, John went off to basis Turkey.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:15.020]   He posed the question and Denise is here. Thank goodness to answer this question.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:21.420]   So the basis for contending that there's something illegal about jail breaking your
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:30.460]   iPhone is the DMCA, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. What the Copyright Office can do is give
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:37.500]   exemptions from violating that act. So they can say, "Well, in the letter of the law, this would be
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:43.500]   wrong, but we say it's okay." Right. So you see Apple coming down on one side of this
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:51.420]   exemption alternative saying, "No, we don't need an exemption for this. It should be against the
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:55.980]   DMCA to jailbreak your iPhone." Oh, okay. So they're not asking for exemption. They're saying on the face
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:03.740]   of this, the law says it's illegal. Right. When are we going to get rid of this idiotic DMCA? Oh, please.
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:08.940]   Is there any chance? No, no. If you look at who is getting appointed and what's going on right now,
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:16.060]   I don't see that happening anytime soon. Right. So on the other side, you have EFS who is--
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:20.460]   They ask for an exemption. Right. And what is the current status of that?
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:31.500]   It's in process. I'm not sure exactly when it all gets worked out, but it will happen this year.
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:38.620]   Yeah. But traditionally, unlocking a phone is not illegal, which is kind of what jailbreaking
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.860]   is, correct? I mean, why is this exemption worthy? Yeah, didn't the FCC-- Well, they're forcing
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:47.580]   you unlock, though. They're not-- The FCC can have-- I mean, if it's by rule, but if someone's
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.340]   actually changing the code to unlock it, it is a circumf-- But they're not unlocking it. That's
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:54.780]   the irony of it. They're not using it with a different carrier. They're just saying, "I want to--
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:59.420]   all you're saying when you jailbreak is, I would like to get apps from somebody besides Apple."
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:02.620]   But it's circumventing the DRM, which is on the face of it, illegal.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:06.620]   No, you're right. I think it's a bad idea. But I think that's--
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.300]   Is that it? That's it. That's why they needed it. It's circumvention.
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:17.260]   This stupid law, just appalling. All right. Well, we're all in agreement on that.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:25.660]   There is a battle in the application store between a program called Pull My Finger and I
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:30.780]   Farb, but I really don't want to send to that. The big question is whether you can trademark
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:35.820]   Pull My Finger. You can't trademark Pull My Finger. It's only existed. I think there's previous
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.500]   art. I think there's previous art for the last 15 years. I'm going to ask my attorney Denise Howell,
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:44.460]   Denise, I would like to trademark Pull My Finger. Could I? I would tell you that that would be a
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:50.300]   very weak trademark. And why would you want it anyway? I think Bierdock-Com has the trademark
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:55.100]   on it originally, actually. There was that big fight over the I-Bier application and--
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:58.460]   Well, like Heineken or somebody made an application and they said,
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:03.340]   "Yours, give it away the application that we're charging for." It's funny. There must be money in
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:07.340]   the iPhone store. People wouldn't be fighting so bitterly. Oh, there's a lot of money in the
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:11.740]   iPhone store. And yet we're finding that you cannot charge more than two or three bucks for an app.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:18.540]   Well, and I think that that's-- It's the old line. We'll make it up on volume.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:24.540]   Because of that's what's happening is that there was the case with David Pogues' book.
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:30.540]   They released-- which was brilliant-- putting his iPhone, the missing manual,
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:39.660]   on the iPhone as an app. And they initially released it at $4.99 as a grand opening sale.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:46.540]   Then they moved it up to $9.99 and sales dropped by 75%. This was in Saul Hansel's Bitts blog this
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:52.940]   week. And what they wound up doing was bringing it back down to $4.99. They kind of found where
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:58.700]   people would actually buy it. And I just think that it's-- I think people are making a lot of
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:05.500]   money. They're just making it in $2.99, $3.99, $1.99 apps. It's interesting because Steam,
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:13.660]   which is Valve's online gaming service, found that they would sell huge-- We talked about this
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:18.780]   last week, huge numbers of applications when they cut the price 50%.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:25.340]   Is it because of today's tough economic times? Or this is just always true that maybe people
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:29.820]   just overcharging for software? There's a rule in direct marketing that's kind of interesting.
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:35.900]   And I don't think it applies to all pricing. But the rule is-- and it's a very solid one.
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:40.140]   And people-- direct marketing experts, in fact, are one of the guys that the guy who heads up
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:45.340]   direct marketing over into it. Actually, showed me some documentation for this.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:54.300]   Whatever you charge for a product in a direct marketing environment, the net sales will be
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:59.820]   exactly the same. So if you charge $10, you'll sell half as many as you charge for $5. And if you
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.900]   charge $250, you'll sell another twice as many. When that's just macroeconomics, that's the old
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.620]   supply to make. And with direct marketing, the argument is you want to go with the lowest price
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:13.420]   that gets you the maximum number of people. Because in fact, the real money is in the mailing list.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:19.740]   Oh, that's interesting. Well, I know we had some of our software. We literally doubled the price.
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:25.500]   And then we doubled the sales. You charge twice as much and you sold twice as much.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.180]   And it doubled the sales. That happens a lot. In fact, that happens with wineries.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:35.660]   In fact, I did some work with Robert Craig winery up in Napa Valley. And they used to sell their
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:41.980]   ones for 35 bucks and 40 bucks. When they went to $75 a bottle, the sales skyrocketed,
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:46.380]   which just tells you how dumb wine buyers are. But I think that same wine,
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.740]   this happens in a lot of industries because it's a perceived value. But I think that that does not
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:54.860]   exist in the iPhone area because people expect it to be 99 cents. So it better. It has to be
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:59.100]   really good if it's over. Yeah. See, that's the difference. I buy wine by the price.
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:06.780]   But I buy iPhone applications by the pretty picture. I have some some some bonehead who's on my
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:10.780]   Skype just sent me a note saying this works with hookers too. Okay, thank you.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:17.900]   None of us will admit any expertise in that particular area. Moving along, Dell is in deep
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:25.740]   trouble. Fourth quarter sales dropped 16%. They now want to trim costs by $1 billion.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:33.020]   If you thought support from Dell was going downhill before, imagine how do you cut costs for a bill
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:37.820]   when your margins are razor thin to begin with? I think that one of the ways they're doing that
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.420]   in that article, they're talking about the fact that it is they're outsourcing more.
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.940]   You know, they're going to send more of their manufacturing out. They've closed the North Austin,
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:51.900]   Texas plant. But I think that one of the things that we're going to see in this recession is that
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:58.300]   a lot of manufacturing is going to be gone overseas by the end of this because now there's so much
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:02.780]   pressure on them. In a way, this is the, you know, the post industrial era, right? And where
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:07.740]   everybody has said for years, we're moving from an industrial economy to a service economy.
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:13.100]   And the bad, the bad economic news is just forcing this to happen more. Much faster. Yeah.
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:18.700]   Dell employees, I was surprised 78,900 people. It's a lot of people.
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:25.900]   What were they doing? What the hell are they making? They say they're going to save the bulk of the
[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:32.540]   billion will come from reducing the cost of designing, sourcing and building. I just know they
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:36.700]   spent that much money on design. Boy, you wouldn't know it to look at it. This stuff all is designed
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:41.420]   in China. It looks crappy. I don't know. Well, now they have red and blue. You realize how rare
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:45.900]   that is when you look at, you know, it's just a handful of guys at Apple that design every Johnny
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:51.340]   I. Yeah. And it's just higher. They have a whole division there. That's one of the leading
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.100]   industrial design firms in the world. They used to, they used to have sources to places like
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:24:01.660]   frog design and idea. That's all they're going to ask now. But I mean, as far as the decision
[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:05.340]   decision makers at Apple, I think you're still a handful of guys that make it. But there's one.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:10.220]   One, right. Well, and he's on vacation. Well, and that was interesting.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:19.100]   And I understand. You know, the Apple meeting, the Apple investor meeting, one investor,
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:28.060]   that only one pressed the directors on jobs health and said, when is jobs going to
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:32.300]   come back? And director Arthur Levinson said,
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:38.140]   nothing's changed since jobs announced January 14th he was going to leave. We expect to have him back
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:46.620]   in June by the end of June. I don't know what to say about that. I guess that's good news.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.780]   That's the new. We'll see. We'll see. I mean,
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:54.460]   either have nor won't is there Denise as a director have any responsibility to the shareholders to
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:59.980]   tell the truth. I got they have fiduciary duties to their shareholders. So they can't just make
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:06.860]   something up. Yeah. Here was a little bit of a scary story. It's almost comedic in its
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:13.020]   extent. The Marine one, which is President Obama's the president's helicopter
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:19.900]   was compromised by a contractor who had appeared a peer file sharing program on his computer.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:26.380]   And it saw the whole hard drive. Apparently this brings up a topic I wrote about about I think
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:31.420]   about eight years ago. And I've revisited it a couple of times and I bring it up and people
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:37.740]   always think I'm joking. People who use computers, just like people who drive cars,
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:43.260]   should be licensed. If you're a defense contractor going on Marine one, I agree with you.
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:50.380]   I agree with you. If you have on your computer the plans, the communications information,
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:56.700]   the schematic, the schematics, the avionics, the network information, and you've put
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:59.980]   lime wire on your system. My thing is that why are you connected to the internet?
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:04.380]   If you have that information, why is that computer connected to the internet?
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:07.660]   This guy is so stupid that not only does it put lime wire on there, but he overrides the
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:11.500]   standard settings, which by the way, do not make the whole thing visible and says, "Hey,
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:17.580]   you could have anything you want. Whatever you want." I do want to point out that the people
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:22.540]   who figured this out, that it happened, was a company outside of Pittsburgh. I'm from Pittsburgh,
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:28.940]   so I have to cranberry township. I've been to cranberry many times. So it's a beautiful place.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:36.460]   This happens all the time in businesses. Businesses are constantly finding programs like lime wire
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:42.540]   and bear share on their computers. It's a real problem with industrial espionage.
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:48.460]   She's Louise. I guess the guy will lose his job, but it's kind of a little late.
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:57.580]   This was a defense contractor. This is somebody who in theory has to adhere to security standards
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:01.820]   that are required in order for them to be contractors with the department of defense.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.660]   I mean, the other thing to realize is that this is the new helicopter, I believe. I don't think
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:10.780]   it's the old ones. I think it's the new design that are teetering on the brink of them not making
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:14.860]   them because of the economy, because the question is, should we spend them? They're the most expensive.
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.660]   These helicopters cost as much as an F-22.
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:24.620]   Yeah, they're incredibly expensive helicopters. There's been a big question about whether they're
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:28.940]   going to move forward. This undermines that. You got to imagine that the company's building it
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:33.580]   that we're contracting with that defense contractor are going to be insanely upset because now they're
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:37.020]   like, "Well, why should we build them?" Because I ran has the schematics.
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:43.020]   That was who got it. We went to an IRAN IP address. That's the Iranian IP address.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:48.300]   Oh, that's even worse. It's like the Rebels get in the hold of the Death Star.
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:51.900]   Worse nightmare. The Rebels getting a hold of the Death Star.
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:58.300]   Is Alex Nuzzi Lucas fan? No, Bothan's fan died in this. It was simply a peer-to-peer.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:03.580]   See, if the Rebels had only had peer-to-peer, they would not have had any Bothan's dying
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:07.100]   to get over to the Death Star. Is that an Apple product?
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:12.540]   Bothan's? No, I ran. I ran. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know.
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:18.940]   So it's true, though, that if you had written this as a plot line in Star Wars,
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:22.300]   they would have been thrown out as too far-fetched. Corny.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:25.900]   Corny. Oh, well, somebody put a peer in here and Stormtroopers had a peer-to-peer
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.780]   on the Death Star and we were able to download the entire thing.
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:36.380]   Armtroopers aren't so goofy as all that. Denise Howell is online at imetdinese.com.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:41.580]   You should also listen to this week in Law, her wonderful podcast all about tech law and IP.

[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:55.740]   Oh, let's follow everybody. Follow Denise. I follow you.
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:59.100]   Thank you. Yes. d Howell with two Ls.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.180]   Do you follow her on Twitter? Oh, oh, Twitter. No, I guess I follow her.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.500]   He just follows her around. I follow her on Twitter.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:09.580]   All right, Denise, thank you for being here. We really appreciate you're taking the time
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:13.420]   from your vacation. Thank you so much. Always a pleasure. This is a vacation for me, Leo,
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.620]   coming on Twitter. Yeah, and you don't have to take care of your son. Your husband has
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.820]   him out on the golf course. Teaching him nature's greatest game.
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:25.100]   Dwight Silverman, we really appreciate your time from the old school.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:28.780]   Well, I appreciate you having me. He's the old school. A newspaper man.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.700]   Not yet. Let's not call it that yet. An insane wretch.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:41.020]   I'm a blogger too. I know blogs.cron.com/techblog and I read it every day. In fact, I steal your links.
[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:44.380]   All right. It's a great blog. You keep up on everything.
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:51.100]   And my Twitter handle is D Silverman. D Silverman like D Howell. Right. Excellent.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:56.380]   Somebody sent me an email, John C. Devorek saying, hey, did Devorek get knocked off of Twitter?
[01:29:56.380 --> 01:30:04.140]   There's no the real Devorek D-A-V-O-R-A. Dude, you got to spell it right. Then you'll find him.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:08.780]   He is the real Devorek D-V-O-R-A. Yeah. Now I need 50 more to get to 45,000,
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:13.100]   which of course is half a yours, but it's beside the point. Oh, me. I'm nothing. I'm number 38 on
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:16.220]   the Twitter list. I don't know the whole thing's gotten out of control. Thanks to your Brittany
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:21.100]   Spears. It's not. And this is a long conversation that I don't really want to get into, but
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:24.620]   we're not going to do it. Don't do it. No, no, no, stop, stop, stop. It's the Twitter suggested list.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:29.980]   And you seeing people now getting 10,000 new followers a day because they're on that suggested
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:35.420]   list. And those of us not on the list, how do we get on the list? I don't know that nobody
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:40.140]   knows how to get on the list. I saw you in our local ink stained newspaper on that point, Leo.
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:46.620]   Yes. The LA Times. Not that I'm bitter. The Times was bitter because the New York Times has two
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:52.700]   yes, two listings on the suggested list and has gone whoosh and Twitter hasn't mentioned the LA
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.540]   Times and they're just the rest of us are just stuck growing at the normal few hundred a day or
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:02.540]   whatever. And these other guys are getting 5, 10,000 a day. I know, it's totally stupid.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:06.300]   No, no, you're upset about this. No, I'm not. And it underscores actually the
[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:13.020]   real silliness of these numbers. Finally, in a way, I'm glad because it finally kind of just kind of
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:17.580]   diffuses the whole topic. Yeah, it's Twitter. We're smart. They would rotate that list frequently.
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.340]   That's what they should do. Yeah. I'm never they're never going to put me on it because I'm too
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:25.500]   outspoken a critic. So that's fine. I don't care. So anyway, you can find me at channeldevorac.com
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:30.460]   and the real devorac on Twitter. That's the place. That's the place. Alex Lindsey is at
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:36.940]   the pixel core.com as well as the pixel core.tv. And he is Alex Lindsey with an A on Twitter. Yes.
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:42.060]   Am I right? That's correct. I am correct. So why? S a y. I get I get I get emails going. I can't
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:46.780]   find you on Twitter. And then it's always S E Y wasn't the wasn't John Lindsey, the late mayor of
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:52.220]   New York City. L E Y as if he was a I think he was a Y as well. It's not very many of us. So we
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:56.860]   it's unusual. Yeah, it's it's E Y is much more common. The common spell. You have it on your
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:03.580]   chiron Leo as a lens day. You're right. Wednesday. Oh my goodness. The whole day. I'm horrified.
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:12.220]   I've had it misspelled and I'm not gonna cry. It's L I N D S A Y there. Go Lindsay.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:21.020]   Lindsay. What does that mean in Greek? It's not it's not Greek. It's Scottish. It mostly means that
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:26.780]   the informal meaning is is we caused lots of wars in Scotland and then they kicked us out.
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:33.340]   I won't wear a kill. Yeah. Unless I've got a sport and I'm Leo LaPoe. We thank you so
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:36.540]   much for joining us. Remember, you can listen to this show each and every week automatically
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:41.900]   downloaded to your divisive choice. If you're using an iPod use iTunes, we're in the Apple store,
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:47.900]   the iTunes store in the podcast section as are all the Twitter podcasts, but we're also in the Zoom
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:56.540]   store and and other stores, whatever they might be. We're all there. Anything else I should mention?
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:33:02.700]   Colleen, anybody? Dane. I can tell all you new world journalists when you might get thrown in
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:11.260]   contempt of contempt of court under the narrow federal field box, which I looked up after we got.
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:19.660]   Am I okay? Am I okay? Under the broader state laws, you're usually immune from contempt, but under
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:25.820]   the federal law, it can be pierced and they if they can show that the confidential information
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:30.780]   is necessary and not obtainable through other sources. So if you clam up even in the face of
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:34.620]   that showing, that's when you're going to jail. And that's what happens from time to time in
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:40.860]   the Valerie Plame case, for instance. Exactly. Yeah. Wow. Thank you, Denise. I'll make sure not
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:45.420]   to clam up in future. Another twit is in the can.
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:34:10.540]   Yeah. Round the horn. Round the horn. All right.
