[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.920]   Netcasts you love.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.040]   This is Twit.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.600]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.400]   at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.200]   This is Twit, this weekend tech.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.480]   Episode 81 for Christmas Eve 2006, the early years.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.800]   Hi, this is Leo LaPorps.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.120]   We weren't planning to put out an episode of Twit
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.600]   on this Christmas Eve 2006.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.520]   But thanks to the work of one Alfred Chan of Hong Kong,
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.960]   intertextus on the message boards, we do have an episode.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.240]   This is kind of an early years compilation
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.960]   Alfred put together.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.160]   Episodes 0 through 9, you'll hear some of the really earliest
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.800]   Twit stuff.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.880]   And for those of you who haven't heard these early episodes,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.480]   it might be kind of fun to hear how far we've come in some ways
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.520]   and a little we've changed in others.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280]   As always, this episode brought to you
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.840]   by the good folks at Dell.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.400]   Remember to check the Leo's picks page at twit.tv/del.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.320]   This will be the last Dell commercial of the year.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.040]   And unless they renew, maybe the last Dell commercial ever.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.560]   So let's get some clicks.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.640]   Just go to twit.tv/del, click any of the links there.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.320]   And anything you want to buy, whether it's
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.000]   great Dell 24-inch displays, I'm going to be loving them.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.400]   For a Dell XPS desktop or laptop or Dell Dimension,
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.280]   any of the Dell products, even a TV set we get credit for.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.800]   That's twit.tv/del.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.240]   We thank them for their support in the year 2006.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.720]   And once again, thanks to Alfred for putting this together.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.800]   Thanks to to all the folks who have made Twit possible
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.240]   over the past couple of years.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.760]   I too many to named for so the Twit panelists.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.200]   But even people like Ashley Whit, who created the great Twit
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.640]   ending themes and songs.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.760]   I'll play that before at the end of the show.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.720]   Mark Glasgow did the Twit opening theme.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.960]   The Twit artwork.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.440]   Nitro Zack and Snag even done the current version.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.120]   But a number of other people have worked on.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.280]   Of course, Dorothy Yamamoto, who did our original Twit logo.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.520]   Folks at Lalabod and Arc-Typ, who did our website.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.640]   You can see how you can go on and on.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.600]   We couldn't do this without all of you.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.920]   All of you who've donated, all of the folks who have helped
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.920]   with both money and contributions and other kinds.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.560]   And also to our agency pod track, who helped sell the Del
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.240]   and T-Mobile and Visa commercials.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.360]   Altogether, it's really been a group effort.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.080]   Have a great Christmas, a happy new year.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.560]   We'll be back in 2007 with many more Twits to come.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.880]   So here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.200]   Where the hell are we, David Prager?
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.120]   Right now we are at the 21st Amendment bar, which
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.960]   is about mere four or five blocks from the Moskone Center
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.640]   where Macklewood just kicked off early this morning for 2005.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.520]   And who's that?
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.560]   It's Patrick Norton.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.440]   I have no iPod shuffle, but I'm buying a Mac Mini as soon
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.880]   as I can get to an Apple story.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.920]   Yeah, I am.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.880]   And what does your lovely wife, Sarah, say about that?
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.240]   He can have the Mac Mini, but he can't have the shuffle.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   Sorry, not happening.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.800]   But the shuffle is so cool.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, their first fight
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   live on podcast.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.720]   So Sarah told me that it was either the couch or the Mac
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.220]   Mini.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.600]   So which is it, Sarah?
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.240]   Couch Mac Mini.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.280]   We'll just take every single PC tower we own,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.760]   and we will build this glorious couch.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.040]   It'll look like something out of ready-made magazines.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.480]   Do you really have a bagel?
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.600]   Hey, we want to make a big announcement here, don't we?
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.040]   I think we have a big announcement to make.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   Go ahead.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.200]   They're all looking at me.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.400]   David Prager is pregnant.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.200]   No, no, no, that's not it.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.400]   Oh, yeah, we were thinking that maybe we should--
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   We were thinking of web ring?
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.240]   Is that what you were asking?
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.520]   Yeah, well, this is a web ring.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.560]   That's kind of trivializing.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.080]   But I think we should do some sort of alliance of former tech
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.960]   TV people.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.600]   It's not really a syndication of content.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.320]   It's an aggregation of contact from very select few sources
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.400]   that we have a lot of trust and belief in.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.160]   And we know that--
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.360]   How would you like to be the VP marketing?
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.360]   He just got the job.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.880]   He sounds like he's a marketing guy, doesn't he?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.360]   He just--
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   He just--
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   He just--
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   He just--
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   I think he does the name.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   --fun, the announcement.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   That's funny.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   He's the spin doggy.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.280]   This is a slate revenge of the script of April 17, number one.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   Take one.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.280]   Cut the chit.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   So, yeah.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   You know, I don't know exactly what this show,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.200]   this Revenge of the Screen Saverz is going to be.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.240]   I mean, it's fun just to sit around and talk.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.680]   And I'd love to invite more people.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.600]   Right now, we're using Skype to do it, which seems to work fine.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.120]   I mean, we've got four people.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.480]   The quality's good, you know.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.640]   Is it secret that you do dig or is that known?
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.800]   It's pretty much known.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.640]   I'm a fan.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.480]   Well, I appreciate it.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.160]   Dig, for those who don't know, is one better than Slash Top
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.840]   because instead of some random taco editing it,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.040]   the humans who use it, who read it,
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.640]   choose what stories float to the top.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.160]   Exactly.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.520]   As more and more people have joined Dig,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.680]   it's become really better.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.760]   But I use it as part of my news beat check
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.560]   because I get the most interesting stuff that
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.000]   doesn't show up anywhere else on there.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.800]   Yeah, it's a lot of it's kind of off-eat stuff,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.960]   but it's cool like that.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.320]   And there's some articles I find out
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.680]   that I haven't seen anywhere else.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.240]   DIGG.com.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.040]   Hope you'll tune in then.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.720]   Thanks to Wayne and Wax at waneandwax.com
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.320]   for our theme.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.320]   Have a great week.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.160]   We'll see you later.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.400]   Wayne and Wax on the beat.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.600]   So I did that.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.880]   And any of these things, we get it that.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.560]   Welcome to the return of the [BLEEP]
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.040]   episode 2, April 24, 2005.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:53.000]   We got to come up--
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.160]   --to vary vocal 1%.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah, they are.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.720]   I got a cease and desist letter from G4 saying,
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.040]   you can't use the name of the screen.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.920]   This bleep.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.080]   So somebody suggested that we should call this
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.160]   the revenge of these green saviors.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.040]   What do you think?
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.720]   No?
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.280]   No.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.760]   OK.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.480]   No.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.560]   So anyway, I got this letter.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.360]   So what are we going to call this darn thing?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.520]   I'd say we sent to the users.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.560]   Let them come up with the name.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.880]   All right.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.760]   We should have a contest.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.480]   All right.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.600]   We'll have a contest.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.360]   And what will the prize be?
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.320]   The glory of having me--
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.040]   I will send them a box of stuff I'm clearing out of my garage.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.000]   I like it.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.960]   It's a surprise package.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   What's in Patrick's garage?
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.880]   Find out for yourself at gmail.com.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.160]   Send us your submissions.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.160]   In the subject line.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160]   In the subject line.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.600]   Good thinking, Kevin.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.840]   You've done this before.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   For the name of this dang show.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.000]   And we will consider it in the box of Patrick's old crap.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.120]   We'll go to the winner.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.000]   Once upon a time, there were three little girls
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.680]   who went to the police academy.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.640]   They were assigned very hazardous duties.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:04.280]   But I took them away from all that.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.880]   And now they work for me.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.480]   My name is John.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:16.920]   Hello, angels.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.560]   This is Leo, the port welcoming you
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.600]   to the last edition of the return of this [BLEEP]
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.080]   Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Norton,
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.840]   Kevin Rose, Robert Herron, and from Beyond the Grave,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.480]   John C. Devorek.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.760]   And this, the last edition of the return of the [BLEEP]
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.880]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.840]   We got a lot of good suggestions for the show name.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.480]   But one of the ones I liked the best Patrick was Sledgecast.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.880]   Nice.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.680]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   It's a Sledgecast.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.600]   We are going to unveil on the podcast this week our new name.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.400]   We got so many creative, clever submissions.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   You want to hear some of the names that people sent in?
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   Absolutely.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.680]   Al Hill said, "Saved by the Geeks."
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.720]   That's kind of keeping the screensavers ID.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.040]   If I could number people did that,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.360]   Claudia Flores said, "WwSSD, what would the screensavers do?"
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.480]   There was also a G4 eats as young,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.880]   but in a deference to G4, we'll leave that one out.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.600]   Kurt also suggested this week in geek, which
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.880]   is the closest to the one where I think I actually use.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.440]   What do you think of this week in geek?
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.520]   That's not bad at all.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.120]   We could call it geek week.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.640]   Twig.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.240]   Yeah, T-W-I-G.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.120]   I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that we're going to--
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.000]   I think we're going to go.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.440]   Robert, you weren't in on this conversation
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.680]   because you were busy finding headsets.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.040]   But I think we're going to go with the boring this week
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.200]   in tech, T-W-I-T.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.720]   And the only reason is I think the podcast has to say in its name
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.000]   what it is because otherwise, when people look at it
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.520]   in the directory, they'll have no clue.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.520]   Is that so boring that we should just say no?
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.360]   Oh, thanks for backing me up, guys.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.320]   Dead silence.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.200]   I think the Skype just faded out again.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.960]   Oh, it's the Skype problem.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.760]   Same here, Leo.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.240]   Same here.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.520]   You couldn't hear a word I was saying.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.280]   It's on spots.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.440]   So I've registered twit.tv.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.800]   We are all twits now.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   Twit.tv will be the domain.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.600]   Real quickly, I just want to mention
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.360]   we've decided not to take advertising, at least
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.800]   for the time being on the show.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.200]   We want to support the show, and there
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.520]   are costs associated with it.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.520]   So we thought it would be better if we
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.080]   asked for your support, your donations.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.000]   I want the podcast to be free and always free.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.880]   I think we all agree it's going to be that way.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.560]   It'll never be a subscription podcast.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.120]   However, we wouldn't mind if you subscribed as a way of donating.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.400]   So what I've set up is three buttons
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.200]   on the podcast page and on the feed for your choice.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   Not required.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.040]   Podcast is free.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.960]   But if you'd like to support the podcast,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   you can subscribe for $2 a month in a recurring subscription.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   Now, that's less than a latte a month.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.400]   Less than 50 cents a show.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.680]   We see less of it because, of course, PayPal takes its cut,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.760]   I think 36 cents.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.640]   But I wanted to make it small so everybody could participate.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.680]   The Windows Hardware Engineering Conference
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.480]   was this week.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.720]   Bill Gates revealed some details of Longhorn.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.440]   And I know Patrick extreme tech,
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.640]   a sense of people up there.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.200]   Yeah, actually, Lord Case was up there.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.080]   And I'm sure a couple of the other guys.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.680]   Boy, it's got the softest hair of anybody in the showbiz,
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.040]   by the way.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.600]   I just want to mention it.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.040]   I'm going to take your word.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.920]   I'm going to tell them that we're touching it.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.640]   Really nice hair.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.400]   Go ahead.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:15.920]   Sorry.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.360]   I have a vision of you petting his hair.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.480]   I haven't petted your hair.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.160]   You pet me out.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.120]   You used to pet me all the time.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.720]   Well, because your hair is magnificent.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.040]   It's like everybody thought it was fakely.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.440]   That's why we all had to check to see if it was fake or not.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.200]   Was that why everybody was touching me?
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.960]   It was just to see if I was wearing a wig.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.440]   That's a good bit badger.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.320]   It could be the man who's hair.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.240]   But if it's fake, it's glued on really, really well.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.960]   I don't have Ted Koppel here.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.120]   I think my hair looks like real hair, doesn't it?
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.480]   You have a magnificent pipe.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.640]   I paid a lot of money for this hair.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.760]   So the Longhorn beta was released,
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.840]   and everybody made fun of it.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.040]   Avalon looks pretty cool.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.440]   That's the graphics layer that's
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.080]   going to replace DirectX.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.120]   And other than that, they yanked a lot
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.520]   of the really interesting stuff that
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.720]   was supposed to go in the long haul.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.680]   No WinFS, the file system.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.160]   That's gone.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.960]   Well, they're going to release that afterward.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.600]   Yeah, 2008, or something.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.880]   What else did they yank out?
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.080]   I mean, some people are starting to call it Service Pack 3.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.200]   So Bill did speak, and he said that even though Longhorn
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.360]   will run on existing hardware, it won't run beautifully
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.240]   if you really want Avalon and all this--
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.040]   if you really want the animated icons, which I know
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.480]   I look forward to, and the transparency on the desktop,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.120]   you're going to want a 3 gigahertz processor
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.200]   and a pretty hefty video card.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.640]   But at this point, by the time it actually ships--
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.680]   It's never done.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.440]   You know, that 3 gigahertz processor
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.320]   should be well down into the $100 range.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.000]   So meanwhile, while Microsoft's talking about vaporware,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.160]   Apple comes along on Friday with Tiger.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.600]   Did you upgrade to Tiger?
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.040]   Kevin, you've been using it for a while.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.360]   Yeah, I've been using it for a little while,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.080]   and I have to tell you, I'm getting more--
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.960]   I love it.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.160]   I really do.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.800]   Finally, for the longest time, I watched OS 10 from a distance,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.480]   and I thought, oh, that's cool.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.160]   I like that.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.720]   But I never really wanted to make the switch.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.600]   And with some of the features like Spotlight
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.440]   and some of the other new things,
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.160]   it's just-- it's making more and more sense.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.680]   What else do you like about it, Kevin?
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.880]   The conferencing with the eyesight is pretty amazing.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.040]   The fact that you can do three people now, the H.264 codec
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.280]   is just-- it's amazing.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.400]   I've been doing some comparisons for the different videos.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.240]   I've been taking portions of our video that we've shot
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.160]   and recompressed them with QuickTime 7 using the new H.264.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.120]   And it's creating better quality videos, the same bit rates,
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.240]   that I would typically have to bump up to get
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.120]   that type of quality.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.960]   Hold on just a second, because it looks like we've
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.560]   got a special guest stopping by.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.520]   Let me answer the phone and see if we can get him
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.840]   into the Skype conference here.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.960]   He's calling me from his Fortress of Solitude,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   high atop the Berkeley Hills.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, John C. de Vorek.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   Yay!
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.720]   Anyway, we don't need hecklers.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.080]   We got him.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.280]   Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, Robert Heron, all with us.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.320]   And John, I told John he could be the Bob Hope of the show.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.080]   Any time he wanted to stop by with his golf club,
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.120]   he's welcome.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.600]   Absolutely.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.840]   The question is, this thing is my Skype is--
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.120]   I guess cuts it off.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.920]   Oh, well, one thing you've got to do
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.480]   is turn everything off on the damn computer.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.840]   You're cutting off a little bit, actually, as you call it.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.600]   No, well.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.000]   That's-- now, John, you wrote three columns
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.720]   that we want to talk about today.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   One saying podcasting is no big deal.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.400]   One saying Skype is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.920]   And the most recent one saying, there hasn't
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.800]   been anything new in gaming since first person shooters
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.400]   were invented.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.520]   Do you want to pick one of those to address?
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.880]   Well, that's pretty good.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.440]   You're actually reading these once in a while.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.320]   You know why I read them?
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.720]   People send me irate mail thinking I have some sort of conduit
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.160]   to you saying, can you tell the Vorek he's full of shit?
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.320]   Yeah, they do that all the time.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.240]   They send it to my wife, too.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.080]   And I'm so hard to get a hold of.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.920]   I've only had the same email address in the past decade.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.080]   So Robert is a gamer.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.800]   Robert, you want to ask any questions in Mr.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.480]   Dvorak here?
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.400]   I thought some of the points were valid.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.880]   It was just when it comes to what everyone harps on in the gaming
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.560]   world, like a new title like Half Life 2.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.080]   I honestly didn't see Half Life 2 as really pushing anything.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.040]   There's a lot of sequels, but that's true in movies,
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.720]   it's true in books.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.800]   I mean, John, you've written a few sequels to your books.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.240]   Never.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.960]   No, I don't believe in them.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.480]   Really?
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.160]   Is that true?
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.040]   No, I think everything should be original one shot only.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.840]   You've never been a fan of recycling.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.360]   Go ahead.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.160]   You never did a second edition of any of your books?
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.520]   Well, yeah, but that was--
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.440]   Oh, yeah, we lost him.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.240]   I was too hard on him already.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.480]   Can you hear us, John?
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.320]   Oh, man.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.160]   OK, now everybody, when John comes back,
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.920]   let's be real nice to him, OK?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.960]   This is ironic, because the one thing that he liked in those three
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.000]   articles was Skype.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.160]   And it's the one thing that's not working for us right now.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   It's got to be on his end.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.960]   It's going to be about--
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.920]   We've been fine.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.440]   I got--
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.400]   Oh, you can hear me, John.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.320]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.800]   You know what, John?
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.920]   You could just type, and I'll read your answers into the podcast.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.000]   I think it's Windows.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.480]   Well--
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.800]   We were talking before we tried to get this working.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.880]   If-- John, I'll tell you what--
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.480]   Hang in there.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.040]   Maybe you get it working and show up.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.080]   Otherwise, just--
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.680]   He says the settings shut themselves off.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.920]   So maybe it's something weird going on with Skype.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.080]   You might want to try rebooting.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.560]   The Vorac says rebooting.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   Ha!
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.000]   You know, I still have my Devorac in a can recording
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.160]   that we used on the radio show.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.920]   I could probably just fill those in.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.200]   I have about 10 quotes from John.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.640]   I just play him random.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.440]   Hey, we'll get a good sound board program made up.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   Nice.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.440]   What?
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.440]   That's a good idea.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   I bet you it's out there.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   The problem is what?
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440]   There is one.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   John had no.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440]   I can think of his--
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   Is Joe Devorac in a can?
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440]   I don't think he'd let him out.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.640]   We have some questions for you guys if you'd like to answer them from our listeners.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.240]   This is something we'd like to start doing to get a little more interactivity into the
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   show.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.440]   Yeah, John says, do you think I'm spidering around five sites right now?
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   Do you think that's an issue?
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   Yes.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   Don't do anything else.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   You're killing your bandwidth.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.440]   What was I saying?
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.320]   Oh, if you want to ask a question, the best way to do it, email us.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.600]   This week in tech@gmail.com, record your question and we'll play them back on the show.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.840]   And our panel of experts will answer them.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   You're potted up, John.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.680]   You can say anything you want, but we just can't hear you.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.000]   John says, can you hear me?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.720]   Because I know John, John's just, you know, this is torture for John.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.320]   For us to be talking about this.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   Totally.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.120]   John can't get a word in.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   Go ahead.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.120]   Try talking, John.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.120]   We're listening.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.120]   We're listening for the Twits here.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.560]   Hey, Leo, Patrick, Kevin, Robert Henry, Yoshi, whoever's there.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:23.520]   Anyway, my question basically is Kevin Rose, you have a Mac, meaning did you ever do any
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.800]   kind of like video editing?
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.560]   I know it's kind of, you know, only on one point something gigahertz process or but I
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.720]   mean, how is it?
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   What tiger on it?
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.280]   And I like faux five.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.240]   I mean, how does it hold up?
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   Is it worth it?
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.600]   Or is it worth me going to Mac?
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.800]   All these guys are asking Matt questions.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.200]   What's the problem here?
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.880]   You know, as far as video editing is concerned, I really wouldn't recommend going with the
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.000]   mini just because the hard drive is only a 5,400 RPM hard drive.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.640]   You're going to have a little bit if you're looking to do something with a little more
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.120]   production value, we're actually going to have to sit there and render out frames.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.840]   You probably want to beef it up a little bit and go with at least a low end G5.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.080]   My editor Keith in the background is yelling at me not to not to recommend it.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.640]   He's a premier pro type of guy.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.200]   So just stick with the PC and Windows and get premier pro.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.400]   Well, I have to say that.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.200]   The premier pro is just like an editing system, only harder.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.680]   I like it.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.080]   Premier pro is nice.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.320]   Dvorak says premier pro sucks and the caller sounds like a mass murderer.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.600]   I agree with that one.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.000]   This weekend tech, episode four May 8th, 2005.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.080]   And it looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon sport on this the 127th.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.720]   Up on class, quit of the year, chef.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.440]   Another something completely different.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.000]   We are all Twitch now.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:44.560]   All of you who have subscribed by the way, and I'm very happy to say that we had our 1,000th
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.440]   subscriber in less than a week, 1,000th subscriber was on Saturday and it was Joseph
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.700]   Jan of San Diego, California.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.800]   Thank you to everyone who subscribed.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.440]   And we thought we'd honor Joseph as our 1,000th.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:02.240]   We're going to give him a total bit headphone amp from headroom.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.240]   Did you see this article?
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.000]   Malicious applets can install dashboard widgets on Tiger, malicious web pages.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.760]   You can go there and they'll install these new dashboard widgets.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.760]   That could be a problem.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:19.000]   But this is a huge hole that Apple just basically installed on everybody's system.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.880]   If you go, I'll put a, there's a link on slash dot, stephen.com/widges/zaptastic.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.280]   If you go there on a Macintosh, it installs the widget and just did it on my system.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.720]   And the thing is the way widgets work.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   It's pretty up.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.200]   They are installed automatically.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.400]   Now this one's not malicious, but it's a good demonstration of the fact that it works.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.160]   So what if this widget, the icon of it is a casino or a porn site and you click on it
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.240]   and it brings you to the porn site?
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.880]   I mean, that's spyware.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.560]   That's exactly what's happening on the Windows site that's spyware.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.800]   I think Apple's got to fix it.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.240]   You guys know there's a couple of big Google stories in the news.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.560]   One, Google was down yesterday for about four hours and for a while it was being referred
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.680]   to as a site, SOGO site, which is apparently a New York marketing for Apple.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.000]   It's a site that has Google.net.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.720]   I say, or no, google.com.net.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   I think they own it.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.760]   Google says it wasn't a hack.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.920]   It was a DNS error, but I was shocked to go to Google and get a 404 is shocking.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   Don't you think?
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.000]   That's pretty scary.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.680]   I felt like I couldn't, I felt a debilitated.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.240]   I can't use the net.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.040]   The broadcast flag.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   It's over.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.040]   The broadcast flag is dead.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   Wow.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.360]   Is the XCC going to appeal that decision?
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   You bet.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   I'm sure they're going all the way to the Supreme Court.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   You don't think so?
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   They'll lie down?
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.520]   Not at all.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.240]   They want to outlaw every piece of hardware that's been sold.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:41.360]   I guess it would not law what you currently own, but suddenly every broad, every receiver
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.920]   out there that could accept say, and over the Air HD signal, you're going to suddenly
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.640]   make that illegal even owned or resell in some way.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.280]   You have to put it unless it has copy and protection built in.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.120]   It has to have the broadcast flag or it's illegal.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.400]   Right, but everything up to this point, especially on the PC side, just simply ignores
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   the broadcast flag.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   It ignores it outright.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:05.080]   I just think the SCC is how can we possibly go back at this point after we've let it out
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.080]   of the box?
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.920]   The cable industry association meeting a couple of weeks ago, one of the engineers
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.600]   on the download just said, "You know what?
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.040]   Even Microsoft has fully acknowledged that every piece of video technology they have out
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.960]   there can be cracked."
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.760]   They expect it not simply if, but when.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.760]   Yay!
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.400]   Thanks, the gentlemen.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.440]   It's the Mod Master himself.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.000]   What you've been up to these days, Yoshi?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   We miss you.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.040]   I'm actually, I'll announce it on air here.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.240]   I am getting married soon and I seem to be a father.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.000]   Oh, congratulations!
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Whoa!
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.120]   Yeah, Yoshi, that's great!
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.000]   So can you tell us who the lucky lady is?
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.600]   You want to, don't say her whole name and we don't want to expose her too quickly to
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   this story?
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   That's great.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600]   Congratulations to you, Yoshi.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   You've been pretty much the best thing that's ever happened.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600]   So, pretty cool.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   Well, Yoshi, that's...
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.800]   And everyone that's around me has told me that they've seen a visible change in me.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.320]   They've seen it around.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:06.400]   As all of us here will testify, there's nothing like a good woman to tame a bad man.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.120]   I sound like a Johnny Cash selling, isn't it?
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.240]   I want to mention that Megan was going to join us.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.880]   Megan Moroni, another longtime friend of ours and a screensaver and it is Mother's Day,
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.760]   her mother's in town so she couldn't make it, but she'll come in sometime soon.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.520]   You know she had twin boys a month ago.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.760]   I had dinner with her on Friday night, she and her husband and the three kids.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.640]   They had an instant family, came over and it was so great and her mom too.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   So she wishes you all the best.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.040]   She's just doing great.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.000]   She's very happy and we expect to get her in here doing the show very soon.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.720]   We might be able to kind of recreate the screensavers.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   I mean the...
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.360]   I think one by one will drag them back in.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.120]   That show we used to do.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.120]   Let's take some questions.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.360]   You're going to have to bleep that, Leo.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.040]   Dum bleep it, damn it.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.040]   Let's take...
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.040]   I got to bleep that too.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   I got to bleep that.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.880]   Never ending and that too and that.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.000]   Yeah, I mean this is just for the Twitcast but it's a central location where people can
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   find out more.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   If you want to eat...
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   You like that Twitcast?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   You can stay Twitcast.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Forget podcast.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.840]   The future of radio is Twitcast.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.840]   It is a Twitcast.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.840]   What do you think?
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   No, I got it.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.160]   I recorded it in two different ways so I think we have a Twitcast.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   Here we have a Twitcast.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.160]   [Music]
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   [Music]
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   Episode number five.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   For May 15th, 2005.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.960]   All right, who watched MTV Thursday night?
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.560]   For the big Xbox 360?
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.560]   So, what do you think?
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.560]   I was not impressed.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   No, wait a minute.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:52.360]   The power PC processors, a 500 MHz ATI processor, 20 gig hard drive.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.640]   It's going to be the most powerful computer in your house, isn't it?
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.840]   Until the PS3 comes out.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.320]   I was impressed when I saw the spec sheet.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.160]   The games that they've shown, the little clips that they've shown so far don't really
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.200]   look all that impressive to me yet.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.800]   But you know, that's just the way it is.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.360]   Anytime a new console comes out, the games obviously don't take full potential of all
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.640]   the hardware that's available.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.920]   So we'll have to wait a while until we really see some cool games coming out for it.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.280]   I like the way that they're actually going to be tying into some things like music stores
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.440]   so you can download music.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.240]   They're actually making this device for the hacked Xboxes are now.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.000]   So in other words, they're giving it media capabilities.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.360]   You can run music and pictures and all that stuff.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.480]   Has anybody been following the NBA announcement that they're suing?
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.240]   Yeah, they put to be taking action again.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240]   Television show V.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.920]   Yeah, they put BTEF net off.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.720]   About six or seven trackers are gone now.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   And it wins.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   It's going to hit stuff like that one video or services like that that are like, oh, you'll
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   get all your sites.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.200]   You want it automatically minds up for you.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   So they're seeing that there's a lot of activity there.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.320]   But I think they should really see the positive side of that.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.520]   You exploited as a promotional tool.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.400]   Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing with music for me.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.240]   Sometimes I'll download music that I didn't pay for and I'll enjoy it and then go out and
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.480]   buy the CD or buy the CD online.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.840]   You got to talk to these guys and you'll realize that they see blood.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.000]   They're furious.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   It's not.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.400]   It's an emotional reaction.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.600]   It's not a rational business decision.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.720]   The record industry and the movie industry are livid and you try to talk to them.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.560]   They say, but they're stealing our stuff.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.080]   They turn red in the face.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.720]   Smoke comes out of their ears.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.760]   They're not thinking long term by any means.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.440]   With all the MP3 downloads, the Napsters and whatnot, it didn't really affect the sales
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   of CDs.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.920]   I mean, they tried to say that it hurt them and hurt them and hurt them and yet the CD
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   sales still went up.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.080]   In fact, I think you can make a good case that it's just promotional.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.880]   It has a promotional value.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.280]   From what you've heard is, is 1080p, is that going to be H.G.D. or Blu-ray?
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.920]   Are they going to actually offer 1080p DVDs to buy purchase?
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.560]   Nothing yet from the movie studios.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.600]   They're still focused on 720p 1080i.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.240]   Let me let's get a question in from one of our Twitter listeners.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   Hey everyone.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.960]   I'm Jonathan from New York City.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:05.480]   I just have a question about the standards for between Blu-ray and high definition DVD.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:13.120]   Do you think that there will be a chance or an opportunity to say that both standards
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.880]   might unify into one?
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.240]   There's talks of the HD DVD and the Blu-ray converging and then Toshiba denied it and
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.280]   then they announced their new triple layer HD DVD.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.200]   It's up to 45 gigabytes now.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.280]   I don't see that as a convergent step.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   You're going to have universal players.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.280]   Can you do that?
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   Oh yeah.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   I mean, yes.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.280]   They showed off two and three pickup systems.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.280]   What about the latest?
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   The same box.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.320]   Well, it's got to be much more expensive and complex.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.960]   You only have once it's built.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.800]   As all the engineers say, you build it once.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   That's the expensive part.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.080]   As soon as it's built, they tape them out at cheaper and cheaper costs.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   They can do it all.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.480]   They're going to have the multi-format drives because there's no way Sony is going to suddenly
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.720]   say, "Oh, let's just join forces and co-create a new format."
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   All right.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.760]   I'm going to do my best Bill Gates impression now.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.560]   I don't think the success of the iPod can continue in the long term.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.320]   However, good Apple may be.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.120]   I think you can draw parallels here with the computer.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.960]   There too, Apple was once extremely strong with its Macintosh and graphic user interface.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.800]   Like with the iPod today, then lost its position.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   Sour grapes?
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.280]   Well, this is the same person who said they'll never need more than 120K memory.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   I have that somewhere.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   I'll play that for you.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.480]   I think it wasn't even that.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   It was 640K.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.400]   It was like, "You'll never need more than 640 kilobytes of anybody.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.880]   We'll never need more than that."
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.280]   Well, I mean, it's only a matter of time.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.520]   With the latest release of iTunes 4.8, they've added the ability to play videos and download
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.520]   video content.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.600]   There are certain albums when you buy them now, they actually come bundled with video.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.520]   It's only a matter of time before they add a portable little handheld player that plays
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.520]   videos as well.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.160]   Apple will do better than anybody else, and that will be the new rage, and everyone will
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   have one of those.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.000]   Steve doesn't think people will want to watch portable video.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.360]   Now, Steve could change his mind.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.040]   I think there is probably a good reason.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   What's this deal with?
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.040]   Steve also said that they weren't going to have a flash-based iPod.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.040]   Right.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   And then came out with one.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.240]   Yeah, better to be a pirate than joining an avian.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.320]   They took over the Macintosh project in the Dark Apple campus.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.600]   Steve also told me I was a lousy spiker, but that's another man in town.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   So what's this?
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   Right.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   You played volleyball with him, didn't you?
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   I did.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.280]   This is my one good story in my whole life.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.360]   And he's very competitive.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.920]   I was on his team, and I didn't play well enough, I think.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.440]   Another question from the Twit.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.360]   Now, we're the Twits, right?
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   What are we going to call the Twit listeners?
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.360]   The Twit Army.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.920]   The Twit Army.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, how about you, Yoshi?
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.960]   Are you still building PCs?
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.680]   I haven't built a new one lately.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   I'm still using-- I mean, I'm running Linux as an OS, but I'm running PCs.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.080]   I have one that's sitting idle, gets some more hardware for, but I'm running 6800 Ultra.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.160]   I haven't tried one of the new 512 Ultra's.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.280]   I'm a big AMD fan, though, as far as CPU's.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.680]   I still think for the money, they're the best CPU.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.480]   I think we're all in agreement on that.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.320]   Anybody think they'd rather have a Pentium 4, a Prescott?
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.640]   Well, last four systems.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.400]   I know we're AMD 64s, and they're all awesome.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.120]   Anything exciting coming down the pipe?
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   Anybody have any expectations?
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.160]   I just want a new version of the Raven or A-
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   A new version of system.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.160]   A new version of system.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   Oh, it's coming out.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.600]   Yes, it's coming out one week from Monday.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   Oh.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.320]   It's going to be a device that we built from the ground up.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.600]   It's a custom circuit that we created to do something that's never been done before.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   Holy cow.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   I have another major announcement.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.000]   We'll announce here on Twit next week.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.960]   That has nothing to do with that, but is being used.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:29.360]   So let's take a look though at the top stories of the week starting off with Steve Ballmer.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.680]   Gives an interview in Business Week in which he says, "Google, ah, they're a one hit wonder."
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.800]   Yoshi, what's going on with Google and China?
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.920]   They're opening offices over there because they like Yahoo!
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   Move over there.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.880]   They want to move their search market into China.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   Yahoo!
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.960]   Actually agreed to censor the results.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.760]   Now there's talk of will Google do the same?
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.840]   A lot of people are really kind of going, "Hey, Google's like, it's like the press.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.240]   They want freedom information.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.720]   They don't want them to say which information you can get."
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.880]   That's like an ethical thing.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.520]   Is it right to censor the results?
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.400]   But China could say, "No, if you don't do it, we're not going to let you in."
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.000]   My feeling is, I think Google should say, "Then fine, don't let us in."
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.880]   It's the biggest market in the world though, isn't it?
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.840]   I mean, billions of people.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.080]   It comes down to, is there a company about the ethics and the information they provided
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.360]   and the reason why people like Google is because you can get a lot of good information?
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   Or is it just a matter of making a buck?
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.720]   Has anybody used a new Google portal?
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   I started playing with it.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   I like it a lot.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.040]   It's really cool.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.040]   It's real simple.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.600]   The thing I like is, as you say, it's simpler, so it doesn't clog up your page.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.600]   But it's got news.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.360]   You're going to have slash dotters at times or wired news of the BBC or Google news.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.400]   My favorite thing is you can drag them around live, which you can't do on Yahoo.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.280]   So you can rearrange your page, just drag it around.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   That's so slick.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   It is.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.440]   I have it as my home page now.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440]   Yeah, me too.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.760]   Yahoo announced this week that Yahoo will have music.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.880]   We'll have unlimited downloads for $5 a month, $4.99 when you sign up for a year.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   Mark Cuban said that, well, if you get an unlimited number of legal music downloads,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.920]   that means the RIAA can no longer sue anybody for more than $5 per month.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.240]   They were violating peer-to-peer file trading because obviously the value of the music of
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.120]   an unlimited amount of music is $5 per month indefinitely.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.600]   Now the issue, of course, the issue-- and I ask the lawyer about this, and you're right
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.600]   that the compensatory damages are now effectively $5 a month because that's how much it's worth.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.080]   But they still go for statutory damages and punitive damages.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.640]   So you could-- this doesn't let you off the hook.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.120]   What it means-- and this explains why the record companies in the movie industry go to
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.280]   Congress with bags of money because they need there to be statutory penalties so that they
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.320]   can get some-- you know, these lawsuits carry some weight.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.240]   Yeah, you don't want to go to prison for that, man.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   They really treat you poorly.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.760]   Oh, he's a file trader.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.760]   Go get him.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.040]   Predictions for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.760]   Next month, WVDC, I think Apple's going to pull a switch.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.920]   I think Apple has to do a subscription model now on iTunes Music Store.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.400]   I think they're going to-- in order to do that, they have to announce new iPods.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.320]   I think they will, and I think they may well do a video iPod this next month.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   What do you think?
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.240]   I guarantee they're releasing a video iPod.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.600]   I don't think they're doing it next month.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.560]   I'd be surprised if they're not quick, but maybe August and Macworld.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.720]   A lot of people are saying that the next iPod major development is going to be wireless
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.320]   headphones, which I've heard from two or three different directions.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:20.320]   But a lot of people who are saying that Steve is still really, really down on creating
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.520]   a video iPod.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.400]   And a lot of people don't think that there's the cooperation there from the motion picture
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.480]   studios.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.680]   So it'll be interesting to see what they come up with.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.520]   This is what I think-- Microsoft's just kind of on the offensive.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.840]   And I mean, they're offensive.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.200]   You get bombers saying Google's a one-hit wonder a couple of weeks ago.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.560]   You got Gates saying the iPod's a one-hit wonder.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.960]   I think they're just-- this is wishful thinking at this point.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.920]   And their new Xbox is a big friend to the iPod.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.920]   Good point.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   Hey, you know what?
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.480]   It's time to get our E3 roundup from a Roger Chang.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.080]   So David, that means I'm going to put you out to past here.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.080]   What are you doing these days?
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.360]   You're still at the G4, yes?
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:06.360]   Yeah, still working there on the current incarnation of screen savers.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.360]   Attack of the show.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.360]   Attack of the show.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.360]   Now one more time.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.360]   Pranger!
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.360]   Pranger!
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   He's turning into a pretty darn good producer.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.640]   I mean, he's the guy who arranged the web server up the guy's colorectal area.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.160]   He booked the surgeon and everything.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.560]   I mean, that's, you know.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.480]   There's Roger Chang, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   Roger, welcome.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.880]   Okay, we're going to say you're working at where you're working, but you do not represent
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.880]   them.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.720]   Yes, I work currently for GameSpot, the Division of CNET.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.520]   It was a very good show.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.520]   You know, a lot of people--
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:43.320]   All the mainstream media obviously covered the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.680]   Microsoft basically went out of the gate with the MTV show that they did.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.960]   But I think they were trying to get the attention before E3.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   Exactly.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.880]   Because they were afraid of what Sony's PlayStation 3 announcement would look like.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.520]   And I think they did get scooped.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520]   And you know what?
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.520]   I really feel sorry for Nintendo.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.320]   It's interesting because Nintendo really didn't have that much compared to the other--
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.720]   They announced a handheld and a console.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.680]   Well, they announced a lot of errors.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.320]   But they didn't have any attention for it.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.920]   They basically announced something they did not have yet.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.120]   They announced the Nintendo Revolution, which if you've seen pictures of the USA today for
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.160]   that-- I think it was Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   It looks like a broadband modem on its side.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.920]   So which is the better machine?
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:33.600]   Is it the 3.2 GHz, 3 3.2 GHz power PCs plus a 500 MHz ATI in the Xbox 360 or the cell
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.840]   processor running at 3 plus GHz in the PlayStation 3?
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840]   How do you decide?
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.720]   I mean, they're different architectures.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:46.560]   I mean, you have a multi-core G5 and one that you have not only a power PC derivative,
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   but basically entirely new cell.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.800]   No one's ever kind of seen that before in a home entertainment device.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.360]   The expectations are high.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.880]   But the expectations high were for the PS2 when they announced the emotion engine.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.400]   Everyone was expecting to be bold over.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.680]   And when it came out, people were developers having-- the first games are always going to
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.080]   be kind of a little shotted because developers haven't had time to exploit the power.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   It's been what?
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   Four, five years later.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.360]   The first year of the PS2, it took them to figure out how to program it.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   It was so hard to know.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   It was hard to know.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.360]   The game's got spectacular.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.600]   And that's where Microsoft is trying-- I think they're trying to leverage is like, hey,
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.240]   we have a tangible product that you can touch that will work.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.000]   When is the Xbox 360 hit the--?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.360]   It's supposed to come out this fall basically in time for the holiday shopping season.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.560]   And it's not till March of next year for the PlayStation 3.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.800]   You know, it remains to be seen if what the price went for the PS3 will be.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.840]   Most people are probably speculating around 300 bucks because any more than that, you're
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.960]   going to price yourself out of the market.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.680]   I'm going to make you spend money, guys.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.800]   Imaginary money on imaginary game consoles.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.280]   Robert Herron, PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360?
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.280]   PlayStation 3.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   Yoshi, Xbox.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.760]   How about you, Roger?
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.800]   Xbox, just because it supports-- it will act as a Windows Media extender.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.360]   Patrick, Xbox or PlayStation 3?
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   Oh, boy.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.840]   I think it's going to be the PS3.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.600]   All right, so I've got two PS3s, two Xboxes.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.760]   I'm going to break the tie.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.760]   It's Xbox.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.600]   But I might get a PS3 too if you guys look that good.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.760]   Question from Dorothy.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.960]   This is the woman who, by the way, designed our little twit that's on our web page.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.360]   I love that little twit guy.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.360]   How do you--?
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.360]   Isn't he cute?
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   I think-- yeah.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.520]   When he's on his side, I think that's an electrical symbol for-- she told me it was like an inducer
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   or something.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.880]   Just turn him around and he's a little guy.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.720]   So thank you, Dorothy.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.040]   Here we are at the beautiful KitKat Club in downtown Toronto.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.920]   I'm sitting across from Screenstar Kevin Rhodes.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.040]   He's the babe toy magnet-- or the toy babe magnet.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.840]   I'm talking about it.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.360]   Then all the girls go for the king of the dark tip, Kevin.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.840]   Tell your loving and doring audience what is it this big announcement that you can't
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   be on the twit for?
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.840]   What's going on?
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.480]   So the big announcement is that I'm leaving G4.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   What?
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.480]   Yes.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   Can't leave G4.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480]   It's true.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   Are they firing you?
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.480]   No, they actually--
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   Tell us the truth.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   It's OK.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.480]   You can tell us from my friends.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.320]   The truth is I've been in negotiation with them for the last-- negotiations with them for
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.200]   the last probably close to a month now to get out of my contract.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   Really?
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   So what's the deal?
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.440]   Well, the deal is I really want to do my own thing.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.120]   It's like I've-- for the longest time now, it feels that I've just been doing content
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.760]   that I'm not happy with or haven't been able to get as really geeky as I want to get
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   with the content.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.760]   Right.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.160]   And I miss a lot of the old screen savers days and I just want to get out there and produce
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.840]   and create really solid downloadable tech content for the web.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.360]   And the only way to do it is to actually have some time to do it and that's to get out of
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   my contract with G4.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.200]   I'll tell you, this Twitcast is really becoming the venue for big announcements.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.560]   Yoshi announcing his impending wedding and baby and--
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   Roger.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.360]   Are you trying to compare with either one of those?
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.640]   I thought you were getting the sex change operation.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.240]   Anything you want to tell people about?
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:59.680]   Not to my knowledge, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.120]   Yoshi said something-- Yoshi said speaking of sex, I've got to hear this sentence.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.120]   Go ahead.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.960]   Hey, if you're a sex, I found out the sex of our baby is a boy.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   It's a boy!
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   That's a big announcement.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.960]   Yes, yes.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.080]   I've already got the URL.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.800]   It's a couple of years off, obviously, but I registered my first mod.com.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.840]   It's both of them.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.440]   Take episode 7, June 4, 2005.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.920]   Oh, I just got that 45-inch sharp aqua, son.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.160]   What a lovely, lovely display.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.160]   Nice.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160]   1080p.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.160]   1080p.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   45 inches?
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   How much?
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.160]   8 grand.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.160]   8-- well, that's not bad.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.240]   No, I mean, it's state of the art for what Sharp's doing right now and there aren't many
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.920]   displays you can buy right now that are-- I don't think there is one larger that is actually
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.920]   out on the market yet.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.480]   The cool new trend is with smaller flat panels, the 37-inch.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.400]   They're shooting at 37 inches with 1080p now and they're all for around 2 grand or less.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.400]   Can plasmids--
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   Are they doing any plasmids with that resolution?
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   Sure.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.200]   But it's up in the 70-plus inch range, which is $50,000 on up.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   OK.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.840]   So if you want 1080p and you're going to start seeing more and more 1080p, I'd be
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840]   deaf.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.200]   I'll see these the way to go.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is like the part in Wizard of Oz where it goes from black and
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.640]   white to color.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.720]   Patrick Knight Norton's about to go from Skype to high quality audio.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.680]   Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.680]   That's better.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.680]   Patrick, you're going to be mad at me.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.280]   I bought a tablet PC.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.960]   I'm not mad at you.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.960]   I'm laughing at you.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.960]   Here's the worst part.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.680]   Well, at least you're away from Tiger now.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   I kind of like it.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.560]   Do you using it to browse in the bathroom?
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.400]   Do you take it in the bathroom with you in the morning?
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.840]   Yeah, I think there needs to be a 12-step program for me for a tablet PC.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.840]   I can't stop using.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.080]   So you join on the screen all the time?
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.480]   Well, you know what I bought it for us for the TV show.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.680]   One of my sponsors on the radio show is a DSL provider.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.840]   The best announced that they are now offering normal DSL, you know, 1.5 megabit DSL for
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.480]   15 bucks a month.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.480]   I read that.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   Can you see it?
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.480]   For how long?
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.880]   Well, SBC's done it and so now everybody's dropping.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.880]   Can you believe?
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.000]   Is that for six months or is that indefinitely?
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   These guys, I don't know about SBCs, do I think SBCs a few months, but these guys are
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.560]   going to be for a year.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   15 bucks.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   That's great.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.960]   I really think we're just going to start to see big-time price wars in high-speed Internet.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.320]   I used to always like cable better.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.320]   I don't know.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   What do you have, Kevin?
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   Do you have DSLR cable?
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   Cable mode at home, but it's terrible.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   You have a Delphian?
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.320]   No, Comcast.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.600]   And there's too many people in the neighborhood?
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   In the afternoon.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.360]   Yeah, there's too many people.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   I'm on cable mode.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.200]   You like it?
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.720]   Robert, you said you like it or you don't like it?
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.320]   I think it just cut off on him.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.680]   So now it's cable.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.200]   That's the cable mode.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.680]   Here's the answer, right?
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:44.760]   So Kevin, big, big rollout for system last week, you want to tell the world what happened?
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.240]   It was just madness.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.560]   I can't believe what happened.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.080]   There was how many people were in the chat room, right?
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.040]   We got to 800 people in the IRC, but you couldn't do anything because we were being
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.320]   bothered the whole time.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.080]   However, I've never seen 800 people.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.240]   You know, it was like skiing.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.520]   The tech's gone by so fast.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.640]   You feel like it's like blurring.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.880]   You feel like you downhill skiing through text.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.880]   It was amazing.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.240]   Yeah, so basically we had a little get together.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.840]   There was probably about, I don't know, a Yoshua was there like 15 to 20 people or something
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.680]   like that?
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.240]   I mean, when we were there, there was over 800 people in the IRC and we were like, "Whoa!"
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.280]   Do you know how many downloads you got, Kevin?
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.400]   According to BitTorrent, it's a little over 60,000.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.400]   That's great.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.720]   We have obviously all the mirrors that were set up.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   And how big is the file?
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.400]   In between 50 to 150 megabytes.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:35.360]   So 60,000 times, let's say 100 megabytes is 6 terabytes.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   Is that right?
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.720]   Yeah, that's a lot of data.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.720]   Holy moly.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.520]   Jiminy Christmas.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   Good golly.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.440]   That's crazy.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.680]   Like megabytes, Batman.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.600]   Have you seen anybody see the new Batman?
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.240]   Batman begins or whatever it is.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.000]   It comes out the middle of the month.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.520]   Everybody's getting excited to say it's good.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.080]   Well, that 10 minute preview they showed at the end of Smallville, the season finale,
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.680]   it was awesome looking.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   I cannot wait.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.560]   That excites me far more than Star Wars did.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.520]   And they've really built a business around it, which is kind of neat.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.720]   Something I'll never be able to do because I don't have a head for that stuff.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.360]   But it looks like you're doing it, Kevin.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.360]   Yeah, we're trying to.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.320]   And we've put together a really good team and we're excited about Crankan as many episodes
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.880]   as we possibly can.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.480]   So if you go there with an unpatched computer, they run, what they run is PGP and they encrypt
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.240]   your document files with their password, right?
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.040]   And they leave a note in your hard drive saying, you want to get out of these files, it will
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.600]   be 200 bucks.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.680]   That's awesome.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.640]   That is really clever.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   That's just funny.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.080]   What's funny is that it's not one million dollars.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.280]   And they'll send me the young Russian women's spam.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.840]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.280]   First, you got to take the Viagra and the road game.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.280]   That's the key.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.320]   Did you hear about that Viagra's blinding people?
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   Do you think that's true?
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   I don't know.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   I don't know.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.400]   You'll go blind if you do that.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.400]   Oh, it's true.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.240]   Your mom was right.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.200]   You know who invested in Cialis.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.360]   You know Cialis is one of the competitors for Viagra.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.360]   Oh, Bill Gates.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.360]   Bill Gates.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.280]   Anybody that used the new BitTorrent search engine?
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.280]   Well, that's what they're doing.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.680]   It's called Trackerless Search.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.560]   The reason it's possible for the Motion Picture Association of America to go after the BitTorrent
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:18.560]   sites, the supernovas and the TV torrents and all that is because there's a tracker.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.640]   These guys don't stay up because who can fight deep pockets?
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.000]   You can't afford to fight it.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.720]   But the tracker sites aren't hosting any content.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.920]   I mean, there's nothing illegal on the tracker site.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.760]   It's just putting people together.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.920]   It's going to be interesting to see what happens because now that we're seeing tracklers
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.040]   because when it was tracked, they were still responsible because they were actually operating
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   the tracking servers.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.880]   So there's somebody you can go after.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.880]   Completely tracklers.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.040]   Well, you could still, if you could, look, if you're looking for Star Wars and you start
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.800]   downloading Star Wars, you can see the IP address of the guy you're getting it from, right?
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   Right.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   I mean, that's identifying them.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.880]   But that's even been addressed now.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.880]   I mean, on a slash dot this morning, there's a new BitTorrent replacement quote unquote
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.880]   called Rodey, which is written in Java and it actually includes full-anominity.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.720]   So you can basically use a third party to block your IP address.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.520]   There's no way to figure out who's doing what.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.480]   You could also, you know, there are tools out there to anonymize you.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.960]   I'm actually getting one to review and I'll let you know how it works.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:16.000]   There's a product called iFandom that is very slick, which gives you full anonymity.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.280]   This is a little box.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.320]   You would put it outside your router.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.800]   It's not doing that.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.160]   It filters all your traffic through their servers and their servers look for viruses
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.400]   spyware.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.680]   But also because you're going through their servers, it's an effect to proxy.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.160]   It's not a proxy, but it works like an anonymizing proxy.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.560]   You can see your IP address.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   This is iFandom.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   It's called iFandom.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.640]   I have a guest here I want you to talk to.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.240]   He's sitting right next to me, Mr. Dan Heward.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   Yeah!
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   It's Fufu.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.240]   Hey, Dan.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.720]   Hey, how are you doing?
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720]   Wow.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.720]   How are you doing, Dan?
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.720]   You're working on system full-time?
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.920]   Yeah, if you're so, yeah.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.880]   That's where the boss tells me.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.880]   You're getting a paycheck?
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   I think so.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.400]   It's on checks in the mail, isn't it?
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.480]   It's so great to talk to you.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.600]   On Mother's Day, I saw you come on IM, so I started typing.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.600]   It was your mom.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   Oh, yeah, my mom.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.600]   She came on.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.800]   She's all news about that.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   Very sweet.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.440]   We had a lovely conversation.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.840]   We've had a relationship with ThinkGeek for ages and ages two, and they want to do some
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.840]   merchandising.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.440]   And Jinx just does t-shirts, right?
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.800]   Yeah, they do do t-shirts.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.000]   So we'll give Jinx the t-shirt concession, but I want action figures, and we'll get ThinkGeek
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   to sell those, okay?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Sounds good.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.440]   Yoshi, you can have a lightsaber.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.440]   And your action figure.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.600]   I wanted the samurai sword.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   Okay, okay.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.120]   I want kung fu grip.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.880]   Okay, fufus kung fu.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.880]   Try to say that three times.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.880]   Fufus kung fu grip.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.880]   We'll call it the kung fu-fu grip.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.320]   On the screen that comes off my back.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.320]   My name's Dan.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   Dan doesn't like fufus.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.320]   You can't call that anymore.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.480]   It's too late, dude.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.560]   You are fufus.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   You are the fufus.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.040]   You know, big, long horn...
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   Are you ready?
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   The big, long horn announcement, right?
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.880]   They took out the file system.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.080]   They've taken out all anything good, but they do have a new feature.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.320]   They're gonna love and long horn.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.840]   No more my.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.760]   It's no more my music, my pictures, my folders, my network.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   None of that.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   It's not a computer.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.160]   It's just gonna be documents, music, pictures.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   No more my.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.160]   Amazing.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.160]   Wow.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.160]   That's a good point right there.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.400]   And for sure, that's awesome.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.320]   And how many years is this gonna push back development?
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.640]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.640]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.760]   By the way, it just picked up six months of development.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.040]   2007, yeah, sorry.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.040]   But no my.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.360]   It's gonna be worth it.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.280]   We didn't really get to talk about this last week, so let's talk about this week.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.160]   Pentium D, the dual core Pentium.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.960]   Going to the desktop, it's the end of the line for single core processors.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.240]   Then there's almost a performance improvement if you use a couple of obscure benchmarks.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.200]   Robert, you know, you've probably been following this closer than I have.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.760]   But I'm not seeing much that doesn't make me want to go for a much less expensive, you
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.680]   know, F on 64 compared to the Pentium D.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.480]   I was gonna say Intel who?
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.480]   Is Intel in trouble?
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   Is this it?
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.080]   Desktop CPUs, losing favor with the hardcore group.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   Definitely.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.680]   With AMD's X2 coming up, that is the most powerful processor you can buy.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.360]   But anyway, all our performance numbers for every, for video encoding, audio encoding,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.120]   gaming, everything just puts that chip at the forefront.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:20.960]   Yeah, well, I got a Pentium M. I mean, this type of this pad is a Pentium M. And I mean,
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.080]   that's a, that's the best laptop chip still, yes?
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.600]   Another reason I'm buying my IBM's.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.920]   I love IBM's notebook keyboards.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.720]   I'm nervous about the Lenovo takeover on IBM though.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.280]   Yeah, I mean, that's the Chinese government.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.120]   Speaking of governments, look what the, did you see what the MPAA announced today?
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:43.040]   Said they're putting up 10 surveillance cameras on the streets of LA to catch DVD pirates.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.120]   Can a private group put up surveillance cameras on the street?
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.640]   Is it even possible to know how much money they actually lose worldwide to piracy?
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.920]   But it's, it's kind of like funny because they're always doing really nickel and dime
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:59.000]   things because maybe the only place they can do them is inside the US.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.640]   Well, how much money are they spending trying to enforce all this stuff?
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.600]   Well, all the lawyers are already on retainer.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.480]   I wish they would just simply put that effort into creating more formats for us at better
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.880]   quality and cheaper prices.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.400]   And I think the problem would solve itself.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.280]   Sunday, June 5th, 2005.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.760]   Episode number eight.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.120]   Tomorrow, June 6th, Steve Jobs gets up on the stage at the World Wide Developer Conference.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.840]   And if the Wall Street Journal is to be believed, if seen it is to be believed, he will in
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.840]   the next few minutes.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:31.640]   The future max will not have power PC chips in them, but will have instead Intel chips.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.160]   That to me is a huge story.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.280]   Frankly, I've been saying this is the end of the world for Apple.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.800]   That Apple is, this is Apple shooting itself in the foot committing Harry Carrey.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.320]   It's Steve Jobs' ultimate act of arrogance.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.360]   And the first person I thought of to call was John C. de Vorek.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.840]   I actually use this technology.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:57.120]   They called a telephone and called John and I asked him what he thought about all this.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.960]   So you should make this sound dour.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.680]   I have just the opposite of take that you have on this.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.680]   I mean, you're making it sound like, first of all, let's go over this.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.440]   And I did have this in Britain up in 2003.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.840]   I expected it to happen last year in 2004 based on what I heard that was going on.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:17.000]   It's possible that it took longer to do the middleware part, which is going to be the
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.480]   things that allow some of the software to run on the new platform much the same way the
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.280]   Power PC made its transition.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.760]   I think this is going to be one of the greatest benefits for Apple that the company could
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.760]   ever imagine.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   Well, what do they stand again?
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.280]   Well, what they stand again, first of all, is they can bring out a standardized Intel
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.960]   platform running this OSX.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:44.440]   They can also manufacture standard PCs for people who want to maybe still use Windows,
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.520]   even though I think that there's maybe a swing toward OSX for Intel, or which I call a Mac
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.520]   Intel.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:54.880]   So you think they're going to make a dual boot system that runs both Windows and Apple?
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.600]   I think it's doable.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:01.120]   And I think also if I had a choice, I could say for most PC users, and I've just written
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.200]   this up for PC magazine, it'll be running tomorrow.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.640]   I think most of these computers that we have on our desk, the PC users, or we have all
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.040]   the appeal of a 1977 Plymouth.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.240]   I agree with you.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.920]   Apple will spend a few extra dollars to have a good-looking computer.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.840]   That means Apple can sell against Dell and HP.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.160]   The same machine with a premium price, getting the margins that those other guys will never
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:26.360]   get, and pretty much decimate the market.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.600]   I think this is probably the biggest possible, possibly the biggest thing Apple could have
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.800]   ever done in terms of potentially becoming a dominant computer.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.040]   But what about the Adobe's and the Microsoft's?
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.600]   How are they going to rewrite their software?
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.600]   What are they going to do?
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   I've done it before.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.400]   This is a recompilation thing anyway.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.720]   Adobe already has this software running on the X-80 system.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.160]   How difficult can it be?
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.600]   Oh, it could be very difficult because their Windows version relies on Windows API, which
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   is not the biggest.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   There's a middleware company that Apple's involved with right now, and this is going
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   to take care of that issue.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.800]   This is not going to be as big a deal as you make it out to be.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.200]   So the middleware company, I think you're thinking of, is transitive?
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:12.000]   In the change from 68,000 to power PC, these were very similar chips.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.800]   They were able to make it possible for the operating system to run both with something
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.640]   called fat binaries.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.440]   My argument is this.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.440]   This is the time for Apple to do it.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.920]   They can suffer through a transition like this, which I agree with that part.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.080]   It's not going to be easy.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:32.200]   But with the iPod iTunes thing making tons of money for them, this is the time to make
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.840]   this move because this long term is a fantastic idea.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.840]   I think it's gutsy.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.240]   I think we're going to look at tomorrow as the day Apple committed suicide.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.880]   And here's what I think the exact opposite, John.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.240]   First of all, they're on a platform that is far from Moribund.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:52.080]   I think that the cell chip, which is a power PC based chip, is a very exciting future chip.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.920]   I think the Intel platform, on the other hand, has run out of steam.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.520]   I think they're moving to a processor platform that is seeing the end of its line.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.000]   So you think I knew?
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.880]   With the new multi-threaded, multi-core Intel chips are nothing to be sneezed at.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:08.920]   I agree the new Pentium D and the Hyperthreading and then dual cores.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:14.160]   They're trying to keep this chip's family alive, but it's not a long term solution.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.960]   What about the notion of Intel maybe doing something new for Apple?
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.440]   You think that's credible?
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.440]   No.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.440]   It's going to be an Intel x86 chip.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.440]   I have to be.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.680]   I mean, if they did something like what you just described, which nobody said, I mean,
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.160]   that's purely just off.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.680]   Highly speculative, yeah.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   Yeah, totally.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.760]   I mean, there's no evidence of this.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.960]   I mean, I mean, you know, of course you never know.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.480]   But we would have known about something.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.200]   So you believe the CNET report?
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.680]   You think this will happen tomorrow?
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.680]   Yeah, I do.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.640]   And the Wall Street Journal is also kind of saying it's a done deal.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:51.480]   I mean, then there's a blog right out there which I link to in my blog if you go to devork.org/blog
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:56.440]   who made this observation that he found a language observation.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.760]   He looked at the articles and noticed that they weren't neither CNET nor the Wall Street
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   Journal.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   They see the words in their stories about...
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.000]   They seem adamant, yeah.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   You know, I just...
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.280]   It scares the heck out of me.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.480]   It doesn't seem like it's necessary.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.440]   I think Apple's in a good position right now.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.320]   It is a very gutsy move.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.360]   I mean, your scenario is attractive if they could start shipping computers that would
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.560]   run both Windows and OS 10.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.320]   I think there's a big market for that.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.000]   I think it's a huge market for it.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   And I think the other upside for Apple would be that they get one of the problems they're
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.800]   always going to have only selling one million computers a quarter compared to the $175
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.640]   million machines that are sold every year.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.560]   This is a ridiculously low number.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.920]   It's that you can't get the developer interest that you can to a market that has $100 million.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:46.600]   So you think that's the carrot they're going to offer these guys for rewriting all of their
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   software?
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.000]   You think Microsoft's going to play along?
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Office is pretty cool.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   I think Microsoft...
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Microsoft...
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.040]   No, I don't think it's as critical as you think it is anymore.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.720]   Besides that, if you bring out a dual boot machine, who cares?
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.240]   But the point is that I think Apple's been trying to get out from underneath Microsoft.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.600]   I mean, that's why they've been bringing out products that kind of compete with Microsoft
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   products.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:11.640]   And ever since Microsoft or Macintosh basic, the product that was killed by Microsoft,
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.960]   the people in the Mac community would love to just ditch Microsoft and go off and do their
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:16.960]   own thing.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.600]   And there's a lot of good stuff out there that runs on Unix machines.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:26.040]   I mean, some of it has crappy menuing systems, unfortunately, because the Unix guys, they
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.680]   think weird.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   But except for that, Piccadillo, I think most of this stuff, I think you can outfit a OSX
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:38.520]   machine with no Microsoft material on it at all and do very well for yourself.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.680]   Would you get in line to buy one of these machines?
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:45.560]   This is the kind of machine that if I was a computer buyer and I had to line up with
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.240]   different machines out there and Apple, which has already developed this name as a kind
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:54.080]   of like I mentioned in the column tomorrow, kind of the Lexus compared to the Ford's and
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:59.480]   Chevy's Dell and HP, I think I would buy a Lexus computer.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:04.680]   I mean, something that's a little nicer, definitely a better looking machine with a
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.080]   lot of cache.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.760]   I would get the Macintosh in a minute.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.040]   Well, there you have it, John.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.640]   Thank you for on such short notice for coming on the show.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   I won't know any time, Leo.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   You know me.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.200]   So there you have it, John C. Devorek.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.320]   He says it's a done deal.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   And it's a great idea.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.360]   You know, you heard me.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   I just don't buy it.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.640]   You think it's a good idea, Patrick?
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   I just think in terms of the sheer volume of the chips and the fact that they've got
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.400]   to be able to get the chips cheaper.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.040]   They've got to have access to better chips.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.200]   It just seems like Devorek had a really good point.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:38.960]   I mean, if they're tapping into an architecture that's going out to 125, 175 million PC a
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.960]   year, it's a lot easier to get deals.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.560]   So you're saying you're thinking they had to for economic reasons?
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.160]   I think they've probably had to for economic reasons and it's probably getting really
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.040]   difficult to compete.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.040]   Here's the third reason.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.200]   I think it's a very compelling reason.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.520]   It's the Osborne effect.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.880]   They're announcing now that in six months, the mini will be based on Intel and in 18
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.080]   months, all of their products will be based on Intel.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   They're not going to sell one more Mac for 18 months.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.880]   No, I don't know about that.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.160]   All right, Kevin, you've explained it to me.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.640]   This is so exciting.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.160]   I mean, I have two Macs.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:16.960]   I have three PCs and the only reason I don't just have one computer is because I want OS
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.920]   to be able to play my games.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.040]   I do like a dual boot.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:24.320]   I do like in the divorce, I brought that up a dual boot PC Mac is attractive.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.640]   But that's a total fantasy.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.640]   You don't think that will happen?
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.040]   It can happen if it's based on Intel chips.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.000]   And the other thing is you don't have to do a boot at all.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.400]   They can run a nice little emulator that runs inside the way it's in.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   That's a good point.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.280]   That will be native on the x86 based processors.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.880]   So you really won't see the slowdown that you would if you're running it in like a process
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   or emulation type mode.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.080]   You could do your exactly right.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.080]   You don't have to do a dual boat.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.080]   You could just have dual boat.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.440]   It's easilyatable or hackable.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:51.200]   But I don't see Steve ever signing off on doing a dual boot, you know, Macintosh system.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.080]   Well, the main thing that gets me excited is that I've always been a huge fan of Apple
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   hardware.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.200]   The computer, if you take part of G5, open it up, play with it.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.200]   It's beautiful.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   It's a beautiful design.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.400]   Everything is laid out so clean and so well.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:09.040]   The power supply, every piece of that computer is a so well engineered, it blew me away.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.320]   And I would love to have, I would pay a few extra hundred dollars for a nice Apple that
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.200]   could run my, you know, not only my Mac applications, but my Windows as well.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.880]   That's, I think we've done this to death.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.200]   Let's just go round the horn and cast the thumbs up or thumbs down.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   Good for Apple.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.200]   Bad for Apple.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.200]   Kevin Rose.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.200]   Thumbs up.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   Robert Herron.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.960]   I'd say thumbs down for the hardware side.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.960]   Roger Chang.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   I'd say thumbs up for software.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.120]   Thumbs down for the hardware.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   Oh, you will.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   Weasel.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   Patrick Norton.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.240]   If it makes for a cheaper Mac, great.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.120]   But I still don't believe it's going to happen.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.880]   I believe it's going to happen and I think it's going to be the end of the line for Apple.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.280]   I'm very disappointed.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:51.680]   A special midweek edition, episode 8A for June 8th, 2005.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:55.200]   We decided to release an extra edition of this week and take this week due to the big
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.400]   Apple Intel announcement.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:02.160]   Patrick Norton joined me at the thirsty Bear Brewery next door to the World Wide Developer
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.000]   Conference at Moscone Center.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, I mean for podcast people, these are, this is like rock stars.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:12.700]   Like I was with a clue from the folks at iPod or X Race, Lekenski, who does the back
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:17.800]   end Python stuff and August Treminor, who is the UI guy.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:22.520]   Tremendous work developing the podcast community on OS X with some brilliant software that's
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.240]   been available for everyone.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.040]   So now the professionals are going to take in and we're going to put inside of iTunes
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.160]   where it belongs and hopefully we can monetize it to the greater glory of the Apple community.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.320]   We knew the iTunes was coming but we didn't think it was coming as soon as it was.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:43.040]   We angled iPod or XW media aggregator, turned it out to be a very fortunate thing because
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.000]   now we can compete on with more features in iTunes.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   What did Steve say?
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.480]   Did he give us more information than he did on the Wall Street Journal?
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.960]   No, not really.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:59:00.440]   He gave a quick demo where he showed a screen where you can, within the music store, to
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.000]   select and choose podcasts.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.480]   You would buy them?
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.840]   There was no buy information, it was a click and then it was added.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.760]   He mentioned that it was for free.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:15.440]   Patrick, we haven't seen each other since we talked about the Intel announcement.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.320]   It was speculative the last time we talked.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.320]   It's happened.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:23.280]   But isn't there some sick little angry part of your heart that sees this great, you take
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.960]   the Apple style, you throw it on an Intel compatible processor, you get it out in the
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.960]   market, people can use the OS X, people will be able to, God help them run Windows XP on
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.440]   it, assuming unless the whole thing ever shows.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.840]   When we talked about this earlier, Phil Schiller was very clear that we will never sell OS X
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.000]   without an Apple box.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.080]   That's our business's hardware.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   But he did say that you'd be able to buy a dual boot platform.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:53.560]   Now Ray, who's, by the way, a hacker at heart, how long, I know you're not doing this anymore,
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:57.400]   but how long before somebody figures out how to separate the heart?
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.240]   Oh, you're six months to a year.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.400]   If that.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.480]   So then at some point you'll be able to download OS X Intel and put it on your PC.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.120]   You're all Coco.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.040]   You're 100% Coco.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:15.640]   So the pitch Steve gave is that, well, if you're Coco, it's 20 minutes work.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   True.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.200]   I think for the most part, pretty much is as easy as a checkbox.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   Really?
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   In Xcode.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.200]   In Xcode 2.1.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.440]   Obviously when you start a new project in Xcode, it probably says, does it say fat binary?
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.440]   What does it say?
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.440]   Power PC Intel?
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.240]   Do you have a choice when you do a new project?
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.800]   No, it's when you build as part of the target properties.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.840]   So when you're building, you choose if it's going to be a universal binary.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   That's what they're calling it now.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840]   That's fat.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.840]   That's fat.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.840]   I thought that was a good marketing term.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.640]   We're going to call it universal instead of fat.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   Yeah, better idea.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.720]   The Rosetta part actually does work quite well.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.720]   What's Rosetta?
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.720]   Tell me about that.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.720]   That's pretty much the emulator.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   That's the transitive software?
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720]   Okay.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.760]   And you know, your power PC binary on Intel through this.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.960]   It's the middleware that's best set.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960]   Yeah, it's the emulator.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:12.520]   We actually ran an iPod or X on an Intel machine through Rosetta, the translator.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.000]   And it's completely transparent.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.400]   You know, Rosetta is Apple's name for it, but end users will never know about it.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   And it worked just fine.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.640]   Everything ran.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.120]   What is the general reaction on the floor from developers?
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.560]   Dismay, excitement, worry.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.160]   I spent a lot of time in the Intel room kind of listening to reactions.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.360]   And for the most part, it's positive.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.360]   Really?
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.280]   Even the little guys who are going to have to spend some money on this, they're saying
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.520]   this is something they want to do.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.800]   I mean, this is a development machine and I'm not sure how much I can actually say about
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.760]   it, but it's fast.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.520]   They'll make you...
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.920]   Porting applications from Windows to Mac also a lot easier, I think, because just the
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.560]   processor and the low level stuff that you'd do working on would be the same.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.560]   Right.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.560]   VMware is still around me.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.840]   That was what VMware was.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.200]   Was it allowed you to have a virtual engine that you could run multiple operating systems
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.200]   in Windows?
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.840]   Now, that's exciting.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.120]   I would love to see a VMware or Intel that I have always 10.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.720]   You'd have to buy it from Apple.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.400]   Obviously, the hardware would have to be Apple hardware.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.640]   You wouldn't have the OS 10 part, but you could buy it if you could buy a Windows disk
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.640]   and stick that in there.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640]   Man, that would be cool.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.840]   Well, I'm wondering how long that's going to last.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.920]   You think Apple will stop that or Microsoft?
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.720]   No, I think that...
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.000]   I think Apple sells all of that.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.440]   Well, I think that home hobbyist hackers will have that running on a white box.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:37.080]   It can probably last in a year.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.800]   August, it's really been great to meet you.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.800]   Great to meet you, for sure.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800]   I love iPod or X.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   And someday, I know.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.400]   Twit will be number one on there.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.400]   Right?
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.400]   (Laughter)
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.400]   Hacker?
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   You hacker.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.080]   We love iPod or X.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.880]   And we really appreciate what you've done.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.920]   It is the best way to get our podcasts.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   We're in the directory, right?
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   Yes.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   And we're actually...
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   No, we've been an iPod or X pick for at least a month.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.920]   Right.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.400]   And you're in the top picks list.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400]   You guys have picked us.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400]   And that's you.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.400]   Yeah, that's not user.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:14.480]   We're not influenced by anything you might say here today at all.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.480]   (Laughter)
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   The fish cheeks.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   You know, I gave you fish cheeks.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   What more could you ask for?
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.480]   Come on.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.000]   Wait, disappeared off the list.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   It's a code 9.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.720]   Recorded Sunday, June 12th.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:31.600]   It seems like to the less you pay for a computer, the more extra crap you get installed on it.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.120]   Either through deals made, through the manufacturer or something of that effect.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.120]   We're in a crap.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   This is a crap society.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.960]   We're in a crap generation.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.960]   There's crap everywhere.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   There's ads everywhere.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   There's no...
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960]   You know, there's...
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.960]   I'm cranky old man.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960]   That's all crap.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   You okay there, Leo?
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   (Laughter)
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.960]   Hey, did you see that the OS 10.4.1, the Intel OS 10?
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960]   Is apparently on the where sites already?
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.960]   Yes, that's awesome.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.800]   I can't wait to get a copy.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800]   Less than a week.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.000]   I have to get a copy.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.320]   What is this about Apple being a hardware company?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.480]   When now all the focus is on their potential takeover.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   Not anymore.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   In the OS world.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.780]   Who predicted this last week?
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   You did.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:12.780]   You did.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.780]   This...
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.780]   Well, I didn't think it would be cracked so fast.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.480]   This forces them to sell it, right?
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.640]   It hasn't been cracked.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.760]   This has just been leaked off the developer system.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.000]   Can you run this 10.4.1 on a white box PC?
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Now?
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.240]   From what I hear, that's the rumor.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.600]   I was speaking with a friend of mine who's a Mac developer and he was at the conference
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.040]   and he said he actually got a chance to play around with the machine.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.400]   He was looking inside of it.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.240]   And it's just a standard Intel motherboard, standard onboard Intel graphics.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.720]   You know, off the shelf kind of stuff.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.960]   So I don't see any reason why not.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.160]   See, the minute it's cracked, if you think it forward, then Apple's going to have to
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.520]   do a shrink wrap release of it.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.480]   And then all of a sudden they are a software company.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   They screwed the pooch.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.000]   You're just not a happy man today, Leo.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   They screwed the company.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   I'm telling you.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.440]   I hate Windows, I hate Apple.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.440]   It's left.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.440]   Linux.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440]   Piece of crap.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.040]   All right, well, let's change the subject.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.960]   AMD details, early quad core plans, story of Friday.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.640]   They didn't analyst briefing specifically.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.200]   Multicore microprocessors and 64 bit processing.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:12.680]   The whole idea of like four processors on a chip is a little disturbing.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.680]   Well, isn't it?
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.400]   They're just going to leapfrog right over the penny.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.560]   I mean, obviously this is a, you know, marketing move.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   They're not going to do two.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.560]   They'll do four.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.720]   Is it aimed at workstations or is it aimed at servers?
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   Is this desktop?
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   This is more of the server end.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.160]   They're in the first quarter of 2005 AMD captured 28% of the total market per four-way
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   servers.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.960]   It's simply that it's cheaper to build more cores than it is to keep shrinking the process
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.480]   at this current time.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:41.200]   It just strikes me as kind of capitulation from the chip manufacturers.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.800]   They're saying, yeah, well, we just really can't get our chips much faster or much more
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   efficient.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.440]   So we'll just put more of them on a, on a die.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.840]   It's like, it's a clue.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.360]   They're good for servers because you're doing transactions, but they're not great for desktop.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.080]   You know, Intel guys were saying over and over the dual core penny amps, you're going
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.200]   to feel a difference as an end use.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   And I remember this guy I used to co-host a television program was a early dual processor
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200]   system fanatic.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   It's true.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200]   I still have that right here.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   It was Leo.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   It was me.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.440]   I still have my dual penny and threes.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.600]   And that's why I know how crappy it is.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.760]   But that's, I think dual processors, fine.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.120]   It makes a lot of sense for a certain class of application.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.760]   It works where there's a lot of things happening simultaneously.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.920]   I do think it's, it's an away saying, yeah, we just really couldn't make these processors
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.120]   any more efficient.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.520]   We have no other way to go.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.080]   I, I just seems to me that, right?
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.080]   I mean, it's more of a marketing thing than a marketing stuff.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:38.640]   Would you rather they accelerate it to a six gigahertz processor that was four percent faster
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.640]   than the four gigahertz processor?
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.640]   No, you're right.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640]   You're right.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.640]   We haven't seen much improvement.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.080]   I'm still using a penny and four, two point four gigahertz and it's fine.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.520]   Don't you feel as though that this is a good step though in the right direction?
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:52.360]   I mean, we have so many, this is something that Apple did a long time ago with the G4s.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.840]   Remember, they couldn't really get the speed of performance that they wanted.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.280]   When Apple did that because they were flat lined on their processors.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.280]   That's what's happened to Intel.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.760]   That's what's happening with Intel right now.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   Yes, exactly.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   More to the point.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.880]   I mean, you've got Prescott, which is really a flopped chip because the pipelines were too
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.880]   deep.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.840]   The branch prediction wasn't good enough and it generates a thousand watts.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.920]   The things like a little, uses a hairdryer.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.080]   If they had the choice, I mean, you'd want to have a faster processor as well.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.720]   Are we not going to have faster processors?
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.720]   Is that the end of the line?
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.440]   I think processors are definitely going to get faster.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.080]   Then the scientists are just coming up with the new single atom switching using Quantum
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.960]   Mechanic or the Quantum Spin.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.000]   So hopefully we'll have a, you know, that's another way they could reduce heat.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.600]   Well, on the PC side, they have their Crossfire motherboards that they're showing off already
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.400]   and the chips have to support two cards in the same system.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.360]   It's SLI's advantage that they have over Nvidia's SLI is that the cards don't have
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.360]   to be exactly matched.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.000]   And I'm not going to touch those for a long time.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.560]   Have you guys run in the same problems?
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.200]   I know we tried to do a couple of demos on the show of the SLI and it was just vloggy
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.120]   and certain games didn't work right.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.920]   At its launch, there were some issues.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.240]   Are you guys recommending any of these SLIs or no?
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.400]   I'd say we're past that very first bleeding edge generation of motherboards that supported
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   it.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.680]   So now there's, I'd say, a half a dozen good options out there.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.880]   But right now you can only buy Nvidia's solution.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.520]   That's mature enough to recommend ATI's.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.880]   It was just announced.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.840]   I don't believe you can actually buy anything right now regarding that.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.560]   I'm getting in two more displays this week.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.720]   I'm getting in Pioneer's new 50 inch plasma.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.440]   I find plasma is better for video.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.120]   Yeah, but if you plan on watching video, plasma is hard to beat.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:26.640]   I mean LCD is coming on, but where LCD matches plasma, the pricing level and the size level,
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.960]   it's almost twice as much money.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.640]   Like are you looking for 50 inches or?
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.400]   No, no, no, it could be smaller than that.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.480]   I just want a nice screen.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.480]   I want a 1080.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.480]   Like 42?
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.480]   Yeah, 42 is fine.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.800]   I just want 1080p is what I really want.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:41.720]   It's one nice advantage of LCD, at least for that sharp in normal viewing light, bright,
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.720]   brightly lit rooms.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.720]   That thing is awesome.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.360]   Actually, I think it looks a little bit better because sometimes with most LCD technology,
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.760]   you don't get the really, really dark blacks.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.040]   And if you're sitting in a dimly lit room, but as the brighter the ambient lighting becomes
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.720]   by contrast, something looks gray on the screen, it'll get darker and darker looking.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.880]   So your eyes tend to see things darker the brighter it is with the ambient lighting itself.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:07.880]   So for brightness, yes, for all the bells and whistles of a $7, $8,000 display, it is,
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   I'm pretty impressed.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.560]   I'm going to say I'm writing up a good review of it.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.800]   So Patrick sent me a link.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.920]   Is this a Tech TV on this date photo blog?
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.560]   What is the deal on this, Patrick?
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.800]   Somebody, it's a collection of stills from the site.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.320]   Wow, this is awesome.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.880]   And the Spycam too, I see it.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.760]   It's techtv-otd.textamerica.com.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.000]   It's techtvonvistate.textamerica.com.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.200]   And it's kind of cool.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.640]   It's like what's going on, what happened on this day in techtv history?
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.520]   What is this about DVD Decryptor?
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.520]   Did it go out of business?
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.520]   What happened?
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.520]   The website's down, right?
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.520]   They got a cease and desist.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.520]   You're kidding.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520]   Yeah, they did.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.080]   I think they gave it to the wrong guys though.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.160]   I never used Decryptor.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.840]   I was always a shrink guy.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.840]   Was that the problem?
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.200]   Was that DVD Decryptor was a company?
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.280]   They were, what was it, a lightning UK?
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:55.120]   Basically, they were giving the cease and desist and anyone hosting the file was told
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.560]   to take it down.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.640]   And the person who was the author of the application said that, you know what?
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.080]   They don't have the time or the resources to put up any kind of defense against this.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.760]   Yeah, the CD Freex posted a letter he wrote.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.120]   If, you know, 321 studios can't do it with millions, what am I going to, you know, what
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.120]   chance I have to fight this 50 pounds sterling?
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.120]   Totally.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.840]   Although the rumor is that Sony served him the notice because the slash time is the best
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.200]   quote, as it is rumored that he broke their new copyright protection within 72 hours of
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.200]   its release.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.200]   Wow.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.200]   That was my favorite thing about that app.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.720]   DVD had old, if you could just strip it, get it on your hard drive and you don't have
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.040]   to worry about region codes or do I need the disc or am I going to scratch the disc?
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.480]   Sure, it can be a pirate tool.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.720]   Everything can be a pirate tool.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.640]   I don't think Robert's pirating DVDs to sell them on the streets.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.200]   He wants to make backup copies.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.080]   Yeah, but Leo, you're saying, you know, we're the well-behaved people that are disciplined
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.360]   and only backup copies for our own use.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:54.120]   But look, there's no way to establish the relationship between file trading and piracy
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.680]   and lost sales, right?
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.800]   But if you think about it, there's an entire generation of teenagers that look at you like
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:04.240]   you're on crack if you talk about buying music, you know, because they download it all.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.440]   I mean, it's going to be interesting to see.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.680]   I'm tracking though, I just launched a new version of System, by the way.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.400]   Oh, yeah, let's give it a little plug.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400]   What are you doing on this one?
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.440]   Yeah, S-Y-S-T-M dot org.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.960]   It's, this one is how to create myth TV box.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.560]   So we start from scratch, show you about the different cards that you can purchase and
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:26.080]   then walk you all the way through how to set up your own open source PVR.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.360]   This is the system even John C. Devorak like.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.360]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   That was crazy.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.000]   So there's the plug, any other plugs anybody else wants to do?
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.680]   Hey, go to extremipod.com and send us your iPod picture and get a chance to win a whole

[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   Nicely done.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.800]   My beloved wife says that Leo, you can give away as many boxes of minecraft as you want.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.800]   [laughter]
