[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.520]   news with the best tech journalists in the business.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.760]   And I always enjoy what I sometimes
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.000]   think of as the old timer shows.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.040]   Good old friends of mine who have been covering this business
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.200]   as long as I have Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.160]   Always great to see you, Dwight.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.480]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   Still doing the blog at techblog.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.080]   I am.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.800]   Yeah, I am.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.200]   I'm mostly doing the social media for the Chronicle.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.480]   But I'm still right in my blog and I love every minute of it.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.080]   Good.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.480]   And I love the link role.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.360]   That's useful.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.600]   I follow that.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   Thank you, Dwight, for doing what you do.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.920]   Also with us from CBS Radio News.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.040]   It's important to say news these days.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   Apparently Larry Meggad is here.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.840]   He's also at Larry'sWorld.com.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.560]   Great to see you once again, Larry.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.280]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.000]   And Dwight, nice to see you.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.400]   Yeah, good to see you again.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.160]   Yeah, I heard you co-wrote a great book about Vista a long time.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.640]   We wrote a thing.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.800]   And here's a man who's never written a book about Vista.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   Congratulations.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.560]   Yeah, really good for you.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.840]   The only one on the panel, Mr. Tim Stevens from CNET and TheRoadShow.com.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.280]   Hey, Tim.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.520]   Good to see you.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.600]   Thank you for having me, Leo.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.520]   You were at the Tesla Model 3 event I hear.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.040]   I was there.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.200]   It was a late night, pretty exciting times.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.040]   I tried to watch it, but the stream kept stopping.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.400]   I got enough of it to really see the new car.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.640]   It's beautiful on the outside car.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.240]   And what's interesting to me is instead of the 17-inch panel
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.120]   in portrait mode, it looks like there's
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.840]   a regular, smaller screen in horizontal landscape mode.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.680]   Yeah, 15-inch in landscape mode.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.480]   That was the big surprise for me to one of the many surprises
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   that we had from the Model 3.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.640]   But that was probably the biggest.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.560]   Yeah, big shift from what we've seen in the Model S
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.000]   and in the Model X and a big shift for a lot of drivers.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.760]   There's no dashboard.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.680]   But I think we'll probably be talking a little bit more about that.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.560]   That was weird.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.000]   So they didn't show a lot of the interior.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.440]   But what I saw looked like an extremely, shall I say,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.840]   clean interior.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.800]   Right.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.520]   There's nothing behind the steering wheel,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.040]   except the dashboard itself, which is very low.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.200]   All the clusters, all the gauges, everything else,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.120]   are built into that 15-inch touchscreen,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.320]   which sits in between the seats.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.840]   I don't know if I could get used to that.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.800]   That's-- it's definitely probably the most controversial thing
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.480]   that we've heard thus far about the car.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.760]   But there are a lot of good reasons for it.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.440]   Probably the main one being cost savings.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.880]   You know, there are multiple displays
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.640]   on the Model S and Model X.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.000]   Now on the Model 3, there will only
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   be that one 15-inch display in the middle.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.200]   That'll give you everything that you need to know.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.760]   They did move it up and forward, so it is a lot closer to you
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.640]   than the display on the Model S or the Model X.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.680]   So it is within your field of view.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.080]   And you could also make the case that if the car is driving
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.520]   itself, which this car will be doing a fair bit of,
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.120]   speed limits are a little bit less of a concern.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.640]   But definitely, it is a big shift from what we've seen before.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.560]   And it's something that we've seen on quite a few other cars,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.680]   particularly lower cost models.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.320]   You know, again, it's a cost savings measure.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.400]   And as you're looking to launch this car internationally,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.600]   which must definitely wants to do,
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.560]   it'll make that process a lot easier to swap the wheel
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.400]   from left to the right side.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.200]   Oh, yeah, they do have to do that, don't they?
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.920]   I wonder if there's going to be a HUD, a heads-up display
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   of speed and something.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.360]   Because you don't want to have to look off the road
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.160]   to see that stuff.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.960]   Right, I wouldn't be surprised if they offer something
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.120]   like that as an option.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.480]   They weren't really talking options.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.240]   We asked many times, but they weren't really into talking
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.040]   about extra battery duration or extra performance.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.760]   Those things will be options, but they didn't really want
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.040]   to talk about what's going to be out there.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.480]   Just, yeah, they still get about 18 months before they go
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   into production.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.160]   So always to go, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.000]   if given all the rather critical feedback in that regard
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.920]   that they do add something like a heads-up display
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.040]   or something like that, it's a pretty common feature
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.800]   on cars these days.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.080]   There was one thing that I was confused in
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.400]   when I watched a webcast.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.600]   Well, autopilot be an extra cost item.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.920]   And he said the hardware is included,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   but will the service be free or will you have to pay for it?
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.200]   That remains to be seen.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.520]   I've definitely heard back and forth on that,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.080]   and I haven't gotten official confirmation.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.480]   I can weigh in on that one because having--
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.600]   I've ordered a Model X, I'm still undelivered.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.480]   And so they can--
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.840]   it's all ready, right?
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   So they have autopilot ready.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.440]   And then you have to pay money to implement it.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.920]   Would be a monthly, an annual fee or a one-party?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.800]   Well, it's not on the Model S or X.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.480]   It's just an extra cost that you add.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.280]   One time.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.000]   One time cost.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.600]   Now, there is some additional hardware for some of the things.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.080]   Ludicrous mode, they have to put in extra hardware and stuff.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.640]   But autopilot's just saw us.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.440]   Well, no, it isn't.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.920]   Is it, Tim?
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.040]   Because you have to have cameras, too, don't you?
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.440]   Yeah, the reality camera is built into the car.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.160]   And they're also the sonar sensors
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.520]   that are built into the bumpers, which also
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.840]   help for parking and that kind of thing, which
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.920]   need to be built in as well.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.600]   So it's actually probably cheaper for them
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.120]   to build them into every car and then
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.840]   all the switch to enable the software,
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.480]   then to selectively install that in different cars.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.400]   But yeah, it definitely seems that this
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.240]   is going to be a very affordable car.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.160]   It's about half the starting cost of a Model X,
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.840]   so they've got to cut corners where they can, again,
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.360]   the dashboards.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.400]   One of those things, and if they can upcharge you
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.040]   for software, that's not a big one.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.480]   But ultimately, when it comes to these systems,
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.400]   it's really not the hardware that is the expensive part.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.160]   It's the development.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.880]   It's the software.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.440]   It's the training.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.920]   It's all the stuff that goes into building those systems.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.880]   That's expensive, much, much more so than putting
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.560]   a couple of cameras and sensors in the car.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.320]   Well, I guess the question I have is--
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.560]   That $35,000 car that I ordered, what's
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.320]   it really going to cost?
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.480]   Well, you ordered one, Larry.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.880]   Well, I put down the deposit.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.400]   Elon tweeted that the average cost will be $42,000
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.160]   with options.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.680]   That's quite a bit more than $35, but--
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.400]   That is.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.920]   That's 20% more.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.520]   It's not.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.720]   So Tim, the inside of it looked to me in the photos
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.520]   that I saw in some of the video.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.000]   And I understand, by the way, that you could only
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.800]   use a smartphone to take pictures.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   You couldn't actually use a real camera.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.320]   No, it's a smart one.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.160]   And the inside of me looked Spartan,
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.920]   and frankly looked a little cheap.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.440]   And I guess maybe it's the absence of the dashboard.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.280]   But it reminded me, in terms of design aesthetic,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.680]   although it looked better than this,
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.920]   it reminded me of a Prius inside.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.520]   Does that fit with what you saw?
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.960]   It's actually very similar to the Model X,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.120]   the seats are very similar in which you see it in the Model
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.640]   X or the Model X.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.560]   But definitely, there's a lot of a difference.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.360]   The reduction of the dashboard, the removal of all the gauges,
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.680]   actually means that the dashboard is a lot lower.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.840]   And there are no traditional events in the car, either.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.120]   It's basically like a slit along the top of the dashboard
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.480]   that will be giving you all of the climate stuff.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.320]   So that actually has a really interesting effect,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.320]   because the dash is so low, you actually
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.360]   are moved a lot further forward in the Model X.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.240]   Three, then you are in the S or in the X.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.800]   So you almost feel like you're sitting over the front axle.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.040]   It's actually similar to the feeling in the McLaren 650
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.920]   or 570, where you feel like you're sitting right up
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.080]   in the nose of the car.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.880]   It has great view forward, which is really, really different
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.720]   than your average car.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.320]   And it actually makes the car feel very sporty.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.560]   I was only in the car for a few minutes,
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.400]   just like everybody else.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.680]   But that does give it a really interesting feel.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.240]   It is a very Spartan interior, particularly
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.960]   because there's no roof liner.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.520]   It's all class overhead, which is a very interesting thing.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.280]   - Almost all the way to the back, right?
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.120]   - Right.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.320]   All the way from the front wheel screen all the way back.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.800]   There is a small seam in the glass,
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.600]   so it's not one continuous piece of glass.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.680]   It looks to be at least two pieces.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.200]   But ultimately, other than a structural support
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.880]   that goes over the head of the drive in the passenger
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.480]   and another one a little bit further back,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.520]   it's basically all wide open, which again, makes it feel really--
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.040]   well, it has a bunch of effects.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.800]   One being that it makes the car feel very wide open and airy.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.240]   But the other thing is, because of that,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.440]   there's a lot more headroom than you would normally have.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.040]   And so they can move the rear seats back,
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.520]   and that gives you more leg room in the rear
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.680]   than you would out of a car of that size normally.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.600]   I didn't get a chance to get in the back seat,
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.080]   but it looked pretty comfortable back.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.640]   - So Elon made the point that it's going to meet
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.080]   the five-star safety rating.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.360]   But I'm curious when you're sitting forward,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.000]   if you have a front-end collision,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.640]   what impact is that going to have?
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.880]   - Actually, because there's no big motor up there
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.760]   that they had to worry about,
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.600]   there's no V6 or something slug in between--
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.080]   or head of the front seats,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.680]   that's a big piece of metal that they don't have to worry about.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.320]   That means they're going to have a better crash protection
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.280]   and then crumple zones up there
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.080]   without having to mitigate having a big lump of iron,
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.120]   basically, that they had to do something
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.000]   within a frontal collision.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.320]   So I definitely think that it's going to be a bit of a work
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.360]   for them, but ultimately, you know,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.440]   we've seen great results for the Model S and the Model X.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.000]   So I think we'll see good results there, too.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.720]   I'm a little bit more curious about how this thing
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.240]   is going to do in a rollover with that glass proof
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.880]   of that shadow of concern.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.720]   I mean, it does have the structural support over the top,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.720]   so I don't think it'll be clapped by--
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.280]   - Having a roll bar, I mean, but you might as--
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.640]   you're not more protected than you would be in a ragtop.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.960]   If I'm not convertible, right?
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.720]   - I think you would be, because ultimately,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.680]   it's basically like they just ripped the sheet metal off
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.200]   of a traditional car and you know,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.440]   there's typically a couple of struts going across,
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.160]   but otherwise it's just basically sheet metal
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.320]   and the headliner.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.200]   So it's basically replacing that with glass,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.520]   which does give you again more headroom.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.920]   But ultimately, if that shadows,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.720]   that's going to be a little bit uncomfortable.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.560]   - Yeah.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.720]   - Well, don't roll up.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.680]   - Don't have to have any hand-wise.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.440]   - I'm curious about the insurance costs as well,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.160]   because the windscreen effectively goes halfway back,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.000]   the roof and--
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.320]   - Imagine replacing that.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.000]   You know, you get a ding in your windscreen,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.640]   imagine replacing that.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.480]   - That's going to be expensive.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.720]   - That's a whole roof.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.160]   - Kim, have you had a chance to drive the Chevy Bolt?
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.000]   And if so--
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.840]   - Well, that's what I'm interested in.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.680]   - What is the pressure?
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.920]   - Because the Bolt is going to be very similar in price
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.760]   in range, which is of course the most important thing
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.800]   in electric vehicle, over 200 miles.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.960]   - And here's two.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.880]   - And it's being made by a company that has a track record,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.640]   a little bit more significant track record than--
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.280]   we know in other words that when Chevy says,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.480]   "We'll have that in the fall."
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.520]   That's likely that they will.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.960]   - Right, and I have had the chance to drive the Chevy Bolt.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.680]   Actually, I spent more time in a Bolt than in a Model 3
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.520]   at this point.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.200]   And they're very, very different cars.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.720]   People were comparing it to you because similar price points
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.040]   and similar ranges.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.640]   But the Bolt is very much a practical family car.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.680]   You know, the seats fold down,
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.600]   there's a lot of room in the back.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.440]   It's a big hatchback.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.600]   You can throw your dogs in the back.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.120]   There's no problem.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.560]   The Model 3 is not a hatchback.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.400]   It's a traditional sedan with a trunk that opens up,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.680]   not much like a tourist or something like that.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.840]   So it's not like the Model S or the Model X in that regard.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.720]   So the Bolt is going to be a much more practical car.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.480]   It's not anywhere near as quick or as sporty,
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.840]   but it actually is quite fun and driving.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.160]   Almost all EVs have really great throttle response
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.240]   to accelerate really quickly.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.080]   And the Bolt definitely has that as well.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   Hey, it handles quite well too because the battery pack
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   is down in the floor like in the Model S or in the Model 3.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.160]   So it doesn't have a lot of body rule there.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.040]   But ultimately, that's a much more practical car
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.640]   for a lot of people.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.720]   And again, the prices are going to be very, very similar
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.920]   for the two.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.680]   But I'm a little bit wondering about how people are
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.400]   going to feel about charging the Bolt because that is probably
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.360]   not going to have the level of supercharging--
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.720]   They might have the supercharger that Tesla's
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.080]   taking great pains to putting everywhere.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   Right.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.120]   Tesla and Musk made a big point about doubling
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.240]   the number of superchargers in the world.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.320]   And those are free, which is interesting.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:48.840]   Which is interesting.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.440]   If you're a Tesla owner, you pull up to a supercharger.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:58.400]   And how fast does that charge up, say, a 90 kilowatt Tesla?
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.000]   That'll give you about 80% charge in about between 25
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.400]   and 30 minutes pretty fast.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:03.920]   Pretty fast.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.560]   It won't go to 100%.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.000]   If you do want to go to 100%, it actually
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.840]   takes a lot longer to go that last 20% or so.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.800]   Just because of the way that they stack or the charging
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.440]   to protect the spells within there.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.800]   But ultimately, that's really quick.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.040]   And there is level three charging that's available.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   That'll do that for other cars as well.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.400]   But certainly, the network is anywhere near as mature
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.040]   as the Tesla supercharger stations are.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.480]   And it's certainly not free like this for Tesla.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.840]   And Tesla's even adding superintendents
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.080]   to some other charging stations.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.120]   So if you get there and it's full of people,
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.240]   you can kind of leave your car there,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   go off and get coffee.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.760]   And when the charger's free, they'll pull your car up for you.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.600]   Tesla showed--
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.960]   I don't know if it was a prototype or a concept of a station
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.480]   where you pull in and it removes your old battery
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.240]   and swaps it, a new full battery.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.040]   Is that real?
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.320]   Or was that just an idea?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   Are they going to make those?
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.760]   It was a concept that we've seen a few other companies try.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.080]   And there was a startup called Better Place
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.560]   that had billions of dollars in funding that completely
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.760]   imploded.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.080]   They designed the Model S with that in mind.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.760]   I think it's like 17 or 20 bolts to remove the battery pack
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.520]   and it drops right down.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.160]   You can pop a new one in there.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.680]   When they did the Model S, I think they thought
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.800]   that that was going to be one of the ways
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.200]   that they might go forward.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.840]   And I think they did deploy a few battery swap stations
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.640]   in California.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.760]   But if it hasn't taken off yet, it's
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.840]   just something that doesn't seem like people are willing
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.920]   to pay for a fresher battery pack.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.640]   I think they charge a lot, don't they, for a fresher?
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.000]   Yeah, because you're getting a whole new battery pack, right?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.640]   Well, you'd be quite a peritoneal battery,
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.600]   but I think it's an expensive swap.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.040]   It didn't have to be because of where to battery packs.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.440]   Right, it just hasn't taken off yet.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.400]   They've also shown a concept, a really terrifying concept
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.480]   of this like mechanical snake thing that,
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.080]   a probiscus that comes out and will automatically plug into
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.840]   your Model S.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.000]   They had that demonstration as well,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.760]   which I think terrified.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.960]   That's for autonomous.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   That's for autonomous.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.640]   That's so you could drive across the car,
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.880]   could drive by itself across the country.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.160]   It would have to go fuel.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.000]   I think what they want to do is basically have Model Ss
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.440]   and Model 3s and Model Xs be able to pull themselves
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.560]   into the supercharger station, plug themselves in,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.480]   and as soon as they're plugged in at fully charged,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.720]   unplug themselves and back out,
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.560]   unless somebody else is to pull in automatically.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.200]   I think that's what they want to do.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.120]   There you can see the video now.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.480]   It's really quite terrifying.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.000]   When you came up, my question about the model,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.200]   I mean, when I was justifying this to my wife,
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.560]   you know, why we need a new car,
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.480]   because we really don't need a new car,
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.320]   the only argument.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   Because you won't be getting one for years.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.200]   You may need a new car, but I mean, yes.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.640]   But the argument that I sold it on is safety.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.520]   You know, I drove the Model S and I've tested the autopilot
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.440]   and I was blown away.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.680]   I got on Highway 280, turned on the equivalent
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.920]   of the turn indicator and within a half a second,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.440]   I was in the next lane presumably with much lower risk
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.600]   than if I had looked around to make that lane change.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.160]   Will the bolt have that anytime soon?
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.840]   Or is that going to be more of a traditional,
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840]   just a warning signal?
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.800]   Like, like, is already on many cars?
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.600]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.000]   There's a big split between the Model 3 and the bolt
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.240]   when it comes to technology.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.120]   When it comes to active safety things,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.560]   autonomous piloting, lane assist and adaptive cruise,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.760]   the Model 3 is definitely way ahead in that regard.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.880]   You know, you can do hands off up to 80 miles an hour
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.120]   on the highway, change lanes like you mentioned,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.360]   automatic braking, things like that.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.760]   The model, excuse me, the bolt will have a lot
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.440]   of the emergency safety things like
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.120]   lanes, barcher warnings and things like that.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.240]   But it won't have the full on hands off,
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.840]   autonomous cruise that the Model 3 will have.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.800]   So it won't be that safe in that regard.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.640]   But when you look at the other side of technology,
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.800]   things like car plate, Android Auto,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.360]   the bolt will also have Bluetooth low energy.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.480]   You can actually create digital keys for the bolt
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.640]   and share them with your family.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.920]   So if your brother or sister wants to borrow the car,
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.240]   you can create a digital key for them
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.320]   that they can install on their phone
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.040]   and start the car, things like that.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.960]   The bolt is really progressive when it comes
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.480]   to the interior technology, the niceties.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.400]   But it's going to be a little bit behind the Model 3
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.600]   when it comes to adaptive safety.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.000]   But then again, the bolt will have been on the market
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.960]   for about a year by the time the Model 3 comes out.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.600]   And there's no reason to believe that Shelby wouldn't be
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.120]   adding that kind of technology as well.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.600]   Particularly if consumers are demanding it,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.720]   which by the end of next year, they probably will be.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.640]   - So Elon, of course, the best way to know
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.680]   what's going on about this is to watch Elon's
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.880]   Twitter feed incidentally, he tweeted half an hour ago
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.160]   that the Model 3 will be rear wheel drive only
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.520]   with an optional for all wheel drive.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.600]   'Cause to do that, they have to put in two motors,
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.400]   front and back. - Right.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.280]   - He also mentioned late Saturday that there have been
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.000]   276,000 pre-orders. - Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.200]   - That's 276,000 times a thousand dollars.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.480]   It's almost $30 billion.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.240]   - Yeah, and that's a nice free loan for Tesla
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.040]   and they can ultimately use all the money they can get
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.120]   right now to keep building out their manufacturing facility.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.200]   And of course, building that Gigafactory
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.160]   that they're building for batteries,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.640]   which Musk said is the single largest building
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.720]   in terms of square footage in the world,
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.800]   which is pretty impressive.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.840]   This is massive white edifice out in the middle of the desert
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.400]   that will be producing more lithium ion batteries
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.280]   than every other lithium ion battery factory
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.120]   in the world put together.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.000]   Once the thing gets into full swing, assuming it does,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.720]   and there are, of course, a lot of cynics out there
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.440]   that think that it never will.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.360]   But ultimately, they need a lot of investment
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.760]   to keep moving that thing forward.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.680]   And it's a drop in the bucket for them,
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.960]   but it is a really encouraging sign.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.280]   And even though this is a mature company
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.240]   and it is a public good trade company,
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.320]   they're still operating like a startup in a lot of ways.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.480]   And so, people look at Tesla,
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.480]   they look at the potential as much as they look
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.320]   at the profit margins and everything else.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.880]   And when you've got 270,000, some thousand people
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.760]   willing to pay you a thousand dollars
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.120]   for the privilege of being in line to buy something,
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.840]   that's a pretty strong vote of confidence from the consumers.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.960]   And that's the kind of thing that investors will
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.800]   end up with the spoon.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.640]   - I would--
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.920]   - Especially since most of us have actually put down
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.560]   our thousand dollars before we even thought
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.880]   an image of a lifelong scene.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.720]   - Side on feet.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.560]   - Yeah.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.480]   - I think Elon has played the greatest,
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.120]   most gutty, brinksmanship game I've ever seen.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.800]   And this is not the first time.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.400]   He's famous for taking all his money
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.720]   and putting it into the next thing,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   whether it's going to Mars with SpaceX or Tesla.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.080]   They've never made money.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   This has been just hemorrhaging money since day one.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.720]   And according to people in the know,
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.400]   like Jason Calicanos, who's an early investor
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.800]   and owner and a friend of Elon's,
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.520]   he said, "This is the end game.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.080]   "This is what Elon's been aiming at all along.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.160]   "Is an affordable, relatively affordable electric car
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.480]   "because he's not in it to make money.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.120]   "He's not in it to make cars.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.400]   "He's in it to save the world."
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.120]   So he wanted to get there as quickly as he can.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.480]   And what he did is he bootstrapped his way,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.520]   starting with the Roadster than the Model S
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.480]   than the Model X with very expensive,
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.880]   limited interest cars that paid for the next generation
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.280]   and the next generation.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.040]   I have to think on March 29th, the day before this announcement,
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.240]   Elon's got to be just on pins and needles
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.160]   because the reception of this car
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.680]   determines the future of Tesla.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.440]   Had they not received many reservations,
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.560]   I think Tesla's out of business in a year or two.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.440]   I honestly believe that.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.600]   Getting more than a quarter million reservations,
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   it's not merely about the $30 billion.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.040]   It's about being able to go to investors
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.640]   and say, "We're a real company,
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.720]   "a quarter of a million people bought
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.480]   "or put a deposit down on this car, site unseen,
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.400]   "help us build, first of all,
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.040]   "the new me plants capable of a lot more,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.440]   "the factory they own in Fremont,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.160]   "help us build out the new me plant,
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.840]   "help us build new factories."
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.640]   So what we don't really know is how long it's gonna take.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.840]   Elon basically implied late 2017, early 2018.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   And of course, if you're number 272,000,
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.000]   but they're only making what, Tim?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.520]   50,000 cars a year now.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.160]   Right, and obviously they want to do multiples of that.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.320]   I think Numi was in the mid 200,000 production per year
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.520]   back in the glory days of GM and Toyota.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.440]   So there's every expectation that Tesla could be doing
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.280]   a lot more.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.080]   And ultimately, the manufacturing of these cars
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.400]   is on a lot more simple than what GM and Toyota
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.040]   were building back in the day.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.800]   For the motor, there's one moving part famously
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.200]   versus V6, which has hundreds of moving parts.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.600]   That simplifies things greatly, but ultimately,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.280]   they're only using a fraction of all the factory space
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.120]   that they have there.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.000]   It's gonna take a lot of money to build all the presses
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.480]   and everything else that they need
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.320]   to really swing at a mass production of the model three.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.040]   But like you mentioned, they could not have started
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.920]   with the model three because the margins are just too slim.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.760]   They would have gone on a business a long time ago.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.800]   And it's only thanks to the dedication of Musk
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.920]   and the rest of the company and Musk continually dumping
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.280]   more money back in to keep the company afloat.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.960]   They've managed to stay alive this far,
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.320]   but you could tell at the event he was kind of stuttering
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.920]   and stammering, he was very excited to finally show
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.640]   this car to the world, but you could tell this was definitely
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.240]   something that they've been working up to
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.480]   for a very long time.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.160]   And that was pretty exciting for me to be there
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.160]   because it felt like being at an Apple keynote.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.760]   You know, at an old school.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.160]   - Yeah, but even Apple couldn't get people
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.520]   to get in line five years before the product was available.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.200]   Even Apple can't do that.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.480]   - And you know, he also was very good about thanking
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.240]   those who spent 100,000, 80,000, whatever.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   - Yeah, 'cause we funded.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   - I'm not a model, yeah, you did.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   You're sub-sus-ed out, you're sub-sus-ed.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.560]   - But I think everybody who bought a Tesla
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.360]   in the first few years knew that.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.760]   That it was very clear that, and I remember talking
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.960]   to people like Jason who has two Teslas
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.680]   and has an order for a third, that he knows he's spending
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.480]   to make it possible to get to this much more affordable
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.160]   Tesla, that's the goal.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.080]   - So Leo, if his goal ultimately is to save the world,
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.240]   and obviously he's got a company that he wants
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.480]   to make money with, do you think he's happy
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.720]   seeing something like the Chevy--
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.360]   - If all Elon cared about was money,
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.440]   he would have retired after selling PayPal.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.200]   - Right, so does the bolt make him happy?
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.760]   You know, Google supposedly got into Google
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.600]   and fired the question.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.440]   - That's a good question.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.760]   - In order to speed up internet speeds
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.600]   in the United States, and they've done that.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   I mean, essentially because of that,
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.440]   both Comcast, AT&T, or ramping up their speeds,
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.960]   is Elon Musk, you think, happy seeing something
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.800]   like the Bolt and the other electric cars
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.480]   that are coming in the pipeline?
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.200]   - Well, I can't read into his mind.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.080]   He's probably has mixed feelings about it.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.200]   - Remember, let's not forget that there was
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.120]   an electric car industry.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.080]   GM's, what was it, what was it called?
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.240]   The EV1?
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.960]   - EV1, but even back in the early days of motoring
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.360]   before they-- - Well, the first Ford was
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.960]   electric. - Right, you know,
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.960]   because gasoline was this kind of by-product
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.040]   that nobody knew what to do with,
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.680]   and nobody was really thinking of building an engine
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.200]   out of the things, there was steam powered cars
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.160]   and battery powered cars.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.280]   And the first Mercedes Benz, or the predecessor,
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.880]   two Mercedes Benz was also battery power.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.080]   So those were, you know, back in the very early days
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.360]   of motoring, there were a lot of EVs,
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.560]   but it just went by the way, so I think
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.400]   because gasoline was so cheap, nobody knew what to do
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.040]   with the stuff, so they made an engine that burned it
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.160]   and where everybody went.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.200]   - Yeah, and so it's been, we've tried this before
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.680]   and failed, in fact, there's a documentary
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.960]   that purports to say that the oil industry
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.840]   put the EV1 out of business, that it wasn't lack of demand,
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.560]   although I have to feeling that lack of demand
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.400]   was a big part of it.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.200]   And lack of charging was a big part.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.120]   So Elon's putting superchargers all around,
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.360]   he's very much addressing that problem.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.240]   You kind of started talking about that with the Bolt,
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.200]   you may have a 250 mile range, but basically,
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.720]   that range is limited by where you can get electricity.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.880]   - Right.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.680]   - There's definitely been a lot of people asking me
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.280]   because gas prices are so cheap,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.000]   do we even need EVs anymore?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.840]   - I won't be cheap forever, right?
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   - Right, there was a lot of--
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.760]   - Yeah, that's not forever.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.560]   - Cyndicism leading into the Model 3 launch,
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.800]   that this thing is gonna be a done because gas is so cheap,
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.280]   nobody cares about EVs anymore.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.120]   - I don't think so.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.720]   - I don't think so. - And all the other things
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.680]   we saw in the encouragement that we got out this event,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.960]   it's another big thing that people care about EVs
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.720]   because of more than just cheap gas.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.920]   People are excited about this car,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.560]   not just because it's gonna save them money.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.080]   - It's gonna cost me more, I'm anticipating,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.400]   even though I put big solar panels on my roof,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.800]   it's gonna cost me more to charge up
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.560]   that 90 kilowatt hour Model X battery
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.800]   than it would to just, I don't drive that much,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.840]   but it's gonna cost a lot of money.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.800]   Electricity in California is not cheap.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.000]   - Well, if you have solar on your roof,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.880]   aren't you gonna be buying? - That's why I put the solar in.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.880]   - Right. - You're gonna be having
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.960]   essentially no carbon footprint if you generate a carbon.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.800]   - But see, that's the point.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.680]   I may not be saving money,
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.360]   but I will be very happy to know that this driving around,
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.760]   I do, is not impacting the world,
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.800]   not even through an electrical power plant
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.280]   that I'm generating.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.120]   - So if I decide to bail out on my Tesla,
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:11.960]   yeah, give me my money back.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.160]   I'm still thinking about the 2016 Prius.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.200]   I drive a 2010 now, and my gasoline consumption is so low
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.320]   that it's really, it's essentially not an issue,
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.080]   either financially or that much of an issue
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.240]   in terms of the carbon footprint.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.280]   So, I mean, we do have alternatives to electric vehicles.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.160]   And what I love about hybrids, of course,
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.320]   and you can drive forever.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.400]   - Let me correct my math. - That's a pretty crime.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.000]   - Dale Poco's done the math for me,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.320]   so they've taken in $272 million in deposits.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.600]   The actual cost, the actual revenue,
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.400]   if they sold $42,000 Tesla's,
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.040]   that's the average, would be $11.4 billion,
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.960]   not $30 billion, I overestimated it.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.120]   Although I've seen articles predicting
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.600]   that that'll reach the 30 billion mark
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.320]   before all's said and done.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.680]   - Yeah, it wouldn't be spread.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.080]   I think quite a few people will be spending
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.240]   a lot more than $42,000 on the health rates.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.760]   - Well, boy, you look at the Model X,
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.640]   it starts at $70,000.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.960]   Good luck, getting out the door with that.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.040]   But incidentally, to answer your question a little bit,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.760]   and maybe Tim, you could weigh in on this,
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.720]   but how does Tesla feel about,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.560]   how does Musk feel about the Bolt?
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.880]   In 2014, he opened all his patents, didn't he?
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.320]   And said, you can use any of our patents.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.000]   I think that's not just lip service,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.440]   that's saying we want other companies to do this.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.280]   - Right, and he opened the presentation,
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.360]   the launch of the Model 3, he didn't talk about revenue,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.600]   he didn't talk about technology,
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.440]   he did a beautiful design,
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.280]   he talked about emissions in carbon dioxide
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.320]   and global warming, and so that's, you know,
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.840]   his end game is really to help the environment,
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.360]   to help the planet, and if you talk to most of the players
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.720]   who are just now getting into the EV game,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.240]   most of them say that, you know,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.000]   the introduction of any new big boat
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.160]   raises the tide for everybody,
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.800]   so everybody gets lifted up by the inclusion
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.720]   of more EVs on the market.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.040]   So I definitely think that Musk
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.000]   will see more competition as being a good thing,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.080]   because it'll get more people to think about,
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.000]   can an EV fit in my lifestyle?
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.800]   And once they get over that hurdle of thinking
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.760]   that I can deal with that gasoline car,
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.080]   at that point they start crash-hopping
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.080]   at what else was out there,
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.120]   and you know, the Model 3 and the Bolt,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.600]   I think are very different propositions,
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.880]   I think it's actually really difficult
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.920]   to compare those two cars,
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.880]   because like comparing a Civic to the BMW 3 Series,
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.480]   for example, but ultimately, you know,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.280]   those are cars that, if you get, again,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.760]   get over that hurdle of trusting the car
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.000]   and trusting the ability to charge it,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.800]   and that you're not gonna be stranded somewhere,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.640]   at that point you start to look at more interesting options
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   and the Model 3 is a very interesting option, for sure.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.560]   - In his blog post a couple of years ago,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.760]   when they announced this open patents,
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.120]   he said, "It's impossible for Tesla
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.520]   "to build electric cars fast enough
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.160]   "to address the carbon crisis."
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.120]   Our true competition is not the small trickle
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.200]   of non-Tesla electric cars being produced,
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.840]   but the enormous flood of gasoline cars
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.400]   pouring out of the world's factories every day.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.880]   We believe that Tesla,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.560]   other companies making electric cars,
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.480]   and the world will all benefit
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.560]   from a common rapidly evolving technology platform.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.600]   Incidentally, the deal is, if you use their patents,
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.920]   you have to let them use yours,
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.040]   but that is, I think that's a great collaborative effort
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.240]   to save the world.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.040]   I think that's great, I don't have anything to do with that.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.880]   - It's a bit of a shame though,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.400]   that they are building their platform
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.920]   on a proprietary charging standard,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.400]   rather than racing industry standard.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.240]   That I think--
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.800]   - But you can use an adapter, can't you?
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.720]   I mean, you don't have--
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.440]   - Well, you can use your Tesla in a standard charging system,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.000]   but you can't use a bolt at a supercharger, for example,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.080]   that would not be allowed.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.400]   And that is unfortunate that they don't at least
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.480]   allow people to pay some sort of a service
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.960]   and be able to use a supercharger station
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.440]   for some other EV.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.320]   If they really wanted to be progressive about it,
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.600]   I think that would be really the way to do it.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.960]   And ultimately, that could be a way for them
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.480]   to get a lot more superchargers and a lot more places.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   If they could become the mobile, the Sonoco,
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.440]   the shell of the EV game,
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.240]   I don't think that's what Tesla wants to do,
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.880]   but I think that would ultimately help
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.920]   to drive the industry farther forward
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.840]   than just sharing their patents,
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.800]   which ultimately GM would rather do their own research
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.560]   than license Tesla's technology, I think.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.400]   - Yeah.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.000]   - Well, so Larry, put down a thousand bucks.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.600]   Dwight, you're gonna put down a thousand bucks?
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.840]   - You know, I would love to,
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.920]   but I drive my cars until the wheels fall off
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.680]   and I bought one two years ago and--
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.440]   - Oh, you don't need one for a long time.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.440]   - But I am nagging my wife as best I can,
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.320]   and so maybe by the time they're actually available,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.040]   she'll have been worn down.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.520]   I would like to have one.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.360]   - Yeah.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.440]   - So I'm interested in the bold because I like the idea.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.160]   One of the things I like about the bold
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.920]   is that the network of dealers that support it is vast
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.280]   and in terms of reliability and service,
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.040]   I think it may have a leg up on Tesla.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.760]   The other thing is that you can't actually,
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.560]   in Texas anyways, one of those states
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.720]   where the dealers kind of have a lock on it
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.760]   and you can't actually buy a Tesla here.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.320]   You have to get a chip to you or buy it online
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.280]   and here being able to walk into any Chevy dealer
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.240]   and pick up a bold I think is very attractive.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.480]   - I'm pretty excited about it,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.880]   but I think and I look forward to someday,
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.440]   God only knows when, getting a Model X.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.840]   But I actually think that there's some,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.120]   I don't know and I have no communication from Tesla at all,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.000]   but my guess is that there's something going on
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.800]   with those Xs 'cause they don't seem to be coming out
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.120]   of the factory for a test.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.440]   - They're definitely having a lot of reliability issues
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.040]   for one thing and a lot of consistency issues,
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.720]   everything from paneling gaps to those doors,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.800]   must keeps joking about how they're given the problems
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.280]   not just in the engineering side of things,
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.600]   but also in the support side of things,
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.360]   they are having issues with them
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.400]   and not closing correctly and throwing faults
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.240]   and that kind of thing.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.160]   So they're having not only production issues,
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.800]   but also ongoing support issues with those cars.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   They are ramping up, they're building more now
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.640]   than they were before.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.640]   I forgot the number, we just saw what they're producing
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.560]   per week is getting up there.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.400]   - I have that.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.240]   My VIN is in the 800s, my vehicle identification numbers
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.040]   in the 800s, if they really were producing them in any cars,
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.960]   I think I would have gotten one by now.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.240]   - And they don't give you any estimates
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.360]   to when you expected?
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.200]   - No.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.360]   - Wow.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.800]   - And as you will learn, Larry,
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.000]   there's a privilege to be a Tesla owner
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.920]   or a prospective Tesla owner.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.160]   And what you're really doing,
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.840]   and I think is still true with the Model 3,
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.080]   is you're kind of saying,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.560]   "I want to support this venture
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.880]   'cause I think it's a good thing."
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.320]   Not so, it's like being a Kickstarter guy.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.040]   - Don't think you're buying a car,
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.360]   you're buying a lifestyle.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.840]   - Being on the list is just an important opinion.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.280]   - And to be honest, Dwight,
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.280]   I think you benefit by not being the first to,
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.560]   to with this, and just wait and see what happens.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.720]   People who waited for, you know, who didn't buy a Model S,
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   but now we're buying them,
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.040]   are gonna get the benefit of all those years.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.800]   The Model S is pretty consistent and is a great car,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.480]   and it's a good time to buy a Model S,
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.040]   and you didn't miss out that much
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.840]   by not putting in an order at the very beginning.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.080]   - And, you know, when you use the word privilege,
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.040]   I think Stuart Alsop would agree with you.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.280]   - Yes, of course Stuart got his yanked,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.800]   which is why I'm exceedingly cautious about saying anything
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.560]   about my close personal friend, Ian Lask.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.360]   (laughing)
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.400]   He, he bitched about the last event, right?
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.960]   The Model X event, and how long it took,
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.680]   and he never saw the car, and he said,
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.160]   "Okay, fine, you don't get one."
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.680]   - Yeah, Elon personally pulled his order.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.520]   - Yikes.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.320]   - And I love you, dude.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   - You know, Kim Crooked, you're done that to me.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.400]   - No. (laughing)
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.800]   - What'd I say about the iPhone?
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.000]   - Tim has never invited me to another Apple event,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.840]   but that's fine.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.240]   - But you have to take it away from your iPhone.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.360]   - You just have to understand when you're doing this,
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.200]   and I think Model 3 owners will learn this too,
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.120]   that you're not, it's not like buying a car.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.560]   It's a different experience entirely,
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.160]   including, I mean, look at it,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.400]   you bought it without even seeing a picture of it.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.720]   Little loan of test drive.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.960]   - By the way, it took credit cards.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.160]   I actually, I wasn't planning,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   I was driving by the Tesla dealer,
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.800]   and I noticed the line wasn't as long.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.880]   I touched scoble, it said he got up at two in the morning
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.200]   to wait in line, probably to Palo Alto dealership
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.840]   where I bought mine, and there was hardly any lines.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.160]   I said, "Oh, well not, didn't have a checkbook with me,
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.520]   but they took a credit card."
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.360]   - Yeah.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.200]   - Pretty easy.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.040]   - Yeah.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.880]   - Took about five minutes.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.720]   - Yeah.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.040]   - They take Apple Pay?
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.360]   (laughing)
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.440]   - Yeah, they do.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.280]   I think they'll take it,
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.880]   they'll take Bitcoin if you bring it.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.240]   (laughing)
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.480]   No, it's, I'm really thrilled to see this success,
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.080]   and I knew that this was a kind of a make or break moment.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.320]   I felt that it was strongly
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.840]   that it was a make or break moment for Tesla,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.000]   and clearly they made it,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.480]   and it's really amazing to me
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.960]   that a quarter of a million people were willing to order.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.240]   You didn't really buy it, 'cause you can back out of it.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.080]   - Right.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:42.920]   You actually didn't even order it.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.760]   - Yeah.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.840]   - Got you, I think you just paid--
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.680]   - To get a place in line.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.520]   - To be on the line.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.720]   'Cause like, I don't know whether I'm gonna get the $42,000
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.840]   version or the $50,000 version.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.680]   I don't even know yet.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.880]   - No, you don't get asked that until you get,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.280]   so here's what happened to me anyway.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.400]   You put down your five grand for the Model X,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.440]   and I did that in last fall,
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.000]   and then at some point in January,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.920]   you get an email saying, "Okay, now order it."
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.040]   And that's when you decide how to configure it,
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.480]   and that's when you determine what's gonna cost.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.600]   And then you have one week to configure,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.800]   and I went back and forth for a long time,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.400]   and once that week goes by,
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.080]   at midnight on that day, you now have ordered it,
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.320]   and getting your money backward,
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.920]   making a change is now a much more complicated process.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.880]   So you have plenty of time to back out,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.040]   long before you even--
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.240]   - And you can apply it to a Model S or a Model X,
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.080]   if you want.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.200]   They mean that's the clear.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.760]   - Right, which is great.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.120]   You may end up wanting to--
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.480]   - Only another $79,000 is an oven on that.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.920]   - I think only three or four percent of Model X owners
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.720]   have canceled their pre-orders at this point,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   which is kind of shocking to them.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.160]   - No, they ain't canceling mine.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.560]   - So the expectation, of course,
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.640]   is that carries over to the Model 3 pre-orders,
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.600]   and that's a lot of cars they've sold.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.040]   It's a very different market, very different car,
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.720]   very different buyer, but that's encouraging.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.800]   - It's kind of-- - But that is an interesting
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.280]   question too, when you think about the fact
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.480]   that there are people who can afford the Model S
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.960]   who are not well-heeled,
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   and it does strike me that it could be
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.360]   a very different buyer experience given the fact it's--
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.920]   - Oh, you're the Model 3, you mean the people
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.520]   who are now gonna get the Model 3?
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.080]   - Yeah, I mean, Model 3 isn't much more expensive
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.000]   than-- - Right, right.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.760]   - Stand far. - It's in that ballpark, sure.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.600]   - Yeah.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.720]   - Yeah, and there may be more backlash.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.600]   I bet not though.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.320]   I mean, anybody who's gonna buy order this
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.600]   without having seen it--
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.520]   - It's pretty much in the club, I would think.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.600]   - In the bleeding edge.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.720]   - Yeah, in the bleeding edge of tech.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.560]   - Drinking the cool thing.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.040]   - But, well, Tim, why don't you have an--
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.880]   You live in the frozen north,
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.840]   so an electric car is actually a bad choice
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.360]   for somebody in the upper-hand--
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.640]   - It's a bit of a bad choice for me,
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.480]   driving into the cities a bit of a challenge,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.960]   and there aren't a lot of charges up here
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.880]   around Albany where I live,
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.160]   but my wife, where she works,
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.800]   actually has EV charging stations,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.280]   so she's definitely looking to get either a plug-in hybrid,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.040]   or she had been planning on getting an Audi A3 e-tron,
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   but she went ahead and plugged $1,000 for the Model 3,
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.360]   so I think she's been away a little bit longer
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.320]   and see when that comes out.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.040]   But she's been talking about getting a plug-in hybrid
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.200]   being up here in the country a little bit more,
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.600]   charging stations are harder to come by,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.080]   so going into working back is one thing,
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.840]   but you don't necessarily want a car
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.680]   that you can only get to working back in, so.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.440]   I think right now, for us at plug-in hybrid,
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.080]   makes more sense, but a year from now, who knows?
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.360]   So she went ahead and headed to bed
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.960]   and put $1,000 down, and we'll see
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.360]   if something was looking a year from now.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.800]   - You might be able to answer a question
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   that my local Toyota dealer can answer.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.680]   Is there gonna be a 2016 Prius plug-in,
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.520]   'cause I haven't seen one.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.200]   - Yes, they're the--
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.960]   - They just announced those, they look great.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.800]   - Great, true.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.560]   - The New York Auto Show, which was just this past week,
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.600]   actually, so the Prius Prime, and it's interesting,
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.560]   the last generation Prius did have a plug-in,
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.120]   but Toyota never really marketed it,
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:49.960]   they never tried to sell it,
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.120]   and they sold very few of the things.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.360]   But with the New Prius, they actually gave it,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.440]   not a full redesign, but they put a new nose in the front,
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.680]   and a new tail on the back, and it looks a heck
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.440]   of a lot better than the current New Prius,
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.600]   which I don't think I've heard anybody say looks very nice.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.920]   The Prius Prime doesn't look great,
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.880]   but it is a big step forward, but they didn't give us
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.840]   a price on it, but it will be 22 miles on a charge
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.680]   before us, which is over to gasoline,
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.320]   and they're estimating 120 miles per gallon,
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.480]   which is pretty, pretty great.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.280]   So I think they'll sell a lot more with the Prius Prime
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.080]   than they did, 22 miles is a little bit of a disappointment.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.640]   If you look at things like the C-Max plug-in,
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.520]   or quite a few other plug-ins that go closer to 30 miles
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   on a charge, but again, 120 miles per gallon,
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.840]   you can't complain about that.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.520]   - And look at the Prius Prime dashboard,
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.040]   which seems very reminiscent of some other dashboards.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.720]   - Yes, that's good.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.880]   - An 11 inch portrait. - And they give it a hand
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.520]   'cause it's like an aircraft?
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.120]   - They did not give us any pricing, unfortunately,
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.080]   and unfortunately, that crazy dashboard is an option,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.720]   so you'll have to pay a little extra to get that,
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.800]   but it will have Android Auto and CarPlay built in
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.000]   unless it's with a great technology.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.320]   - That's the car I was right there.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.520]   That's a nice drive. - I drove the 2016,
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.000]   I like the ride, it's much smoother than my 2010.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   - It's a big room in the end.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.440]   - But I hate the fact it doesn't support Android Auto
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.360]   or Apple Play, I think.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.040]   - Oh, this is the Prius Prime, man.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.920]   - Yeah, Toya's bringing that out pretty much across
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.320]   their line, which is encouraging.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.120]   Android Auto and CarPlay are coming to a lot of cars,
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.760]   and Toya is definitely making a big push there,
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.280]   so it'll be on there.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.160]   But again, they haven't said how much you'll have to pay
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.920]   to get the extra batteries for the plug-in version.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.560]   I'm guessing somewhere in the $3,000 extra range,
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.320]   maybe a bit more, but we'll see.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.240]   - Yeah, you know what's interesting is I see chargers
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.600]   everywhere here in Houston,
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.000]   they're in office buildings, they're in grocery stores,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.600]   8V-- - Are they rarely occupied
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.080]   or are they often occupied?
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   But this is funny, in the apartment complex,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.040]   I moved in two years ago into a very high,
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.440]   and we sold our townhouse,
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.560]   I moved into a very nice high-end apartment complex,
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.200]   and it had two electric car chargers,
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.120]   and they were never used,
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.200]   and about a month ago they took them out.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   - Oh no. - They pulled that out.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.040]   - No, that I don't get.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.320]   Why pull it out?
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.360]   - Well, this is the parking, was at a premium,
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.160]   and people were parking there anyway,
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.960]   who didn't have electric cars, so they just--
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.200]   - We have three chargers in our parking garage next door,
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.000]   but the thing that put me over the top of the Model X
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.160]   was a supercharger in Petaluma.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.000]   - That's great.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.960]   - So, but my feeling is, yeah, you see chargers,
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.760]   but as soon as everybody gets electric cars,
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.880]   they're not gonna be enough of those,
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.000]   so it's gonna be fighting over, get into the charger.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.200]   - Right, and you got to Google,
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.960]   there's a lot of electric cars in the parking lot.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.600]   - Our new, I already talked to Lisa about our new facility,
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.120]   and whether we can put an electric charger or two there,
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.760]   you can make money on it as a business,
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.120]   'cause you charge a buck an hour,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.800]   and if it's always occupied, that's $24 a day you're making.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.000]   (laughing)
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.120]   - It's the e-tech journalist.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.440]   (laughing)
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.240]   - Beats being a book writer, that's for sure.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.720]   - That's right.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.200]   - Let's take a break, we'll come back with more.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.760]   Hey, we got a great panel, Dwight Silverman
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.040]   from the Houston Chronicle Larry Magad from CBS Radio News,
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:03.040]   and from CNET's brand new, Roadshow@theroadshow.com.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.480]   Tim Stevens, three of my favorite people.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.480]   I showed today, brought to you by my new blog, Host,
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.520]   new, it's not that new, I've been using them for a while,
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.960]   talking about them for even longer,
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.200]   and I have to say I love Squarespace,
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.480]   the best hosting, the best designs, the best technology,
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.880]   to make it easy to create a unique website
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.360]   that reflects you and your profession,
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.800]   your business or your personal tastes,
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.520]   great for a portfolio, the simple cover page means
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.960]   you can at least have a presence on the net
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.640]   that shows who you are, I love it for blogging,
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.600]   that's what I use it for,
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.160]   but they also have e-commerce built into every template,
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   that means you can sell, and boy is it, it's the bad,
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.480]   there is no other e-commerce solution that looks like,
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.920]   it's not like an afterthought, an add-on,
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.420]   it fits in beautifully.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.960]   And of course, if you want some help there,
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.080]   Squarespace designers, specialists who will help you,
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.560]   set it up, develop it, even create content for it,
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.880]   we don't mention that often enough, there really is,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.800]   but Squarespace has become a great platform for everybody.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.040]   Every design, of course, mobile responsive,
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.760]   that means you don't have a separate mobile site,
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.840]   all sites look great on all size screens,
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.480]   you get a free custom domain name
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.800]   when you sign up for a year,
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.480]   some new templates, if you haven't been there in a while,
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.160]   go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.760]   and try the new templates,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.360]   there's a grid style landing page,
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.280]   I'm gonna move my site over to that.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.400]   By the way, that's another nice thing,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.160]   I have all this content on my Squarespace site,
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.120]   I imported it every blog post I've done since 2001,
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.960]   and it's so simple just to change the look,
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.200]   this is my cover page right here,
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.080]   so simple to change the look,
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.240]   you just choose a new template,
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.840]   so I'm gonna try that grid style landing page,
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.040]   the infinite scroll, this is very popular now,
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.040]   and you see this in a lot of blog sites,
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.520]   in places like Vox, The Verge, so forth,
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.400]   you can have related posts appearing at the bottom,
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.520]   encouraging visitors to explore more
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.680]   and author profile page,
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.120]   which means each of your creators,
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.240]   and you can have multiple creators
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:07.600]   in a Squarespace site will have their own profile,
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.160]   integrate search field and header,
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.600]   this has really become a true content management system,
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.640]   and I can see a lot of people putting magazines
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.880]   and other online publications on squarespace.com,
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.160]   Squarespace site never goes down no matter how many people
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.280]   visit your site, an incredible 24/7 support,
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.480]   go to Squarespace, try it today,

[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.720]   use the offer code TWIT,
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.800]   TWIT,

[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.440]   squarespace.com, I pay it a year at a time,
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.440]   I just love it, it's been a revelation to me.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.000]   Let's talk encryption, the FBI,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.680]   decided to drop their case entirely,
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.600]   they said hey guess what, it worked, we got in the phone,
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.960]   so thanks anyway Apple, see you later,
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.640]   and now we hear Buzzfeed tells us
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.520]   that law enforcement around the country is getting messages
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.680]   from the FBI saying hey, you got any iPhones you want unlocked,
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.200]   we can help, we can do it, we got it, we have the means,
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.920]   which kind of indicates to me that Apple ain't gonna hear
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.120]   at any time soon what the security flaw is,
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.400]   that the FBI has found.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.440]   There is a whole process that federal law enforcement,
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.480]   a whole decision process, federal law enforcement
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.160]   can go through about whether or not to reveal exploits,
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.840]   and of course in general it's considered ethically right,
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.480]   if you discover a flaw, a security flaw,
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.280]   to report it to the company so they can fix it.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.520]   On the other hand, I completely understand the FBI's point
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.880]   of view, hey we found a way in,
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.040]   we don't have to go back to court,
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.240]   let's just keep this to ourselves,
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.080]   and meanwhile we'll call every attorney general
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.760]   in every state, everybody who's got a locked iPhone,
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.720]   and in Manhattan alone, Cyrus Vance Jr,
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.280]   the Manhattan prosecutor says he's got 70 phones himself
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.560]   that he'd like unlocked.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.440]   So I imagine that that's it,
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.280]   that Apple's not gonna learn about it.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.080]   Is that a bad thing, should the FBI keep it to itself?
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.720]   - Well I think this is, this has come up in for Apple,
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.960]   because they defied the IBM and dragged that out for so long,
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.160]   it's basically yeah, now that we know we'll show you,
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.840]   and this is karma.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.560]   - Well first of all, Apple, you realize that they can continue
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.680]   to improve their encryption,
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.960]   now not knowing exactly how the FBI broke in,
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.920]   might be a bit of a hindrance to fix that particular flaw,
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.360]   but Apple is gonna continue to improve their encryption,
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.840]   and it was hard for me to judge who won or lost
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.720]   this particular skirmish, on one hand,
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.040]   Apple was able to get off the hot seat, right,
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.720]   the FBI essentially dropped the case,
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.200]   and that's arguably good for Apple,
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.080]   but on the other hand, as you pointed out,
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.400]   it did expose a flaw in Apple's security,
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.040]   which is a problem for Apple.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.120]   So I think it's a little bit of a draw,
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.400]   as to what Apple comes out of this thing,
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.080]   but they were able to essentially take the upper hand,
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.920]   I think, I don't know if they won the PR battle,
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.800]   but they certainly got momentum on their side,
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.200]   by the time the FBI had made that announcement,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.920]   the polls were beginning to shift towards Apple,
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.960]   CBS News, New York Times had done a poll
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.920]   just right before that,
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.080]   and I think it was close to 50/50,
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.320]   whereas at the earlier polls,
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.200]   it was much more in favor of the FBI.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.440]   So I think the FBI, in a sense,
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.680]   miscalculated the public's reaction to this whole thing,
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.040]   and they got themselves a great out, once they announced
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.680]   that they found a way to do it without Apple's help.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:51.880]   - I mean, if the FBI, if we could guarantee
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.080]   that only the FBI would ever know how to do this,
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.320]   I wouldn't have a problem with it.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.920]   I mean, I don't have a problem with law enforcement
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.600]   having access to phones with the appropriate court orders
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.440]   and all that.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.280]   I mean, there are a lot of people who do,
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.600]   they don't trust the government,
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.640]   they don't trust the process,
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.880]   they don't trust secret courts,
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.080]   and I understand that,
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:15.120]   but given that we live in a nation of laws,
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.080]   I don't have a problem with that,
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.640]   but I do have an issue because,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.480]   as we've learned time and time again,
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.960]   these ex-plays rarely stay secret,
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.080]   and what if the next person to figure out this exploit
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.800]   figures out a way to put ransomware on your iPhone?
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.200]   - Well, you know, Leo, as you know,
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.040]   I run connectsafely.org,
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.160]   and I'm in the board of a national organization
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.120]   that protects children,
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.440]   and a lot of the people who I work with
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.400]   are very much on the side of law enforcement
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.520]   having a back door,
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.880]   but I actually took a position in a column
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.400]   that I wrote recently on,
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.880]   it's on connect safely as well as in the Mercury News,
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.600]   where I argue that children are much safer in a world
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.120]   where we have encryption,
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.600]   and that's kind of a counter-argument to a lot of the things
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.200]   that law enforcement is saying,
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.160]   that it's not just about security and privacy,
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.760]   it's also about safety.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.920]   The fact is that these phones expose who we are,
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.040]   where we are, who our contacts are,
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.160]   there's a lot of information,
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.680]   and there are health information,
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.720]   and even for children,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.280]   I think there's something to be said
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.240]   for living in a world where we have tight encryption,
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.560]   and it's very, very difficult
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.280]   to get access to this information.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.040]   Having said that, I understand your position
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.200]   is if we were absolutely certain
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.080]   that the only people who could ever get access to these phones
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.960]   or this data were law enforcement with proper warrants,
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.040]   proper subpoena, no abuses on the part of government,
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   no risk of it getting into the hands of criminals,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.000]   foreign agents, you name it,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.200]   then I'd be okay with it too,
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.160]   but those are some pretty big ifs.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:45.120]   - Yeah, well history has shown that in general,
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.000]   any exploit will eventually be discovered by bad guys,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.320]   and less apple has an opportunity to patch it.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.520]   What we don't know is what's the nature of this exploit.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.400]   - There's been some speculation that they were able
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.200]   to get access, I mean obviously they have the hardware,
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.680]   so getting access to it remotely isn't the question,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.960]   and there was some speculation that they were actually able
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.200]   to extract it from within the Silicon itself.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.040]   - Right.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.760]   - And in fact, before whoever the third party is,
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.520]   supposedly,
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.600]   - By the way, the third party could even be apple,
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.440]   we don't know.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.040]   (imitates whooshing)
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.360]   Maybe not here.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.240]   - We really could be, couldn't it?
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.320]   - But there had been some speculation about a process
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.680]   in which you essentially get into the Silicon itself
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.240]   and bypass the encryption,
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:37.280]   and there was a theory that that could be done
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.640]   even before this company came along,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.880]   and it's possible that that's what happened.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.160]   - Isn't that kind of what John McAfee was advocating?
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.160]   He had some kind of a scheme that sort of sounded like that.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.800]   - Encryption is always vulnerable when the key
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.000]   is kept on the device, as Hollywood learned,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.280]   with the DVD CSS encryption,
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.600]   in order for a DVD player to play back
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.160]   and encrypt a DVD, it had to have the key.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.880]   So when they created the Blu-ray player,
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.280]   they created the option to revoke keys,
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.280]   and as far as I know that has never been used,
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.120]   because unfortunately when you revoke a key,
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.880]   suddenly you break all the Blu-ray players in existence,
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.640]   and unless they can all be updated,
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.920]   you're gonna have some very angry customers.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.040]   So even though that exists, Hollywood's never used it,
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.840]   I presume that there is a similar vulnerability
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.440]   of some kind with the iPhone
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.520]   that the key must be some way stored.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.760]   I mean, the key is your password.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.240]   - Right, which is not all of that secure,
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.760]   if it weren't for this automatic 10-time--
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.840]   - Four digits is even six digits, not very secure, right?
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.760]   - Not for a computer, is it?
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.560]   - No, although you can, and bad guys certainly will
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.120]   turn on a long, full, strong password on the iPhone.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.760]   So the real question is,
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.480]   is this exploit bypass the four digit,
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.920]   bypass the six digit, bypass the auto or race?
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.400]   What does it do?
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.000]   If it just bypasses the four digit,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.720]   I think that's relatively harmless.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.480]   If it somehow allows somebody access
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.360]   to the strong encryption on the phone
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.360]   and access to the data that's been encrypted,
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.040]   it really makes the phone very vulnerable.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.640]   I just, we don't know.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   That's the problem, we just don't know.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.240]   And an exploit can't be limited
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.760]   to the things it can do, right?
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.840]   So that's the problem.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:33.280]   I have mixed feelings about this.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.720]   It's not the end of it.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.520]   We're going, there still is this issue of going dark.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.360]   This was just one phone, one version of the OS.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.320]   Apple, of course, is committed to strengthening their OS.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.240]   They've established that fact,
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.080]   and presumably will continue to strengthen it
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.480]   to the point where they, you know,
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.440]   makes it hard for a law enforcement to get in.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.360]   And I think eventually it's going to go to Congress
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   and the Congress is going to have to make some decisions.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.240]   - It's worth pointing out, Leo,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.440]   that law enforcement in some ways has more tools
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.080]   to access our information now than they did before.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.480]   They were iPhones and Android phones and Blackberries.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.040]   I mean, they've got metadata that they can get through.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.240]   - A horse. - A horse.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.800]   - They've got cloud backup services,
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.240]   which they would have gotten in the case of this phone
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.360]   if they hadn't bungled it by changing the password.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.400]   They would have gone iCloud.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.440]   There's all sorts of, you know,
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.080]   there's ISPs that are in the middle,
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.600]   there are internet services like Facebook and Google
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.520]   and Gmail in the middle.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.880]   So it's not as if law enforcement is entirely in the dark,
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.360]   even with encryption.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.080]   And that's often forgotten in this discussion.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.480]   They try to make it sound like,
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.320]   oh my gosh, every tool we've ever had
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.360]   at our disposal has been taken away from us.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.680]   We're living in a horrible world
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.320]   where the criminals are running amok.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.160]   That's really not exactly the truth,
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.200]   given the way, given the amount of data
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.760]   that still is accessible.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.840]   - Well, here's an example.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.320]   This is a case in Arkansas.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.640]   The FBI has agreed to help in this case.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.520]   There's a locked iPhone and iPod
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.400]   that belongs to two teenagers
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.200]   who are accused of killing a couple
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.360]   that had raised them as their grandson.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:09.880]   And apparently prosecutors that believe
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.720]   that there's something in the phone or the iPod
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.000]   that would help them in determining
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.600]   their guilt or innocence.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.080]   And the FBI has stepped forward and said,
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.880]   okay, well, we'll tell you what's on that phone
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.320]   or that iPod.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.640]   So the defense attorney was ordered last week
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.880]   to hand over the iPod.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.080]   It was in the defense's evidence locker.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.440]   What they, I think are going for
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.760]   is recorded phone conversations.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.520]   Well, no, I'm sorry, there were recorded phone conversations
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.880]   which had indicated that he had communicated
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.080]   his homicide plans on the iPod.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.680]   So they're looking for text messages
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.640]   or email messages on the iPod.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.520]   In a case like that,
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:59.360]   - Couldn't they get those messages from the email provider
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.080]   or the text or the cellular company?
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.760]   - Well, unless he was using, who knows?
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.320]   I mean, I use PGP all the time.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.120]   And of course, I only, I don't have,
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.440]   I'm not communicating anything that needs to be private,
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.000]   but I use it just because I can.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.600]   And so there are a number of people I correspond with.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.360]   I've got their key, they've got my key
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.200]   and it's routinely signed by my email client.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.000]   And the problem, that's the real problem
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.960]   is that if you're a bad guy, the means exist.
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.560]   Not for these teenagers who are just nitwits.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.280]   And that's-- - The terrorists, yeah.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.440]   The serious criminals.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:35.880]   - Serious criminals, but lots of run of the mill criminals
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.600]   aren't very sophisticated for whom
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.200]   these kinds of techniques will be very useful.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.240]   I have such mixed feelings, I just don't know.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.640]   What we don't want, and I think we all agree,
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.600]   is for the government to do anything
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.840]   that makes us less safe.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.680]   - Right.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.960]   - We want, all of this is to make us more safe.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.160]   And if it does something like, you know,
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.840]   crack this encryption and it leaks out,
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.760]   that makes us less safe
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.920]   than they haven't done their job properly.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.320]   That's really the issue.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:07.160]   - I think that's part of the big shame
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.560]   of how they saw us shook out,
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.600]   was that it never really went all the way through,
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   it didn't go all the way through
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.280]   to, you know, all the way to the Supreme Court.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.920]   It didn't really result in something formal
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.960]   that we could all at least feel was conclusive.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.800]   - Exactly.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.200]   - It feels like if anything, we've just raised more questions
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.680]   on this whole deal than we had at the beginning,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.240]   which is, you know, the government got what they wanted,
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.200]   ultimately, or the FBI at least got what they wanted,
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.760]   out of the deal Apple did not get what they wanted,
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.400]   which was sort of guaranteed for privacy.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.640]   And certainly a lot of consumers did not get what they wanted,
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.200]   which was an answer of what is the legality of this procedure.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.040]   And that, you know, means that ultimately the ball
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.360]   just got kicked further down the field.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.880]   And I'm sure we're gonna come to this sort of situation again
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.920]   and then not to distant future
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.040]   and we'll go through it all over again.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:46.880]   Hopefully at some point,
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.040]   we will get something concrete and conclusive
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.080]   and in the open that we can all know about it,
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.040]   at least know what our rights are in this regard.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:59.560]   - Speaking of Apple, April 1st, 1976,
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:03.160]   Apple incorporates there are 40 years old,
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:06.320]   Walt Mossberg did a video where he had all his old stuff,
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.680]   pulled out all his old stuff.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.680]   - That's kind of a little gazillion of that.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.080]   - What is that, a 2CX, 2Ci?
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.000]   It's a portable, the Apple 2 portable.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.080]   - A luggable.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:18.920]   - Luggable, really.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.360]   Well, though, smaller than a compact.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.120]   - Right, yeah, no modern.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.800]   That's true, there's no moderners,
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.200]   so you have to lug that too.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.280]   Oh, yeah, right.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.960]   - Any memories of 1976, you old timers?
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.760]   - Well, I was a mainframe jockey in 1970.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.600]   - Really?
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.000]   - I did get an Apple 2 in 1979, I think.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.840]   - Wow.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.960]   - And it was absolutely mind-boggling
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.760]   to have this machine that I could afford to buy,
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.680]   that I could actually carry around if I needed,
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.520]   I wasn't portable, but I moved from Massachusetts to California
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.680]   and I put it in the back of my car and didn't,
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.560]   you know, I didn't need a moving van.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.080]   And it was life-changing.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.120]   I mean, it literally changed.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.200]   In fact, it changed my career.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.920]   I was getting a doctorate in education,
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.480]   which I actually wound up getting,
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.720]   and I haven't had a job in education ever
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.760]   because I was so excited about the Apple 2
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.880]   that I wanted to be becoming a technology writer
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.760]   instead of a college professor.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.520]   But, you know, it was just amazing.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.840]   And to see how Apple was able to reinvent itself
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.120]   so many times and bring itself literally
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.320]   from the verge of extinction before it's deep jobs came back,
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.400]   I think it was in 1997, if I don't recall,
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.200]   and turn itself into a consumer electronics company,
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.080]   is really a remarkable story that we'll be remembered,
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   I think as long as we remember businesses,
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.640]   this will be remembered as an amazing company.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:43.560]   - Kind of fun, Regis McKenna, who was the genius PR guy
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.040]   who helped Apple get on the map,
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.760]   and not just Apple, Intel, and many others,
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.240]   get on the map, has released some of his notebooks
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.680]   from those early days.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.440]   First revelation is that Regis McKenna apparently
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.280]   owned a rubber stamp that said,
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.840]   "Return to Regis McKenna himself."
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.960]   (laughing)
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.360]   He's a bizarre rubber stamp to make, but okay.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:09.200]   And in these notebooks, fascinating stuff.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.400]   I mean, I guess this was his MO, this is how he operated.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.720]   And so he would take notes, copious notes,
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.160]   here's a note from a meeting in 1972 with Intel.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.360]   What is a microcomputer?
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.200]   How do you use it?
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.720]   Typical applications.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.760]   He's helping them figure out how to create ads like this.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.360]   How to use, this is 1973.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.880]   What is a microcomputer?
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.720]   What does it do?
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.560]   How to use it?
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.800]   McKenna was an absolute genius,
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.400]   and hiring him was a brilliant, brilliant move.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.680]   He met with jobs when he was 21, in 1976.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.920]   Woz was 25, took copious notes.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.920]   Here's a letter from Regis dated June 22nd,
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.760]   I'm sorry, June 22nd, 1976,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.720]   just a couple of months after incorporation.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.840]   I met with Steve Jobs at Apple last Thursday in his garage.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.600]   And then Steve visited our office, he is 21.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.040]   Along with the 25 year old partner,
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.400]   Steve has designed, manufactured,
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.200]   and is marketing a microprocessor system.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.040]   The Apple One computer, his first ad is attached.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.520]   It will appear in interface.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.360]   Remember that?
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.640]   Interface magazine?
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.480]   Absolutely.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   In July, this is just great stuff.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.240]   Really, this fast company had the article.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.280]   And Harry McCracken, I think wrote that.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.080]   Of course, Harry probably kept all of this stuff.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.880]   Harry has become our archivist.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.880]   He's a walking museum.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.600]   He is, in terms of his dollar.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.480]   Thank you, Harry.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.520]   Yeah, this is a great article.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.520]   And thank you for reminding me
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.800]   that this is a good give credit to Harry.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.040]   By the way, that first Apple, I think my Apple Two,
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.400]   when I finally got it decked out,
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.000]   I bought it with a cassette player at first,
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.480]   because I wanted to save money.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.320]   And then the next day,
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.160]   I went and bought myself a floppy disk drive,
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.880]   because it was obviously needed it.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.240]   And then I had to buy a 80 column card,
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.720]   because I wanted to use it for serious word processing.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.760]   And I had to buy a card that allowed me to go
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.000]   uppercase and lowercase,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.600]   because the original Apple Two was only uppercase letters.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.640]   But by the time I fully decked out the machine,
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.520]   to the point where it was actually usable,
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.520]   I'm gonna wanna say almost three grand.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.400]   I think it was about three grand for the whole thing.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.040]   Which for a long time was the typical price
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.360]   of a computer you could actually use.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.800]   2500 was the number, right?
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.880]   The computer you want is 2500.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.400]   We used to say that.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.560]   Now it's 200.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.920]   Yeah, really.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.760]   Or 5,000.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.760]   And remember this is $5,000.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.880]   This was $3,981.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.320]   Yeah, I have to do the math.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.720]   It was money when it was real money.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.120]   Yeah. Exactly.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.200]   Here's the first Apple ad
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.480]   that also appeared in the Interface magazine,
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.320]   with a typo in the very first line,
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.600]   the Apple One system.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:54.720]   If a fully assembled tested and burned in microprocessor,
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:59.520]   I think he meant is a fully a typo.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.640]   And of course the famous price of the Apple One,
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.640]   $666.66, which was, that was a hysterical joke.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:12.160]   And it includes, get this four kilobytes of RAM.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.560]   Wow.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.400]   Wow.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.480]   Nice stuff.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.080]   And there's Ron Wayne's very famous,
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.720]   beautiful illustration of Sir Isaac Newton.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.240]   It was too complicated to end up using as the Apple logo.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.520]   It was the first Apple company logo.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.040]   Ron Wayne only lasted two weeks before he said,
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.440]   "You guys are scaring me.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.360]   I gotta get out of here.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.920]   You could get sued and I'd be left with it."
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.320]   As the only guy who has anything,
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.320]   I'd be left with nothing.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.960]   I interviewed Ron Wayne on triangulation a few months ago,
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.560]   and a great guy who never regretted
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.400]   failing at Apple,
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.920]   even though he'd be a multi-billionaire at this point.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.200]   Really?
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.560]   I'm so, how did Harry go to Regis McKenna
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.400]   and say, "Can we copy your notebooks?
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.320]   How did he get these?
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.720]   They're just great."
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.560]   And well worth reading,
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.400]   you can click on them to blow them up.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.600]   Really a fun story.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.440]   - Who's that picture?
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.280]   That's great picture.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.720]   - There's Regis and Steve in the early 1980s.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.760]   Really, really great stuff.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.880]   - Really a contrast in styles too in that picture.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.800]   - Well, yeah, Steve was a barefoot hippie.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.640]   - That's right.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.480]   - And Regis.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   - But it's Melly barefoot hippie,
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.080]   and Regis was a button-down guy.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.280]   But I think Steve was aspired to be what Regis was, I think.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.720]   And one thing Steve Jobs was as a sponge.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.320]   He learned from everybody he was around.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.200]   I think he learned a lot from Regis.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.880]   'Cause Steve became probably the best marketer
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.920]   of our time.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.520]   - Well, it was also amazing about Apple.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.800]   And I have to say, to some extent,
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.520]   they've continued this tradition up through the iPhone
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.040]   and the iPad, is creating technology
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.280]   that's actually easy to use.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.920]   I mean, the Apple II, compared to what preceded it,
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.040]   was so much easier to use than anything.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.440]   Well, you could argue the Radio Shack,
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.920]   Battle One was comparable,
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.200]   but it really was a breakthrough time.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.120]   And then of course, the Macintosh,
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.200]   which came out in '84, was another breakthrough product.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.360]   And the same could be said, I think, for the iPhone,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.240]   when compared to a Blackberry.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.560]   So they've had a good track record,
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.240]   whether they'll continue that at this point,
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.120]   or if anybody's guess.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.080]   - Yeah, this feels like, maybe not,
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.320]   but it feels like they've reached kind of the end
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.680]   of the innovation line,
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.000]   and they're now more evolutionary.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.800]   - It feels that to me, I mean, given the fact that,
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.720]   okay, great, we now have a new four-inch iPhone.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.440]   That's the great innovation of 2016 so far.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.320]   - And a shrunk-down iPad Pro.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.320]   Although I bought the iPad Pro,
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.720]   and the iPad Pro itself was too big for me,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.600]   but the 9.7-inch iPad Pro,
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.880]   even with its little keyboard,
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.120]   is exactly what I wanted.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.200]   I could carry it around with me in my backpack
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.920]   and have it at all times.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.720]   And it's actually kind of an interesting,
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.720]   but it's purely evolutionary, if even that.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.760]   - Yeah, I don't think that Apple,
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.120]   while Apple's stuff is probably simpler,
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.720]   try to find a setting in Windows 10 versus OS 10.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.360]   It's usually a little easier.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.280]   But I think when you look at some of the things
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.360]   that they have done in the last three or four years with iOS,
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.000]   it is so much more complicated,
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.840]   and things seem so much more random.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.600]   You know, hand an iPhone to somebody and tell them,
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.200]   how do you do this if they're not familiar with it?
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.800]   And with the early iPhones,
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.400]   you know, you could figure it out pretty quickly,
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.480]   but you have a lot of puzzlement, I think, now.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.880]   They, it's much more complex,
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.760]   and they haven't figured out, I think,
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.480]   how to mass that complexity with a simpler interface.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:42.000]   - They made, I think, a little minute mistake in iOS.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   When the Apple, or the Macintosh first came out,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.920]   and by the way, if you're at Apple,
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.680]   historian or Apple fan tomorrow on "Tranulation"
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.320]   Bill Atkinson will be in studio with--
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.240]   - Great, oh wow.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.080]   - The guy who wrote the ROMs
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.120]   for the original Macintosh invented Quickdraw,
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.360]   which was a brilliant, brilliant bit of code,
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.840]   and MacPane and MacDraw.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.960]   But in those days, one of the things Apple did write
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.120]   was they had a very detailed, specific manual
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.360]   for programmers on the Apple user interface,
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.960]   and this is how it must be done.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.480]   This is the right way to do it.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.000]   One of the things they had,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.760]   one of the tenants that I really took to heart
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.720]   at the time reading, having read their interface guidelines
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.200]   was something they called monotony.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.400]   There should be one and only one way to do anything,
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.720]   because the human brain learns that pathway.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.160]   You don't want multiple pathways, it's too confusing.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.560]   That's why the one button mouse for so long.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.720]   There were a lot of things that Apple did write.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.920]   When iOS came out, they didn't do the same user interface
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.160]   guidelines, and as a result,
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.760]   and I think this is really where the confusion lies,
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.920]   if you're using Apple stuff, you can kind of figure it out,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.040]   but every app has a different UI,
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.960]   and there's no standard for how you do things,
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.760]   and try to figure it out.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.200]   The settings sometimes are in the app,
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.920]   sometimes they're in the settings for the phone itself.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.000]   - Yeah, it's all over the place.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.760]   - I mean, you say that, because I actually find Android
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.240]   in some way easier to use, which is ironic, right?
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.080]   Because--
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:08.920]   - Google has much more strict--
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.760]   - Google has much more strict.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.480]   - Yes, much more strict UI guidelines.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.240]   - I'm an Android fan, frankly.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.240]   - I think Google's been more willing to rethink
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.880]   the operating system as well than Apple.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.200]   Apple seems very, very tied to this idea
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.320]   that iOS is very simple, and so as it adds more
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.920]   and more comprehensive functionality,
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.280]   it just feels more and more tacked on.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.280]   The notification system in iOS still bugs the hell out
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.800]   of many versus an Android, which is much more intuitive
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.680]   and much more easy to clear notifications out
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.120]   and the high notifications that I don't want
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.920]   or disable them altogether.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.200]   Things like that in iOS, it just still feels like
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.160]   there's a glued on top of the original iOS,
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.080]   which was never meant to have notifications in the first place.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.640]   I really think that it's time for iOS to be
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.240]   not quite a clean slate, but it's not going to be--
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.240]   - Free thought, yeah.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.080]   - Yeah, because ultimately it's doing a lot more
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.080]   than it was ever intended to do,
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.440]   and to keep adding on more functionality
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.600]   just feels more like a square peg getting driven harder
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.800]   and harder into a round hole.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.160]   - To be fair though, Android has had the benefit
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.520]   of watching Apple and then following on.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:10.800]   So I would imagine that Andy Rubin and the Android guys
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.880]   are looking at the iPhone saying,
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.560]   "These notifications, we need really better notifications.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.440]   "Let's how could we do this right?"
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.200]   And so they have the, when you're second,
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.880]   you have the option to kind of learn from mistakes made
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.040]   by the guy taking the arrows.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.080]   - With funny, listening to what Tim was saying about Apple
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.080]   needing to kind of reboot it,
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.120]   reminds me of what happened in 1997
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.880]   when Apple, when the Mac operating system
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.680]   was getting a little old and they wound up acquiring next
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.560]   and getting a lot, I wonder if there's somebody out there
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.440]   who can, another Steve Jobs out there in the wings
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.320]   who can give Apple what it needs for iOS.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.160]   - Aren't we, this is an interesting question
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.640]   that's kind of always in the back of my mind.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.280]   Are we ever going to see a new operating system?
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.120]   Aren't we done?
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.760]   - Not for Microsoft, they're just going to keep up
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.200]   to any Windows, they basically said that
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.440]   I build this week that the next version
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.120]   which they're calling Windows anniversary of all things
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.680]   will come out July 2016 and it's just an update.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.920]   - Yep, you're renting it basically.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.720]   - No more Windows 10, no more Windows,
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.760]   you just, we'll just continue to update it.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.240]   You know the thing that worries me a little,
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.880]   so I feel like there's no B.O.S. waiting
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880]   in the wings I guess as well.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.520]   - Apple has work to do, first of all on the Mac side,
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.280]   they've got to come up with an answer for Cortana,
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.720]   they've got to put Siri on the Mac,
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.240]   I don't know what's taking so long.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.360]   - Siri sucks though, can I say this?
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.200]   - Well a better theory.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.720]   - Without getting people mad at me,
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.840]   every time, so Lisa uses an iPhone,
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.840]   I use an Android phone, every time Siri gets it wrong,
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.600]   says stupid things, Siri is, it's worse
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.280]   than the product they bought.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.200]   - Yeah, well especially compared to the M,
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.280]   it also compared to Alexa, you know,
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.240]   I just bought my third Alexa device,
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.280]   I have two Echo's and I have the tap,
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.120]   I've got the--
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.240]   - Echo doesn't do much though,
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.320]   thing is Echo's is not trying to do so much.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.280]   - It turns on my lights, in addition to playing music,
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.560]   it turns on, it locks my doors,
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.640]   I've got an integrated with my Vivint home security system,
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.000]   and it does it, and in fact I just wrote a piece
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.880]   that'll come out in Forbes tomorrow morning
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.480]   about the tap and my critique of the tap
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.080]   that you have to push a button, portable one.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.400]   - Do you have the new tap?
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.560]   - I do have it, actually--
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.960]   - Has anybody gotten the dot?
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.520]   - Oh here it is, I've got here's the tap right here.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.800]   - So this is like an Echo that's portable battery power.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.160]   - But here's how you have to go, I said, okay, well,
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.600]   I push button, who is Leo LaPorte?
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.360]   - Leo Gordonla, Port is an American technology broadcaster,
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.080]   author and entrepreneur.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]   - How's the speaker in that?
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.080]   Is it, it's not as good--
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.320]   - It's actually pretty good, is it?
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.160]   - Actually not quite as good as the bigger Echo,
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.760]   but it's very close, but the problem is,
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:39.440]   first of all, there was a little jack in here
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.400]   that I was hoping with a headphone jack,
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.680]   but it's audio input, which is really useless.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.120]   Why would you do the audio output?
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.440]   - That's not the speaker I want.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.040]   - And you've gotta push this button,
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.400]   which means you can't say Alexa, what time is it?
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.320]   - Like I can't remember. - From across the room.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.160]   I think that's-- - From next room,
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160]   I do it from my gift. - Yeah.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.000]   - I talk to my Echo in my living room,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   in my kitchen, when I'm watching TV
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.080]   in the living room, I just shout out.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.640]   - We have something like that, it's called Google or Siri,
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.960]   or I mean, Cortana, we don't need something
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.880]   where you push a button, we want our house to listen to us
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.040]   and respond without pushing any buttons.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.160]   - And it's hard, I want a car version of this.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.960]   I wanna be driving my Tesla and just telling you
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.320]   what I wanna listen to.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.080]   - That's coming. - My key for it.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.880]   - That's coming. - You know?
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.000]   - So if you look at the app, if you look at the app
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.640]   for Alexa on the iPhone, I presume there's one for Android.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.200]   - There is. - If you look at the app,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:46.600]   there is in there a history of the question-
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.240]   - That's the best thing for it's trigger word.
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.880]   And we were talking about encryption and the police
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.280]   and having access to that.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.440]   If it's always listening.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:03.240]   - No, no, no, no, you're misunderstanding that
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.840]   because the only audio you have here
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.720]   is the audio after you said the trigger word.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.000]   - Theoretic. - But it's always listening
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.440]   for the trigger word, so suppose that--
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.600]   - But it's not smart enough to understand anything
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.760]   but the trigger word, it's just not doing matching.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.920]   - Well, it's not smart enough, it's not programmed.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.720]   If you want to get paranoid and evil--
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.720]   - I agree. - You have a good microphone in there
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.960]   and the FBI could go to Amazon and say,
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.680]   would you turn on always listening on Leo's Echo
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.080]   'cause we'd like to have a bug in his house?
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.320]   But I would point out that you have microphones all over you.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.520]   - Your phone has the same microphone, right?
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.760]   - Except there's no guarantee that the phone is always listening
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.040]   because you could turn that off.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.840]   If someone knows you have an Amazon Echo in your home,
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.120]   it is always listening and you can't turn that off.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120]   - No, you can't turn it off.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.960]   There's an on- - No, you can't totally.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.960]   You can unplug it just as you can turn your phone off.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.720]   - But I mean, if you're using it, if it is there--
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.160]   - Well, the same thing with your phone.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.520]   I mean, if somebody could-- - Yeah, okay, good.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:06.240]   - I pretty much sure that Google could send a signal
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.280]   down to my phone or put some software on my phone
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.040]   that would automatically turn the microphone on
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.840]   and have it on and have it on and have it on, right?
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.120]   - It is on, you go to the home screen of your Android phone
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.840]   and say, okay, Google-- - Yeah, I know.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.440]   - We'll respond. - But don't confuse,
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.480]   so here's the difference.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.600]   Always listening is not the same
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.320]   as sending it back to the home office.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.320]   - Right.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.160]   - So I don't care if it's always listening
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.640]   'cause all it's doing is churning through the voice pattern
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.760]   to see if it matches the voice pattern of okay, you know who.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.600]   - Right, and I'm not talking about--
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.840]   - But I worry about it sending it back to the home office
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.720]   and that it does not do and although theoretically,
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.440]   you could if-- - Right, right.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.280]   - Right. - Good.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.120]   - And declare by some-- - I know--
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:41.960]   - I know-- - I'm looking at,
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.600]   looking at what the FBI did with Apple,
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.720]   going to Apple and saying, "Build us an OS
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.480]   that lets us get in."
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.560]   They could easily do that with other companies--
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.960]   - Yes. - Including--
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.440]   - And may have done that.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.640]   - And may have done it with Amazon, yes.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.440]   - A number of companies started doing,
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.520]   "Ken--" warrant, "Kenerys," Apple did one,
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.320]   and Reddit did one, where they say,
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.320]   "To this date, no, we have received no national security letters
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.760]   to reveal information about Redditors, except that--"
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.760]   And the theory of that is, as long as you see that,
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.240]   in their transparency report, that's true,
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.160]   it disappeared this week.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.680]   So that's a warrant, "Kenerys,"
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.360]   the absence of which means,
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.520]   we now know Reddit has received a national security letter.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.680]   So I love warrant, "Kenerys,"
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.480]   but we know that this stuff's going on all the time,
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.120]   that companies that receive NSLs are forbidden,
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.840]   in many cases, from revealing that publicly,
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:38.720]   which is why they resort to things like warrant, "Kenerys,"
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.680]   could very well be, Amazon is already turning on echoes
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.520]   for people in their houses.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.040]   We don't know, we will never know,
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.960]   because of the way our secret courts work,
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.480]   which is a shame and a travesty.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.360]   - So that's one of the-- - And of course,
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.440]   the only one member, they took a,
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.040]   they took encryption out of their tablets,
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:12:59.880]   and they put it back in,
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.280]   remember they had a big reaction,
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.520]   when they temporarily announced
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.360]   that they were removing encryption,
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.080]   and they put it back, and part of the reason
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.960]   they put it back, I think, is because people were concerned,
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.640]   even though it had nothing to do with the echo,
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.360]   I think there was a bit of a backlash,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.800]   you know, that Amazon is in the business
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.360]   of creating devices that are constantly listening to us,
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.000]   or are able to constantly listen to us.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.400]   - You know what worries me about Apple,
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.320]   is that they released a very minor evolutionary,
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.840]   and with some fanfare evolutionary upgrade
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.520]   to the iPhone and the iPad,
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.800]   and said nothing about updating their long overdue
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.720]   computer systems.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.480]   They haven't put Skylake in, for instance,
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.880]   the latest Intel processors,
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.080]   even though most Windows PCs now are available in Skylake.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.280]   - Or touch screens.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.360]   - Or touch screens.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.200]   - Yeah.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.680]   - I'm scared, because I really like using Apple's products,
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.400]   and they better watch out, you know why?
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.720]   We're gonna take a break and come back
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.320]   and talk about the bash prompt coming to Windows 10.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.120]   - It's the year of the Linux test.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.480]   - It's finally!
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   (laughing)
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.520]   - Finally here!
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.240]   I showed today brought to you by something
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.680]   that you should be listening to,
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.120]   audible.com, the best audio bookstore in the world.

[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.800]   I say listen to my book, it starts reading to me.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.240]   This is a revolution in audio.

[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.800]   But I have a feeling that like me,
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.720]   I met an Audible user subscriber, listener for 16 years.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.080]   You will find much to listen to.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.640]   I see Stephen Levy's classic hackers.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.520]   It's 25th anniversary edition is now out on Audible.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.960]   If you haven't read this book, get it on Audible right now.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.080]   It is amazing.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.120]   As long as you're listening to that,
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.520]   Kitty Haffner's fabulous history of the internet,
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.720]   where wizards stay up late,
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.600]   another must listen to books.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.440]   There's lots of books about technology on Audible.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.280]   I know a lot of you are into sci-fi,
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.440]   because they know that you like science fiction.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.800]   Audible created something they call
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.240]   the Audible Frontiers program to record audio versions
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.760]   of all the great science fiction classics,
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.480]   books that came out years ago,
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.480]   before audio books were even a twinkle in the eye.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.680]   And I have to say, listening to the Heinlein
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.680]   and the Azimov, this is the best library of stuff.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.040]   Oh, everybody's raving.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.120]   I haven't listened to it yet.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.080]   The Star Wars movie, the novelization,
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.080]   people say if you have questions from the movie,
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.520]   the novelization is awesome.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.040]   Haven't read it yet.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.520]   But I do invite you to try it out.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.680]   Two books free, audible.com/twit2.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.800]   Subscribe today,
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.200]   and you'll probably be listening to less fewer podcasts,
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.360]   but what the hell?
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.080]   Audible, I can survive.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.000]   Just come back and listen.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.920]   Look, Tony Tenil, The Captain in Tenil, a memoir.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.400]   Aw, aw, audible.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.120]   See, they get everything.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.840]   What with Lisa and I were listening to such a great book
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.360]   the other day, this is the other thing I love to do.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.280]   My wife and I like to listen to audible books together.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.880]   Let me go, you know how I know what we were listening to
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.480]   'cause we were listening on the Alexa.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.120]   I can look at the Alexa history here
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.000]   and see what it was.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.840]   It was a great story.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.640]   We love you in the echo for audible.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.480]   Isn't that cute?
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.600]   Just listening as a couple.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.400]   Instead of watching TV, oh, this is it.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.880]   The prettiest one.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.120]   It's a new thriller by James Hankins.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.880]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.200]   Yeah, it's fun to listen together.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.120]   Well, sometimes we'll get in bed
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.920]   and we'll just listen to an audible book on our echo.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.720]   Audible.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.440]   The Amazon listening to you is well at the same time.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.880]   If it wants to, it's more than welcome.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.880]   The snoring is gonna go on all night audible.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.880]   I mean, echo, you might as well just audible.com/twit
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:49.480]   and the number two, two free books waiting for you.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.600]   And I love it 'cause every book I've ever bought an audible
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.440]   is in my library.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.120]   So I go back often and listen to some of the classics
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.040]   that I bought, you know, in 2001 or 2002.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.480]   Having a great time on Twit this afternoon,
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.520]   Tim Stevens from The Roadshow@theroadshow.com.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.800]   That's the new, how many episodes you have now
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.120]   under your bell?
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.600]   We've done I think about six high-end videos
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.600]   and a ton of reviews on some other good stuff as well.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.080]   If you want to know about the Model 3,
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.240]   that's where you'll find Tim's great review
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.320]   and he talks about the event, lots of information,
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.000]   but also the Bolt.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   Also, your favorite automotive pranks from April Fools.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.440]   Yeah, we had a lot this year and a couple old dad tell,
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.280]   we're not April Fools jokes, but should have been.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.960]   - This is Honda's emoji license plates.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:37.840]   I would like an emoji.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.880]   I think it's just a matter of time.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.400]   We have emoji license plates in California, right?
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.600]   Do we have a few different symbols you can use?
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.440]   - Symbols, yeah.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.280]   - Yeah, those are okay.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.200]   - And then to the cops,
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.840]   great goes down if they give you a ticket.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.040]   - That's a really good question.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.880]   What are they right?
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.480]   They must have some sort of code.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.520]   Happy face, smiley face, 365.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.600]   - I have a feeling that the code of an edition
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.120]   is not relevant to how they look.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.480]   - Maybe they leave it out.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.320]   - I don't know.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.160]   - I don't know.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.000]   - I'm a cop.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.760]   - If there's a California Highway Patrol Officer listening,
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.680]   please let us know.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.400]   Lexus had a VLCRO seat.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:18.480]   It's the variable load coupling rear orientation seat.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.040]   It's exactly what it sounds like,
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.240]   a Velcro covered seat
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.680]   and you put your kid in Velcro clothing
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.000]   and they're safe.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.320]   (laughing)
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.520]   What do they do then in that?
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.800]   Where do they do that?
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.320]   - It was just an April Fool's job video
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.640]   where they had some, I mean, for a race driver,
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.480]   it actually kind of almost makes sense,
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.200]   but yeah, that was another quote unquote,
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.040]   funny April Fool's.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.640]   - Oh, so it wasn't a child safety seat,
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.760]   it was a race car safety seat.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.280]   - You gave the Google self-driving bicycle
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.360]   video that they did?
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.440]   - Self-driving bicycle.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.480]   - Yeah, it came out of Google and Amsterdam,
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.520]   the hysterical.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.880]   Google used to, it almost felt like for a while
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.760]   that that's all Google employees did all year long
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.880]   is prepare for April Fools.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.720]   - Yep.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.880]   - That, I think is changing.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:04.960]   They haven't been doing as many
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.320]   and after their mic drop April Fool's Gmail prank,
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.080]   I don't think they're gonna be doing a lot more.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:11.920]   - It should be okay.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.320]   It seems like they went overboard a little bit.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.160]   - Yeah.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.000]   - They've been going overboard a little bit
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.600]   with the Google logos every day too in my humble opinion,
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.000]   but yeah, this one, look,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:20.840]   I face this a little bit,
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.200]   so maybe they'll rethink things.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.120]   - I couldn't figure it out.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.120]   What was funny about it?
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:24.960]   - So, yeah.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.800]   - What do I miss?
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.400]   - So, we didn't see it on the West Coast
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.240]   because it was so horrifically a failure
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.280]   that they killed it before we woke up.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.360]   But maybe you saw it, Tim, what happened?
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.000]   - Basically, there was a button in Gmail
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.240]   that you could click to add a GIF
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.240]   of one of the despicable me helper dudes
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.440]   dropping the mic and turning away
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.160]   and that would be the,
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.080]   it would be a space would be your email
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:50.920]   and that would be it.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.120]   And it was really easy to click that
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.440]   instead of the send button.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.080]   And so someone mocked up an email
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:59.160]   in which they were replying their condolences
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.000]   about someone's death,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:00.920]   I believe it was,
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.400]   and they clicked that button incorrectly.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.160]   And so it was a mic drop GIF
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.720]   which is not exactly a nice--
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.560]   - Well, it was easy too.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.680]   As you can see, if you're watching the video,
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.480]   the way Google's always done it on Gmail,
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.480]   you have a send button
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.320]   and then to what's right,
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.000]   a send an archive button.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.520]   They replaced the send an archive button
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.480]   with a send and mic drop,
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.480]   but it doesn't say mic drop,
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.920]   but it just has a kind of a obscure icon
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.000]   of what is obviously,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.840]   once you know dropping microphone.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.320]   Many people who are in the habit
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.520]   of hitting send an archive just hit it.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.800]   So two bad things happen.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.480]   First, your serious email has a minion in it
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:32.320]   with an animated GIF
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.880]   with a minion dropping a mic,
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.720]   but you know, I didn't experience this,
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.320]   but apparently you could also not respond to that email.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.600]   It basically prevented replies
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.200]   or you would never see the response
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.480]   'cause it's a mic drop, right?
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.760]   I'm done, I've said everything I'm gonna say.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.520]   - And there was a bug
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.840]   where if it didn't go through
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.480]   and you sent another email after that,
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.320]   that email would have the mic drop.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.680]   - Oh my God.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.440]   - And so there were emails that went out with the mic drop
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.120]   that weren't supposed to happen.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.000]   - Terrible.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.520]   - You know, April Fools on the internet,
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.360]   you know, was kind of funny for a while,
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.680]   but so often the jokes don't work
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.440]   and they're just more annoying than funny
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.520]   and it's, you know, it's that old line
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.800]   about dying is easy, comedy is hard.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:22.640]   - Yeah.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:26.120]   - And it's just, you know, I can do without it at this point.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.280]   - Did you guys get a memo telling you not to fall
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.120]   for April Fools jokes that people wouldn't be called?
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.440]   - Did CBS in that?
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.680]   - Yeah, apparently something went around the newsroom,
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.760]   you know, just basically.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.080]   - Just a reminder.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.640]   - Reminder watched it, it's the main picture of the story.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:40.480]   (laughing)
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   - Of course it's getting like half a dozen pitches
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.240]   from random PR agencies saying,
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.360]   hey, look at this hilarious April Fools joke
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.960]   that my company is gonna be doing tomorrow.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.640]   I'll give you the information under embargo
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   if you'd like to write about it.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.640]   It's like, no, I don't want to know.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.480]   - No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.880]   - You take me off of whatever list did you find like it?
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.360]   - No.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.880]   Somebody, some wag said April Fools is the only day
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.320]   of the year where people don't believe everything
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.560]   they read on the internet.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.320]   (laughing)
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.000]   I kind of like the Google cardboard plastic prank though.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:08.840]   Did you see this one?
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.800]   This was just a video and they,
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   it's a new VR helmet that is lightweight,
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.360]   immersive because it gives you real reality.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.240]   It's just clear plastic and everything.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.600]   It's waterproof, and 360 degrees sound works with all apps.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.960]   (laughing)
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.200]   Okay, this was kind of funny.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.040]   - Yeah.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.600]   - Kind of funny.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.600]   Analogue Clock, which is a wristwatch.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.860]   (laughing)
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.960]   All right, but enough April,
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.200]   we managed to get survive April 1st one more time.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.640]   Thank goodness.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.360]   We did get the, and this is no prank.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.880]   Oh, by the way, I forgot to point this out.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:55.520]   Larry, you put your review of the original Macintosh,
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.520]   the LA Times review of the original Macintosh.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.240]   - Show the yellow, show the yellow screen.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.880]   That's hysterical.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.600]   You recognize what that looks like,
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.720]   old yellow newspaper.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.440]   - Newspaper does not last very long.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.200]   It's not designed to yellows,
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.400]   but it's nice that you still have this,
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.600]   and even nicer still that you saw it as a winner.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.440]   - I did.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.160]   If you can read, I rarely get excited over a new computer.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.200]   That's still true, but that really was an amazing moment.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.040]   - Oh, man.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.160]   - There's a line in there about how Apple,
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.240]   the young chairman, Steve Jobs,
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.360]   showed me this new computer.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.800]   - How nice, how fun.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.880]   - It was fun, yeah.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.880]   - The first time I saw Apple's young chairman,
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.680]   yeah, it's a blow of blame to company.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.760]   - The first time I saw Mac, I was at a party in Austin,
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.800]   and it had been out maybe about a year,
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.360]   and I had yet to see one,
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.800]   and I went into the, it was in the bedroom with this house
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.320]   where the person was having the party,
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   and I was so mesmerized by it,
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.960]   I went and I locked the bedroom door,
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.800]   and spent the entire evening out of the party
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.640]   playing with this man.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.160]   - Oh, man.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.880]   - Just at the beginning.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.640]   - Yes, oh yeah, I was like, oh my God.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.760]   - And many years later, Dwight,
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.560]   you wrote a book on helping Windows users switch to Mac.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.520]   I mean, that was not right after you wrote it.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.320]   - Yes, and running Windows on the Mac.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.360]   I did two of those.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.160]   And it was funny, the first time I saw
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:11.680]   an Apple computer store,
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:15.240]   'cause Apple actually had these affiliate stores
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.200]   when the Apple II came out.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.840]   I remember I was at a laundromat doing my laundry,
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.920]   and there was one open across the parking lot,
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.840]   and I thought, why would anyone want a computer
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.840]   in their home?
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.040]   (laughing)
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.720]   It was my first reaction.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.840]   - Who's that?
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.640]   - That's from The Verge, it's Deeder Bon.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:33.840]   - Oh, Deeder Bon of The Verge.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.360]   Well, here's a picture of Larry Maggot
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.440]   with his Apple II in 1981.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.880]   What a good-looking fella, Larry.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.400]   - Maybe you saw me in a suit, I believe.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.400]   (laughing)
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.240]   - That's it.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.240]   That is a great picture.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.840]   And apparently they flew the, I like this.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.920]   Apple flew the pirate,
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:50.600]   off to ask Bill Atkins in about it tomorrow in triangulation,
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.080]   flew the pirate flag over their headquarters.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.760]   Of course, the pirate flag was the flag Steve Jobs
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.200]   very famously flew above the skunk works
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:04.680]   that was developing the Macintosh in the face of
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:08.120]   a lot of opposition from John Scully, the CEO,
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.440]   and the shareholders and Apple II lovers
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.800]   who were afraid that the Macintosh
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.360]   would cannibalize the Mac.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.280]   - What did that, the original flag,
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.320]   that they were flying there?
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.280]   Did they fish that out of the closet
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.480]   and fly the original one?
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.000]   - That's a good question.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.240]   It's got the Rainbow Apple logo,
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.260]   which means it's not the current Apple logo.
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:34.080]   That's a really good question.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.200]   Wow.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.200]   Somebody must have that.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.520]   Somebody must have that.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.400]   When the Apple II people would fight back to--
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.320]   - They had a conference.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:44.040]   I remember that in San Francisco called Apple II forever
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.720]   right before they killed the Apple II.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.640]   - That's exactly right.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.560]   (laughing)
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.800]   - But if you remember,
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.840]   and if you saw the Steve Jobs movie,
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.400]   which was of course historically insanely incorrect,
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:02.600]   but I think it's somewhat true
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.320]   that one of the reasons Jobs got fired from Apple
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.120]   was because he basically was killing the Apple II
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.240]   with a new computer that wasn't gonna sell
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.680]   and was costing way too much money.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.440]   I remember looking at the Lisa at the store,
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.640]   I think at $10,000.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.480]   I'm not buying that,
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.640]   but when the Apple II came out,
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.480]   $2,500 seems so much cheaper.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.000]   I mean, the Mac came out,
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.440]   then I ran out and got it.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:32.120]   Oh, wow, we've looped in on ourselves.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.200]   I apologize.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.560]   Let's talk about this.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.560]   - Like instant loop.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.960]   - It is, one infinite loop.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.960]   A little battle between the Nest folks
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.500]   and the drop cam folks,
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.000]   the drop cam, former drop cam CEO said,
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.400]   Nest should stop blaming drop cam for its bad results.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.960]   We're the only thing that saved Nest.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.000]   And then, Nest saying,
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   ah screw it anyway, Nest struggling
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.800]   because we now see the results.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.840]   After spinning out all of its companies,
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.440]   Google companies into the alphabet companies,
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.280]   now these companies results are not hidden
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.480]   under Google's results.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.240]   And we're starting to see some trouble in paradise.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.920]   The Nest is not selling well.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.840]   The hardware chief,
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.880]   Shiga Hanjo and Scott Mullins,
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.120]   the senior engineering manager
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.400]   are leaving the company,
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.800]   maybe leaving the country too, I don't know.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.080]   Nest is underperforming.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.880]   Now, $340 million in revenue doesn't sound terrible,
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.960]   but they were hoping,
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.360]   Google was hoping for half a billion.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.360]   They did don't forget paid $3.2 billion for Nest in 2014.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.720]   Trouble in paradise?
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.560]   Why is the Nest not doing so well?
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.120]   Is it over for Nest?
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:53.200]   - Well, it was up with a smart home trend.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.080]   I mean, we've been talking about how great Alexa
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.080]   isn't all the great things that that does.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.080]   And there's no reason that the Nest couldn't
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.960]   be doing the same exact thing.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:04.280]   You know, it's got ties to Google technology.
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.720]   It's got ties to everything that you need.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.760]   You could be tied into your, you know,
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.720]   Google One and Google Now and everything else.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.280]   But instead, it's just still a thermostat
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.640]   that ties to a smart spoke detector
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.440]   and a few other things.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.160]   And that's about it right now.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.720]   You know, they had a huge leap,
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:22.960]   a huge advantage over all these other smart home devices.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.360]   And they've kind of stayed stagnant for the past 12,
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.200]   for 18 months.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.040]   And that's way too long.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.920]   - I had Nest, I had two Nests in my old apartment.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.520]   And we moved, I didn't bother connecting them up.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.320]   I didn't see any real value to it.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.160]   - Right.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.000]   See, that's how I feel about it.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.600]   I mean, a thermostat, okay, what does it do?
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.000]   It has a network connection.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:41.880]   Is that really a big deal?
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.040]   So I just had Vivint put in for review purposes,
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.160]   this home security home automation system for me.
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.120]   And they offer the Nest at a premium price,
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.280]   but they have their own thermostat
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.920]   that's controlled by Z wave.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.440]   And it's pretty simple.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.760]   I don't, I can't figure out why I would want
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.120]   to spend extra for a Nest.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.440]   - 250 bucks, right?
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.480]   - I mean, it just doesn't, I just can't get it.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.560]   I mean, because, I mean, even this one is overkill,
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.800]   'cause I can remotely adjust the temperature
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.880]   in my house over the internet.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.960]   Even that's something, after trying it out,
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.480]   I never actually would normally do,
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.880]   because a regular thermostat does a pretty good job.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.520]   So, and even the smoke detectors,
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.440]   there are others on the market besides Nest.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.800]   They don't have anything,
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.440]   that they don't have anything proprietary
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.600]   in terms of what they accomplish.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.800]   - Well, there's a lot of competition in all of those areas.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.880]   And at least in the Vivint product and some of the others,
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:31.960]   it's an integrated system.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   So it does everything it locks the door.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.280]   It turns lights on and off.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.320]   And there's all these rules you can set on your phone.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.640]   - Yeah, but who needs it?
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.480]   (laughs)
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:42.800]   - Well, are you right?
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.480]   - I like being able to unlock my front door
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.040]   without having to be the key.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:46.880]   I mean, I--
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:47.720]   - I worry about that.
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.560]   - Well, you worry about it.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.560]   Yeah, I worry about that too.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.960]   - Yeah.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:54.800]   Of course, the battle between Tony Fadel, CEO of Nest,
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.600]   he gave an interview to the information
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.480]   disparaging Dropcam.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.600]   So Greg Duffy, the guy who founded Dropcam
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   and sold it to Nest in 2014 for half a billion dollars,
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.320]   wrote a post on Medium this week saying,
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:13.400]   I would almost find such blatant scapegoating amusing
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:16.360]   if it weren't so insulting to the team.
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.400]   Given that I feel--
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.480]   Now these are two people at working at the same company.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.640]   Given that I feel compelled to set the record straight
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.240]   just before we were acquired,
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.320]   Dropcam was in the middle of a record year
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.520]   sales, had a four and a half star
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.800]   best selling camera on Amazon,
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.880]   was rolling into large brick and mortar retailers
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:33.520]   with huge merchandising support,
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.800]   had innovative new products,
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.920]   imminently launching, still had most of its financing
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:39.520]   in the bank and our investors and team actively
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:44.200]   didn't want to sell, it was my mistake to sell.
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.960]   But that's a story for another day.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:46.800]   Ooh, no.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.200]   Trouble in paradise.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:53.800]   Or maybe it isn't paradise after all.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.880]   (laughs)
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:01.520]   Maybe it's not so great as after all.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:04.040]   It kind of, we knew this would happen.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.280]   It's one of the reasons they spun off into Alphabet, right?
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.080]   Is so that companies couldn't hide
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.720]   under the Google umbrella so much.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.560]   Right.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.120]   Companies would have to rise and fall on their own merits.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:16.600]   She's a bit of a shame because that's part of the joy
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.840]   of Google, you know, as all those Project Xs,
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.960]   all those Pixel had projects that were so great
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.800]   and you knew it weren't making any money
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.320]   and weren't gonna be making money for two years
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.400]   or maybe even five years
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:28.000]   and maybe even longer, but they were doing really cool stuff.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.920]   And, you know, they see Boston Dynamics now moving away
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:34.200]   and, you know, Boston Dynamics was doing amazing stuff.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.000]   You know, still driving car research.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.360]   That's not gonna make Google any money for a long time.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.720]   So that's, or Apple, Alphabet, I should say,
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.200]   not gonna make them any money for a long time.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:45.000]   So that's, I think a little bit disappointing
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.960]   in terms of the way that they've ultimately fragmented
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.760]   the company and, you know, I'm curious to see
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.640]   what the net result is down the road.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.680]   It certainly makes them a more sophisticated company.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.800]   And certainly if you are a more conservative investor,
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.760]   I think it makes the decision a little bit easier for you.
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.920]   But in terms of, you know, all these great moonshot projects
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:03.040]   that we all love Google for doing,
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.280]   it definitely makes that a harder proposition.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.440]   - I was talking to Brad Sam's.
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:09.400]   We had a meetup at after build on Friday.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.800]   It was a really great meetup.
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.360]   That's fair, buddy who was there.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.400]   Thank you for showing up.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.240]   A lot of fun.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:15.080]   Brad Sam's was there.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.520]   He's the editor of Therat.com and Petri.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.680]   And he said his theory with Google is the problem Google has
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.600]   and it's probably a problem that Alphabet has
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.800]   in general is that engineers are allowed to move on
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.240]   to whatever project interests them.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.280]   And so it's very easy for Google to launch exciting new things
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.520]   a lot harder for them to keep the team together
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.280]   after it's launched because then the innovators go,
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.800]   okay, what's next and move on?
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.800]   And meanwhile they've got, you know,
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.320]   Wave or Google Plus or whatever
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.920]   when nobody wants to work on it 'cause it's done.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.080]   And so nobody maintains it, updates it.
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:55.440]   And so Google's ADD problem, which is very obvious,
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.480]   yeah, really comes from that.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.840]   How many great services have they killed over the years?
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:02.840]   I remember they launched a Google Pay credit card
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.400]   where you could basically aggregate your credit cards
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.400]   together into one credit card.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.240]   Just killed it.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.840]   And they just killed this past weekend,
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.200]   which, you know, actually I had one
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.920]   I never used it to be honest with you.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.520]   But I mean, that's a cool idea.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.200]   That could have been great that Google launched
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.760]   and never put any muscle behind it.
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:17.760]   And then it died.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.080]   I'm really still nervous that Google Voice
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:20.920]   is gonna go away.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.160]   I was thinking the same thing.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.560]   I'm dependent on Google Voice.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.480]   It's the only phone number I give out.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.000]   I love it, but I worry that it's gonna go away
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000]   at some point.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   And there's a project,
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.120]   and there's a little indication that you might be right
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:36.800]   because when you get Fi, which and I use Fi,
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.880]   Fi is great, by the way.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.920]   It's the least expensive service I use.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.120]   For traveling, especially overseas.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.360]   'Cause you get free unlimited calls and texts
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.960]   and the data you pay as you go.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.680]   And it's very, you know, it's 10 bucks a gigabyte,
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.160]   but they do fractional.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.040]   And when you're overseas, you get free slow data,
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.800]   free unlimited international texts
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.040]   and 20 cents a minute phone calls.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.800]   It's T-Mobile's same service.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.280]   But here's the one thing that's cool about Fi.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.320]   So I have a Fi that I keep on pause
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.120]   because I only use it when I'm traveling overseas.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:03.960]   You could do that?
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.440]   I don't, so I just pause it.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.880]   I can do it on the app.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.720]   And then when I go overseas, I activate it
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.360]   and pause it when I get home.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.360]   Well, but when you went to Fi,
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:15.480]   you had to port your Google Voice number over to it
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:17.400]   or have it discontinued.
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.660]   Or create another Google account, which is what I did.
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:21.280]   Yeah. I have a separate Google account.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.700]   So I ported my number over.
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:26.920]   So you had to create it under a separate Google account.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.760]   Exactly.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:30.440]   Yeah. And I'm worried that now it's a Fi.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.400]   Now, in fact, if you go to voice.google.com
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.400]   once you, now you get redirected to Fi.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.720]   But at the very bottom in Fi, print,
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.880]   there's a link to Google Voice
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.640]   where you still have all the Google Voice features
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.520]   you used to have, but you have to find it.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.640]   And if Fi opened it, if I open to anybody now, right?
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.480]   It is.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.840]   But you have to have the phone.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.500]   And when you buy a Nexus phone,
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.500]   then you can sign up for Fi.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.380]   Right. Yeah.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.460]   Well, those are good phones.
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:56.780]   The 6P, the 5X, the Nexus 6.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.700]   They're decent phones.
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.620]   Not as good in my opinion as the S7.
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.340]   This is, to me, this is the phone of the year.
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:04.180]   So--
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.540]   My S7 is embedded permanently in my--
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:07.380]   (laughing)
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.380]   And your gear VR.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:09.220]   Yeah. Exactly.
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.140]   Well, how'd you get the gear VR that fits the 7?
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.380]   Is that the generic one?
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.460]   It fits.
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:14.300]   I just, yeah.
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:15.140]   No, it just--
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.180]   Is that the old 6, S6 one?
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:22.000]   No, this is, as far as I know, the current VR,
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.240]   but it fits the X7.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:24.080]   It should be the one you get.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:27.800]   Yeah, they release the VR with the S6.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.400]   Yeah, but it's, you know, how it works.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.280]   I guess it would fit.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.040]   I'd say so. Yeah, it's the same size.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.240]   It's in here, like that.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.080]   Usually, I'm--
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:35.920]   You're just coming there.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.840]   Yeah, they got an email from them saying it's coming,
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.960]   but it's gonna take a long time.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.560]   If you want your money back, you can have it.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.040]   Yeah, the latest version has a notch
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.080]   that you can adjust for the size of the phone.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:45.920]   Okay. Right.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:46.760]   And then you can snap right and--
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.840]   Oh, I don't have that version.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:48.940]   I have the S6 version.
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:49.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.100]   Okay. You have the fixed version.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.680]   Right. I don't have the notch.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:54.880]   Well, I'll get the notch someday.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.660]   I like the Gear VR, but I don't need no more
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.020]   'cause I got an Oculus Rift.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:58.860]   If you're gonna--
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:01.780]   Take a break and talk about the Oculus Rift in just a bit.
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:04.660]   Our show brought to you today by FreshBooks.
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:06.760]   If you're a small business owner struggling
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.540]   with your taxes, it's April 15th.
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:11.720]   Soon, be advised that freaking out
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.360]   and burying your head in the sand will not solve
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.540]   your problems come April 15th.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.940]   What will help?
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:19.740]   You gotta bring a little FreshBooks into your life.
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:20.940]   FreshBooks.
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:23.660]   I remember when I first started using it in 2004
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.460]   and it's gotten better and better and better,
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:26.540]   really saved my life.
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.260]   It makes it easy to create invoices.
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.820]   Keep track of your receivables.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.840]   Know who's paid, when, who hasn't paid.
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.140]   FreshBooks also makes it easy if people don't pay
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:38.620]   or slow to pay 'cause they make those notifications,
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:39.860]   little emails that you send out,
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.740]   they do that automatically.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:42.900]   That's why on average,
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:46.060]   FreshBooks users get paid five days faster.
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.220]   They also save a huge amount of time on paperwork
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:50.180]   and come tax time.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:53.140]   They can zen their way through it.
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.500]   Even if you use an account and you're account
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.180]   and all of the FreshBooks reports,
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:58.140]   all your details in one place.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.380]   The mobile app lets you take pictures of receipts
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:01.680]   and organizes them for later,
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:05.260]   which makes claiming expenses at tax time a breeze.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.740]   You can even set up FreshBooks to import expenses
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:10.500]   directly from your bank accounts.
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:13.580]   They just announced their EMV chip card enabled card reader,
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:17.420]   which means you can now, a lot of people use FreshBooks
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:19.260]   who work at people's houses,
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.580]   like set up their audio system or plumbers
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.180]   or house inspectors.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:28.620]   Bring your FreshBooks, make an estimate,
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.780]   get the client to accept the estimate.
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:34.780]   When you're done, put the invoice right on your phone
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:37.420]   and then you pop in the card reader and they pay
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.340]   all without leaving the app.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:43.300]   It's already popular at IT professionals.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:45.660]   People do home computer repair and maintenance,
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:47.460]   all the trades.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.540]   So awesome.
[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:50.860]   Best part about using FreshBooks is the feeling
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:53.300]   that you'll have when tax time does come around
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.500]   and you got it, you got it.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:57.420]   Now, probably too late for this year, but for next year,
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:58.260]   try it.
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:02.540]   FreshBooks.com/twit, 30 days free.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:04.460]   Go to freshbooks.com/twit
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:06.260]   and when they ask you how you heard about it,
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:08.940]   would you please tell them you heard about it
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:11.380]   on this weekend tech so that we get the credit.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:16.340]   It's our great sponsors that make all of our shows possible
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:19.220]   and it's important that they know
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.700]   that you heard it here.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:24.260]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:26.220]   That's even more important now we're building,
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:29.100]   we have to, we're turning this into a brewery,
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:30.580]   believe it or not, just with Petaluma needs
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:33.660]   another beer brewery.
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.420]   They're turning our studio into a brewery.
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:37.820]   The designers are walking through the other days.
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:39.500]   - Knowing that, I will come in and do it.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:40.900]   (laughing)
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:41.820]   - We've found a new place.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:43.740]   The same size we could take everything with us
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:45.060]   but just moving them.
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:47.060]   We don't even have to read is a half a million bucks.
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:50.020]   So these sponsors make that possible.
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:51.140]   So thank you, FreshBooks.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.580]   I really, really appreciate that.
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:55.460]   One thing we'll definitely be taking with us
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:56.420]   is our Oculus Rift.
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:57.780]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:01.380]   But first, I made a little movie for you
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.900]   but all the fun we've been having this week on Twit,
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.580]   take a watch.
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:07.620]   - Previously on Twit.
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:11.900]   - We have spent more than $5,000 building
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.100]   the ultimate virtual reality gaming machine.
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:16.860]   (dramatic music)
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:20.460]   Oh, I'm gonna throw it.
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.380]   (laughing)
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:24.500]   This is way too realistic.
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.340]   - Security now.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:29.180]   - I introduced a new piece of Freeware,
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:34.180]   Never 10 offers an easy way to put the frees on Windows 10.
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.660]   - Can I just congratulate you on excellent marketing
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.620]   'cause that name is--
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:41.900]   - It's half the reason you're getting links, I'm telling you.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:45.540]   It's time for Windows Weekly, the Build Edition.
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:46.580]   Hey everybody.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.180]   - The early haircut's marker is in images
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:50.500]   and speaking right now, but thanks for telling.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.060]   - Let's talk about HoloLens.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:53.420]   - I feel like it's still better,
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.780]   but it's still definitely filled with you issues.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:57.820]   - This week in Google.
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:59.900]   - Do I have rice to privacy when I walk down the street?
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:02.740]   - No, but now think about the Google self-driving car.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:06.300]   It's not just mapping the world in 3D and in a point cloud.
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.220]   It's watching you.
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.940]   - This is a scary amount of new data that we have.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.460]   - And now these heat to scary.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:15.580]   - You cannot legislate around the emotion of scary or creepy.
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.380]   I don't like clowns, let's outlaw them.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.460]   - Oh, that sounds a good one, I'll sign up for them.
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:21.740]   - This is your brain.
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.300]   This is your brain on Twitch.
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:24.460]   Any questions?
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:27.340]   - It was VR week here, absolutely,
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:29.940]   but let's take a look at what's coming up next week.
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:30.780]   - Hey, thanks Leo.
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:32.940]   Here's a quick look at a few things we'll be following
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:35.700]   in the upcoming week and well, to be honest,
[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:36.580]   it's a pretty quiet week,
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:38.220]   but we have a couple of notable things.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.260]   First, Y Combinator's third annual
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:43.780]   female founders conference happens on Monday, April 4th
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:44.700]   in San Francisco.
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:48.180]   The event aims to empower women to become successful founders
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:50.420]   by just basically putting them in touch with those
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.340]   who have done so already.
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:54.300]   And on Tuesday, April 5th,
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:59.340]   the VR platform wars continue as HTC Vive begins shipping
[01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:01.340]   to customers with a commercial release
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:03.340]   of Oculus Rift this past week.
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.180]   This obviously means that consumers,
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:06.780]   more or less have a choice.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:07.980]   It's gonna be very interesting to see
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:09.900]   which platform reigns supreme.
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.820]   No doubt, there will be plenty more
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.940]   for Mega Moroni and I to discuss all week on Tech News today,
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:17.620]   every weekday at 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.900]   at twit.tv/live.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.300]   That's a look at a few things we'll be keeping an eye on
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.300]   the week ahead, back to you Leo.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:27.300]   - Thank you, Jason Howell, Mega Moroni Tech News today,
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.980]   every Monday through Friday.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.540]   I didn't realize the Vive is due out so soon.
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:33.140]   I have one of those on order too.
[01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:36.300]   We'll have by the end of this two Oculus Rifts and a Vive.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:38.260]   And I guess I'll have to buy a PlayStation 4
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.780]   and get one of them too.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.460]   - This is clear. - And a HoloLens.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.460]   - And a HoloLens, $3,000.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.260]   Those came out this week as well.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.740]   Clearly, and that's AR, but I think AR and VR,
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:51.180]   kind of hand in hand, aren't they?
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:55.260]   Is this a gimmick or is this really gonna make a difference?
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:59.340]   - Well, that was telling you Leo, I had a lot of fun.
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:02.060]   I didn't go out and spend even $1,600,
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:04.540]   which is kind of the minimum you need to spend
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.260]   for a PC and an Oculus Rift.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:07.820]   But I went over to Facebook the other day
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:09.900]   and I spent some time playing with it.
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:11.500]   And as I mentioned earlier, I've been playing a lot
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:15.340]   with this much less expensive VR gear.
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:19.180]   And I enjoyed it, but as somebody who's not a heavy duty gamer,
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:22.300]   it is not something that I would be willing at this point
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.420]   to invest a lot of money and time into.
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:25.860]   It's more like an experience.
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:28.060]   I mean, I almost wish there was an arcade
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:30.940]   you could go to and pay a couple of bucks every once in a while
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:31.780]   to play with it.
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:34.580]   You can set it up with a business in your new facility
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:36.420]   because I just think that the average person
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:40.060]   is not gonna get a lot of value out of it immediately.
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:43.660]   I think schools eventually can make incredible use of it.
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.660]   I can see lots of training, education,
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:49.940]   again, arcade kind of styles, but in terms of something
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:52.140]   that people wanna have in their home,
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:54.700]   and not at that price point, not quite yet.
[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:55.860]   - It is very expensive.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:59.860]   I mean, although here's a data point
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:02.860]   you might wanna keep in the back of your mind.
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:05.540]   Brian Shrout, who helped us build this kind of ultimate
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:07.820]   virtual reality gaming machine from PC perspective
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:10.020]   in our this week at Computer Hardware show,
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:13.340]   has built a kind of minimal machine
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:15.380]   that fits the minimal requirements of the Oculus Rift,
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:16.860]   as well as a fancy machine like this.
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:19.940]   He says that the experience is indistinguishable.
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:21.780]   And he says that's probably because developers,
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:24.540]   at least early on, are not writing for the high-end hardware.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.820]   They're writing for the guaranteed minimum.
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:30.300]   So John Slanino, our studio manager,
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.220]   is playing with it right now.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:34.100]   It's been pretty much constant use since we unboxed
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.780]   and set it up earlier this week.
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:40.180]   It's fun, but you're right, it's expensive fun.
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.940]   I paid a lot of money for that privilege.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:45.500]   - It's also, I think, still, it's cumbersome.
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:49.220]   It has, to me, I have played with some of these
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:53.980]   and it strikes me as being like the 3D glasses
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:55.340]   for home television.
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:58.260]   I don't think the average person wants a face hugger
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:44:59.980]   on their head.
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:03.500]   And I think that until it is lighter and smaller
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.980]   and maybe done in such a way that you don't actually need
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:11.060]   the box on your face, I don't think that the average person
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:13.100]   is gonna be very interested in this.
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.460]   - Yeah, the entertainment.
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:16.460]   - Even for entertainment, a lot of the,
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:19.140]   a lot of people who are using it say that this
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:22.300]   would be a breakthrough for motion pictures,
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:26.660]   as well as for games, and I'm not sure I see that.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:29.660]   - And also, everybody's amazing experience,
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.020]   which is a different thing.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:33.500]   I love lying down on the couch and watching a movie
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:35.740]   with my wife or we play co-op video games together,
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:36.780]   that kind of thing.
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:39.140]   You can't really do that in VR, at least not yet.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:41.300]   There will be co-op multiplayer games for sure,
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:42.820]   but even if you're sitting in the room
[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:44.780]   with someone playing VR.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:45.860]   - You're isolated, right?
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:46.900]   - You're on your own, yeah.
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:48.500]   And so that, I think, is gonna be big hurdle
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:51.580]   as we're moving beyond these initial gaming experiences.
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:55.420]   - Definitely, I also agree that education is a big thing.
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:59.140]   I mean, getting kids on the country to a major zoo somewhere
[01:45:59.140 --> 01:45:59.980]   is a difficult thing.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:01.660]   You can plop them down the middle of the Serengeti
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:04.860]   if you want to through an Oculus headset.
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:05.820]   But again, for those experiences,
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:08.300]   I don't think you necessarily need a $600 Oculus Rift.
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:10.380]   A Gear VR would be more than adequate
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.820]   to do that kind of experience.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:13.260]   And I'm actually really encouraged to see
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:15.100]   what kind of educational experiences come out
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:17.540]   of these VR systems, especially the ones that cost,
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:18.820]   you know, $100, $200.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.260]   - Well, the other thing, I thought the Gear VR
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:22.700]   and also the course of Google, is it itself contained.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.180]   I mean, you need the phone, but you're not tethered.
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:26.020]   - Right.
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:27.300]   - And part of the problem is you've got to be tethered
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:28.820]   to a PC with the Oculus Rift.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.460]   But I think that we're gonna see some standalone VR headsets
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:36.100]   in the two to $300 range that are gonna make a lot more sense
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:41.100]   for your average consumer than a $600 goggles,
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:43.140]   along with a $1,000 or more computer.
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:44.980]   But again, we're early in this.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:47.860]   So it's great that they're able to make these investments
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:49.140]   and see what happens.
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:49.980]   - Yeah.
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.500]   - We're early in this in the 90s when it first appeared
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:53.500]   and then vanished.
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:54.340]   - Yeah.
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:55.180]   - And there's a reason why that happened.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:56.660]   - This is not the first iteration, is it?
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.500]   - Right.
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:58.340]   - Right.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:01.060]   - I actually used to work at a VR arcade back in the mid 90s.
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:02.020]   I was only on my first job.
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:03.940]   So, you know, you mentioned "Jarting a couple bucks for it."
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:06.300]   That's exactly what I was doing back in the 90s
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:07.140]   and that went bust.
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:09.860]   - When my first experience with the Edcot Center,
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:13.700]   in 1994, I got to play with,
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:15.940]   I got a magic carpet ride and I was blown away.
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:16.780]   - Oh yeah.
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:19.420]   - And you know, and actually my favorite experience
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.020]   on so far on the Oculus Rift,
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:22.180]   I don't know if you've done it Leo,
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:24.180]   is the Eagle Flight where you fly over Paris
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:25.380]   and you fly under the bridge and--
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:26.980]   - No, I don't even know if we had that one.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:27.820]   - Oh, great.
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.540]   As a former pilot, I mean, to me,
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:32.260]   it gave me a lot of the same thrill I used to have
[01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:33.700]   when I used to fly real airplanes
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:35.460]   without the cost and danger.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:38.980]   So, you know, I think that's an amazing experience.
[01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:40.420]   The other thing that was really fun
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.980]   is one thing they do do with the wrist
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:43.700]   that you can't do with these portable ones,
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:46.740]   including the VR, is it has a way of sensing
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:48.900]   your body position, not just your head position.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.900]   So when the dinosaur walked up to me
[01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:52.420]   in one of the games I was playing,
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:53.540]   I was able to get under it
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.180]   and look at the dinosaur from the bottom,
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:56.420]   the top side. - That's kind of cool.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:57.260]   Yeah. - Absolutely.
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:47:59.660]   I actually literally felt like I'm touching it.
[01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:01.300]   And I don't know, if you had the experience of also stuff,
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:02.980]   there you go, they have the Eagle Flight.
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:04.300]   Have you had the experience of standing
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:06.860]   on top of a tall building and actually being afraid?
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:09.700]   - That one I did and we can walk right up to the edge
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.700]   and look down and use a little bit of vertiginous.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:15.180]   - I could not bring myself to actually step over the edge
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:18.580]   'cause viscerally, even though I knew I was in a room,
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:21.580]   viscerally, I felt like I was in the edge of a building.
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:23.540]   You know. - What would have happened
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:24.860]   if you did? - Nothing.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:26.900]   - Of course, I would have-- - And you know that.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.060]   I knew that intellectually.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:29.300]   - No, but what would you see?
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:30.700]   - I felt like-- - What's the experience
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:32.340]   they give you when you do that?
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.820]   - I didn't have to-- - Well, here,
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:34.660]   you gotta look at this.
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:37.300]   This is a Japanese VR game called,
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:40.580]   what is it, "Save, walk the plank and save the kitten."
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:45.460]   So the idea is, and this is gonna be an arcade,
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:48.820]   the idea is you're wearing a VIVE and headphones.
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:51.300]   You've got the touch controllers.
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:54.100]   And you see, these people are actually in a room
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.300]   on a plank, there's no risk to them whatsoever,
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:00.700]   but they're terrified because what they're seeing is
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:03.940]   a kitten, let me back up a little bit,
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:08.940]   a kitten on a plank projected over a very deep,
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:16.820]   you're a skyscraper, and so the experience is vivid
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:19.300]   for them, of they are in a risky position.
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:22.980]   And even though intellectually you know that you're safe--
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:25.340]   - That looks amazing. - Doesn't that look
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.580]   like a fun game?
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:28.460]   It looks terrifying to me, I don't--
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:31.380]   (laughing)
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:34.060]   I don't know if I wanna play it or not.
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:34.940]   - I think that kitten go.
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:35.780]   (laughing)
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:38.140]   - Go ahead, kitty, enjoy.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:39.500]   The kitten's gonna come back.
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.260]   - No real kittens have been harmed by this fight.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:42.620]   - The kitten is gonna come back.
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.820]   I don't think the kitten's as dumb as humans.
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.860]   No, you don't want--
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:49.540]   So John, did you feel, now you were just playing
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:51.540]   the Lucky's Tale.
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:54.580]   It's immersive enough that you feel like you're in the event,
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:55.420]   right, in the game.
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:56.740]   - It was weird, it was very weird.
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:58.700]   - Yeah, I love it.
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:02.100]   I love it, I feel like this, I'm at least for gaming,
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:03.260]   that this is a breakthrough problem.
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:05.260]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:06.660]   - And it is too expensive.
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:09.900]   But in some ways I regret that there,
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:12.060]   now Chris, our intern is there playing with it.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:15.140]   I regret some ways that people have experienced
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:17.340]   cardboard in Gear VR, which is not as rich
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:18.900]   as an experience to be honest with.
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:19.980]   - Right, right.
[01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.740]   - One thing that you don't--
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:23.460]   - Well, crack things open quite a bit
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:26.020]   because the cost of entry is a lot lower there
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:28.540]   and the developer support is bound to be huge
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:29.380]   when some of those things get out there.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.380]   And also the move controllers are quite inexpensive.
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:33.900]   Oculus doesn't even have their motion
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.420]   to set the controllers in the market at all.
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:37.260]   - And you need that, I think you've got it for a long time.
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:38.100]   - You wanna reach out.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:39.300]   - Definitely changes the game.
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.060]   I've played the London Heist game,
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:42.340]   which is one of the demos that they have
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:43.180]   for PlayStation VR.
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:45.260]   And you actually, you know, you have to crack a safe
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.100]   and open drawers and pick up a gun.
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.180]   And it's a really different feeling to actually,
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:50.380]   you know, hold your hand out in front of you
[01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:52.940]   and aim down the sights as you're shooting someone.
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:53.900]   That's a very different experience
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:56.180]   than just hitting the A button on the next box.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:58.220]   - But we only need to try one of these out.
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:00.340]   This is the Google cardboard, but the New York Times
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:02.420]   included the Sunday subscription.
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:04.420]   And I was actually disappointed.
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:07.220]   I was watching a New York Times video
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:10.300]   of an air drop in, I think, the Sudan.
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:12.220]   And I was watching this video
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:14.700]   or I was watching the, immersed in the VR.
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:18.100]   And I saw the package drop, but I forgot to look up.
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:21.340]   Or I didn't know to look up at where the drop was.
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:22.380]   And I was thinking about this,
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:24.540]   that if I were watching this as a movie,
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:25.940]   the director would have seen to it,
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:27.180]   a traditional movie, right?
[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.420]   The director would have seen to it
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:31.940]   that all the important information was in my field of view.
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.780]   But because this was virtual reality,
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:37.100]   I was in control of essentially where the camera was pointing.
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.780]   And I missed a very important aspect of it.
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:42.500]   And I think that if you're gonna use VR for storytelling,
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:43.940]   you have to really think about
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:46.500]   how do you prompt the user to look in the right direction?
[01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:47.340]   - Right.
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:48.660]   I think that's something that these directors
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:50.860]   will learn to do as this VR thing goes forward.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:52.980]   We've heard of Bass Spielberg being really excited
[01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:54.060]   about VR and looking into it.
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.820]   And we've done some experiments in VR.
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:59.540]   We shot a couple of car reviews in 360 video
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:02.260]   when we did a floor tour at the Geneva Motor Show
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:03.660]   in 360 video.
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:05.900]   And you really had to think about how exactly you're framing it.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.860]   We've got a lot to learn too from our end.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:09.940]   I can only imagine what a Hollywood producer has to learn.
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:12.820]   But video game designers and developers, for example,
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:15.180]   have learned to put bright colored objects
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:16.420]   in the path that you need to follow
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:18.660]   so that it kind of catches your eyes and move forward.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:21.380]   You can imagine Hollywood designers doing the same sort of thing
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:24.740]   and having little keys and little indicators that are subtle,
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:27.540]   but enough to get you to know it could be an audio cue
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:28.820]   or something that you need to look left,
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:30.140]   you need to look right.
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:31.820]   And certainly, hopefully you don't ever have to turn around
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:34.620]   in your seat because I could get pretty uncomfortable.
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:40.060]   And of course, Microsoft's HoloLens became a reality this week.
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:43.460]   People who spent $3,000 for the developer edition
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:47.900]   will start getting their HoloLens's soon.
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:52.900]   And AR is different from VR, but also similar.
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:54.740]   And I think part of the--
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.980]   I mean, of course, if you covered your eyes
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:53:00.940]   with an augmented reality headset, it'd be just like VR.
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:03.580]   I feel like both of these are very important technologies.
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:05.060]   These are new platforms, aren't they?
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:06.260]   I mean, that's what--
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:07.780]   And we just showed you.
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:11.260]   It was $2,500 for the first Macintosh.
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.860]   Of course, these are expensive initially.
[01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:14.700]   I agree with you.
[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:17.380]   PlayStation 4 is going to be the breakthrough product.
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:18.780]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:22.100]   HoloLens is hugely exciting from a future perspective.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.380]   I hope it doesn't take 30 years for that to get as affordable
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:27.340]   as a modern PC is now compared to an original app
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:29.180]   to or a Macintosh.
[01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:31.100]   But yeah, HoloLens right now has a lot of issues
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:33.420]   where it's not really ready for consumer adoption.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:34.620]   I don't think.
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:36.300]   But I can't think of anybody who
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.500]   wouldn't be excited with the prospect of being
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.220]   able to put on a pair of glasses that look a little bit
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:41.060]   less silly than that.
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:44.980]   And having a fully immersive experience projected
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:47.860]   on your eyeballs effectively over the top of the world
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:52.660]   around you, that also would help with the idea of this being
[01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:54.340]   an isolating experience.
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:55.620]   If you can see through this thing,
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:58.220]   you could be experiencing some sort of virtual
[01:53:58.220 --> 01:53:58.740]   out experience.
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:00.140]   There are also some interesting, engaged,
[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:04.140]   commercial applications like, for example, you look through the
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.940]   IKEA catalog and you see a couch.
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:06.900]   Well, OK, great.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:08.140]   We know what it looks like in a showroom.
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:10.540]   What would this couch look like in my living room?
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:11.620]   And you could actually do that.
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:14.700]   You could sit in your living room wearing an AR glasses
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:17.300]   and see that couch superimposed in your home.
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:20.700]   And there's some huge medical and educational industrial
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:21.620]   uses.
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:25.180]   I think from a practical standpoint, AR is way, way ahead
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:28.700]   of VR from an entertainment and gaming perspective.
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.340]   VR is obviously more fun, I think.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:33.740]   But I think there's a lot that we're going to benefit
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:35.820]   from augmented reality.
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:37.860]   Well, and I think gaming--
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:40.660]   I'm actually more excited about gaming with the HoloLens,
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:48.060]   because I would rather interact with the real world around me
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:50.420]   and then have that augmented for a game.
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:52.380]   To me, that's like--
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:55.420]   that is where you'll get some real imagination coming in.
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.380]   I think you'll see games that you haven't even thought of
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:02.460]   before and have not seen anything like in traditional gaming
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:03.660]   or in VR.
[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:05.060]   You know, it's funny.
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:06.740]   What do they call those arcades where you walk around
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:08.900]   with guns and their dark rooms?
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:09.860]   What am I playing?
[01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:10.860]   Laser tags.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:11.860]   Laser tags.
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:14.460]   Imagine playing laser tag with augmented reality,
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:16.380]   with what it would be amazing.
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:16.900]   Right.
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:18.460]   There's actually a constant video of someone
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:22.180]   who wants to create a laser tag like experienced in a warehouse,
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:23.500]   but with VR glasses.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:26.260]   So you'd walk up to a wall and you'd feel a wall,
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:30.020]   but you'd see this crazy tunnel inside of a spaceship
[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:31.140]   or something like that.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:34.780]   And so mixing an actual experience together
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:36.420]   with a virtual reality experience
[01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:38.140]   to create this sort of--
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:38.820]   here it is.
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:42.900]   Very well done-- to create this amazing sort of combined
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:44.060]   experience where you're actually walking
[01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:45.180]   through a very simple experience,
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.260]   but you're seeing something amazing.
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:49.700]   And that is, I think, a very exciting next generation
[01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:50.380]   arcade sort of thing.
[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:52.820]   I would pay a good amount of money to go around and shoot
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:53.820]   my friends and that kind of thing.
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:55.980]   In a week, you'll be able to go to a movie theater
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:58.660]   and watch a movie called Hardcore Henry.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:00.100]   You guys familiar with that?
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:00.780]   Yeah.
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:03.460]   This is interesting because I feel like this is--
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:06.420]   the creator is getting ready for this new virtual reality
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:06.780]   future.
[01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:09.340]   The idea is it's an action thriller,
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:10.780]   but it's shot in the first person.
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:12.340]   You are Henry.
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:13.980]   And I don't know what this is going to be like
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:16.860]   in a movie theater, but everything that in the movie
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.540]   is first person.
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:20.580]   It looks absolutely awesome, potentially a little bit
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.620]   nauseating, but they've already said
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:24.740]   that the second-- the sequel, which they have to make
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:26.780]   because there's so much buzz about this already--
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:29.500]   that the sequel will be in VR, which is awesome and exciting.
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.780]   But yeah, I mean, the tricks that they had to pull off
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:34.060]   to make this movie work--
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:36.300]   This is a VR movie without a helmet.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:38.700]   The question is, are you willing to wear a helmet for two
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:39.900]   hours to watch a movie?
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:40.380]   Yes.
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:40.900]   Are you?
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:41.860]   That's one question.
[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:44.300]   So let me tell you, when you play one of these games,
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:45.740]   it's so immersive.
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:47.900]   I could see you spending all day in these.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:50.020]   The Octos is not uncomfortable.
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:52.620]   And by the way, they've really improved the audio.
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:54.340]   So the sound is excellent.
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.620]   And now you don't get that with this.
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.380]   The sound is horrible.
[01:56:56.380 --> 01:56:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:57.620]   Great.
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:00.380]   So I really feel like two hours is not
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.020]   going to be that much to ask for--
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:03.780]   you're going to forget you're in this thing.
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:05.980]   That's what happens to me with the Oculus Rift.
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:09.420]   You very quickly become acclimated the idea
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:11.340]   that you're in this thing.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:16.860]   And it becomes, it's scarily real.
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:18.140]   Yeah, I'm super excited.
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:20.860]   Like I said, back in the '90s, when I worked at that VR arcade
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:23.180]   machine, I thought that was the future.
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:24.060]   I couldn't wait since--
[01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:26.220]   Why did it take off then?
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:27.780]   There just wasn't the technology at the time
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:30.020]   the latency was really low.
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:32.140]   Those virtual reality machines that they had in arcades
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:34.060]   cost $20,000 to $30,000.
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:37.380]   They were running 16 networks for 866s together
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:39.940]   to give you the kind of graphics power that you needed back then.
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:42.580]   There were VR headsets that were at home that weren't all
[01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:44.420]   that much more expensive than an Oculus is today.
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:46.580]   But there were VGA at best.
[01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:48.380]   And it was just a really poor experience.
[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:51.940]   And then I think when that failed, everyone wrote a VR
[01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:52.460]   altogether.
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:54.900]   And it was really thanks to Palmer Lucky, the individual,
[01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:58.900]   who was a VR nerd, who had all these VR headsets who
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:02.060]   realized I can take a tablet display, put it into a cheap
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:04.140]   headset with some duct tape and take some ski goggles
[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.620]   and kind of glue it all together and make this thing.
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:08.380]   And that's ultimately what became Oculus.
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:10.780]   And it's really thanks to him going back to what was this
[01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:13.780]   simple idea from the mid '90s and bringing it back again
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:14.820]   that everyone had written off.
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:17.740]   And now it's because of that that we have the Oculus Rift
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:19.940]   the Vive and the PlayStation VR and everything else,
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:21.900]   because everybody had written that technology off.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:25.980]   So Leo, we need to do a VR version of this week in tech in
[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:29.060]   which you can actually see and play and hold the goodies
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:30.620]   that we're talking about.
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:34.500]   We've already shot portions of two shows with the Nokia
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:38.940]   Ozo camera, which is a $60,000 immersive camera.
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.260]   It has eight cameras, but also eight microphones.
[01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:44.140]   I think audio is very important.
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:45.900]   We shot last week's Mac break.
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:47.940]   Alex Lindsey brought it by-- he's been reviewing it.
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:49.420]   We shot last week's Mac break weekly.
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:53.620]   And part of the new screensabers yesterday on that.
[01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:55.540]   Here's one of the problems.
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.660]   It's not only not real time.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:01.700]   It takes four hours to stitch one minute of video together.
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:06.300]   So they're still working on the video they shot on Tuesday.
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:09.100]   And we only shot like 10 minutes.
[01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:13.300]   So the workflow is a problem.
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:15.900]   But well, we're going to--
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:18.140]   we're in the earliest days of this.
[01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:20.780]   And I think there's enough appeal already.
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:23.540]   I mean, the idea of you being able to be in our show--
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:25.860]   by the way, when we built our studio and the new studio
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:27.820]   we're building, we're keeping this in mind
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:31.260]   that people will be looking behind as well as in front.
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:33.460]   Normally, a television studio or a movie set,
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:35.660]   there's nothing but garbage everywhere,
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:38.860]   but the 60 or 80 degrees you're seeing.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:40.620]   Well, no, we can't do it that way anymore.
[01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:42.540]   So everything in the sets now has to be--
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:44.900]   No, that's funny, Leo, because when Victoria Smith was
[01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:47.860]   on ABC News, she told me once that the hairdressers
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:50.060]   could only care about the front of her hair.
[01:59:50.060 --> 01:59:50.660]   Right.
[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:52.380]   They wouldn't even bother getting trimming
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:53.980]   the back of her neck.
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:54.980]   Guess what?
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:55.820]   More hairdressers.
[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:56.740]   Guess what?
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:58.820]   And they can't just stand on the edge of the shot
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:01.900]   to come in and give you a powder puff.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:02.500]   So we built it--
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:03.580]   I think Genus Smith, by the way.
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:05.060]   Genus Smith, yeah.
[02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:10.300]   Everybody is going to be able to see everything.
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:12.060]   And so you have to rethink everything
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:13.300]   when you're doing this stuff.
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:14.300]   But I feel like we are.
[02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:15.660]   So yes, I don't think you're going
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:18.660]   to see these shows in Immersive 360 this year,
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:19.980]   or probably even next year.
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:22.660]   But I admit, when we build a new set,
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:24.660]   that's one of the things we're keeping in mind.
[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:25.660]   You have to walk for--
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:26.900]   By 2020, it'll be common.
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:28.620]   I use a Theta right now.
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:29.460]   The Theta asks.
[02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:33.220]   The Rico Theta asks, which shoots in 360 degree video.
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:35.380]   And I can get it out to you in 10 minutes later,
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:37.180]   because the quality is a little bit lower.
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:40.420]   And I shot a lot of video on our last vacation,
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:41.300]   an Immersive video.
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.580]   If you go to my YouTube account,
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:45.620]   youtube.com/leo-loport, you can see it.
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:47.900]   It's not perfect by any means.
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:52.140]   But you immediately see some of the issues
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:54.500]   that you're going to have to solve, like this idea,
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:58.300]   that everybody is visible in everything.
[02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.980]   So I'm doing a vlog here.
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:01.820]   I'm standing here.
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:03.620]   But I don't have to point the camera anymore,
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:07.820]   because everything around me is visible from the sky above
[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:10.740]   to the water below.
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:12.660]   It's all there.
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:15.820]   And that's, I think, for an O-TUR, or a creator,
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:19.700]   or even just a vlogger, that's fascinating.
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:20.100]   And this is--
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:21.780]   But if you have to get clearances from everybody
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:22.620]   who's in the shot.
[02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:25.020]   Nah, I didn't bother with that.
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:26.420]   $350 camera.
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:27.380]   $350.
[02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:31.260]   And the tools are available on Mac and PC
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:32.860]   and smartphones and tablets.
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:34.340]   You can already just do this.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:37.460]   I could do it on an iPad and have it out on my blog.
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:41.780]   And because YouTube and Facebook both support this video,
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:46.900]   and that means you can watch it with a cardboard or a gear VR,
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:49.140]   in some ways, the tools to do this
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:52.060]   are here at a highly affordable.
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:56.500]   I mean, this is going to happen pretty quick.
[02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:59.980]   I feel quicker than maybe we even realize.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:01.100]   This is a new platform.
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:02.820]   I was talking on the radio show that today
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:04.700]   about the new platforms.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:06.660]   When you look at Apple and you look at these companies,
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:09.660]   they've been around 40 years or 15 years in the case
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:13.460]   of Google or Facebook 10 years in the case of Facebook.
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:14.500]   These are mature companies.
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.660]   But the future is being invented right now
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:18.300]   by a number of companies.
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:19.660]   And they're on new platforms.
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:21.580]   I don't think we're talking about operating systems so much
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:22.340]   as we're going to talk.
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:23.860]   Messaging is a new platform.
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:28.060]   Bots-- Microsoft talked a lot about bots at Build This Week.
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:31.460]   Bots are the apps for the new platform.
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:36.300]   Instead of iOS or Android, it's a messaging platform.
[02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:37.980]   And in it, with every paradigm shift,
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:39.460]   we've always knew winners and losers.
[02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:41.500]   And we've seen that every time.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.660]   And so there will be new billionaires
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:45.900]   to be minted as a result of these new technologies
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:47.220]   that we don't even know about yet.
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:48.780]   Huge stuff's coming along.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:51.980]   So VR, AR, messaging.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:54.420]   I think if you look at the Amazon Echo,
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:57.100]   that in a way is a messaging platform, too, isn't it?
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:00.860]   Instead of typing, it's a voice, but it's interactive.
[02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:03.780]   Autonomous vehicles, that's going to be a new platform.
[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:05.500]   We are not done yet.
[02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:07.500]   And that's good news for all of us.
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:08.620]   Right.
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:09.620]   Larry Maggot is here.
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:12.140]   He's from CBS Radio News.
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:14.340]   And of course, his own site, Larry's World,
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:16.500]   and always a pleasure to talk to Larry.
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:18.020]   One of the grand old men now.
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:19.020]   You can say it.
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:21.020]   Oh!
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:22.420]   Technology reporting.
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:26.300]   Alexa, tell Leo to stop playing it.
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:27.780]   Larry embraces it.
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:28.380]   Embrace it.
[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:29.460]   What are we going to do, right?
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:29.980]   Hold it.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:31.340]   Hold it.
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:32.460]   That's Dwight Silverman.
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:33.260]   Same thing.
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.100]   Great tech blogger.
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:34.540]   I'm all thinking it.
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.300]   From the Houston Chronicle.
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:39.780]   Hey, if you've made it this far, after a few decades
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:41.740]   in the business, that's a good thing, right?
[02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:42.540]   That's right.
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:43.180]   That's right.
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.340]   It's better than the alternative.
[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:48.780]   Just think of all the wisdom you've forgotten.
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:49.860]   But I forgot.
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:53.620]   Also, one of the younger young Turks up and coming,
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:56.660]   Tim Stevens, well, I can't even say that about you now.
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:59.540]   No, I'm approaching Middle-Age at this one or something
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:03:59.820]   like that.
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:00.860]   The roadshow.com.
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:01.380]   He's now at--
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:02.780]   A note right here.
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:04.820]   One of the editor-in-chief, long-time editor-chief
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:07.140]   at Engadget and also a great friend.
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:08.420]   It's great to have all three of you.
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:10.460]   I showed you they brought to you by Wealthfront.
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:15.340]   As you do contemplate nature's long corridor towards the end,
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:19.660]   you might start thinking about saving for your retirement,
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:21.020]   for that house you want to buy.
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.940]   Get that down payment together, the kids college.
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:26.140]   Yeah, I have some friends who are just having babies.
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:28.580]   And I tell them, they're going to be in college
[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:30.220]   before you know it.
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:31.540]   Start saving now.
[02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:33.020]   But how do you save?
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:34.900]   You put it all in a savings account.
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:36.780]   You might as well put it in a mattress.
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:38.780]   You put it-- well, you must invest, right?
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:40.940]   Oh, but are you going to manage the investment?
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:43.780]   Are you prepared to constantly pay attention
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:45.900]   to what's going on and re-balance and reinvest
[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:48.060]   and think about it and learn and study?
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:50.420]   That's fun for about a month.
[02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:52.140]   Oh, you're going to hire an investment advisor.
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:53.420]   You know what they charge you?
[02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:56.860]   Like 1% to 3% of what you have under investment every year.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.260]   That means your returns that have to be 3% better every year
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:01.660]   just to break even.
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.860]   That's not a good way.
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:06.980]   That's why we love and recommend Wealthfront.
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:11.780]   Wealthfront is computer-based automated long-term investment.
[02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:13.580]   We're not talking day trading here.
[02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:18.780]   They have built into the software state-of-the-art investment
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:21.180]   knowledge from some of the best investment people
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:23.700]   in the world-- people like Burton Malkiel and Charles
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:29.180]   D. Ellis 200 years of investment prowess.
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:31.940]   Wealthfront portfolios are based on something called modern
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:32.980]   portfolio theory.
[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:34.460]   Go to wealthrent.com/twit.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:35.740]   You can read about this.
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:37.700]   They're designed to adjust according
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:39.700]   to your own personal risk tolerance.
[02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:42.820]   So they're absolutely customized for you.
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:45.940]   But they stay diversified and, most importantly,
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:48.900]   for you, tax-efficient.
[02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:50.340]   Wealthfront is transparent.
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:51.180]   It's accessible.
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:53.020]   You can see all your accounts in one place,
[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:55.300]   whether they're personal, joint, or retirement.
[02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:57.260]   You can see every trade Wealthfront
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:59.300]   makes on your behalf right there on your desktop
[02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:01.380]   or your mobile app.
[02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:03.140]   And unlike other financial advisors,
[02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:04.540]   Wealthfront's not going to bog you down
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:05.580]   with a bunch of questions.
[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:09.060]   They have really simplified the process, just a few questions,
[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:10.620]   and you'll be investing sooner.
[02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:14.540]   For as little as $500, that's the minimum investment.
[02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:16.700]   It's estimated that more than 90% of portfolios
[02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:19.020]   are not invested properly for the long-term.
[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:20.340]   Wealthfront has a new feature.
[02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:21.100]   This is free.
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:24.140]   You could try it right now at wealthfront.com/twit.
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:26.020]   It's called their portfolio review.
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:27.940]   It'll see if your portfolio is at risk
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:30.700]   how diversified your investments are,
[02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:33.460]   what you're losing to fees, even minimize taxes,
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:35.380]   and that is free.
[02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:37.580]   You'll also get their recommended portfolio
[02:06:37.580 --> 02:06:39.700]   based on your risk profile.
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:43.380]   It's an amazing thing.
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:45.900]   And all of this, not 1%, 2%, 3%,
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:49.340]   one quarter of 1% a year.
[02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:51.820]   With never any commissions or hidden fees,
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:53.940]   it's very affordable.
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:55.420]   In fact, we're going to make it even more so
[02:06:55.420 --> 02:06:59.220]   because your first $15,000 when you invest at wealthfront.com/twit
[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:02.380]   is free of charge forever, not a quarter of 1%,
[02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:04.780]   but nothing forever.
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:07.100]   So that's the way to start the nest egg.
[02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:09.620]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:11.740]   I want you to read about it.
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:15.020]   Never would want you to invest sight unseen.
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:17.700]   But they've just added artificial intelligence features
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:20.140]   to this so that they are improving their algorithm along.
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:21.300]   If you look at their performance,
[02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:23.060]   even in these tough times, you'll see
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:25.420]   this is the way to do it.
[02:07:25.420 --> 02:07:29.540]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:31.460]   We've heard from so many of you now
[02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:33.060]   who have taken advantage of that offer
[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:35.260]   and who are having such great results.
[02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:39.220]   Let's see.
[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:44.060]   Did you see Facebook has a special studio in New York
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:48.540]   where they teach celebrities how to use Facebook?
[02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:50.380]   There's Martha Stewart.
[02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:52.660]   I thought at first this was her prison photo.
[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:55.140]   She doesn't.
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:57.020]   She looks so unhappy.
[02:07:57.020 --> 02:07:59.260]   Hard to believe that Martha doesn't know how to use Facebook.
[02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:01.820]   She's actually much more tech savvy than you might imagine.
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:03.420]   (laughs)
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:05.100]   But it's kind of weird.
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:06.900]   Yeah.
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:08.460]   Well, they're going so much into video.
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:09.980]   I think that has a lot to do.
[02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:11.540]   They really want.
[02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:12.460]   They really want.
[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:15.260]   Remember they gave verified profiles,
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:17.980]   early access to this app's Facebook mentions
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:19.100]   that allowed you to stream video.
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:21.380]   Now they've opened it to everybody.
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:25.100]   All they got was Ricky Gervais petting his cat.
[02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:27.460]   And Robert Scobull doing everything.
[02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:28.300]   Yeah.
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:29.580]   I don't think it was a hit.
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:30.420]   Scobull.
[02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:32.700]   But we're using it here.
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:34.180]   We're using it here.
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:35.540]   Yeah, we have a lot of,
[02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:37.940]   several of our sports people are baseball writers.
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:40.180]   We're using it during spring training
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:42.740]   to broadcast from the spring training games.
[02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:44.740]   And we're looking for ways to do it here
[02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:45.780]   because it's great.
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:48.580]   One of the things you can do is you can set it up.
[02:08:48.580 --> 02:08:51.060]   A reporter can use it on his Facebook page.
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:53.140]   And then while they're doing that live feed,
[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:55.900]   we can share that over to our main,
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:57.740]   used to Chronicle Facebook page
[02:08:57.740 --> 02:09:00.260]   and have it right there for people to see.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:02.020]   Live videos got no future.
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:03.140]   That's crazy talk.
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:05.780]   Who would be interested in watching live streams for hours?
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:06.620]   Oh, nevermind.
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:07.700]   (laughs)
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:08.540]   I've seen it.
[02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:10.100]   I've seen it every reporter now
[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:12.340]   has to be a photographer in a television television.
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:13.180]   That's right.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:14.780]   They call it a predator, right?
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.820]   Producer, editor, host.
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:17.660]   It's exhausting.
[02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:18.500]   Yeah.
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:19.860]   It is exhausting, but that's,
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:20.700]   this is the future.
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:22.380]   On the other hand, if you're a master of it,
[02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:23.380]   look at Donald Trump.
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:24.980]   (laughs)
[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:25.820]   I'm being serious.
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:27.740]   I'm not gonna get political here on you,
[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:32.500]   but the candidates who will succeed in politics
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:35.380]   going forward are people who can master social media
[02:09:35.380 --> 02:09:36.780]   and mass media.
[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:38.820]   Trump's done both equally well.
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:42.340]   But I think it really started with Trump's Twitter feed,
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:45.180]   which for years has been hysterical.
[02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:47.380]   'Cause it's just be crazy, right?
[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:48.220]   But yeah.
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:49.580]   Who knew that was the path for the presidency?
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:51.060]   (laughs)
[02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:52.780]   Yeah, it's almost horrifying,
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:54.420]   but I don't see him shooting his own video.
[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:57.140]   So we got, that's something on him there at least.
[02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:57.980]   (laughs)
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:09:58.820]   Yeah.
[02:09:58.820 --> 02:09:59.740]   And I think that was something that we mentioned early
[02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:00.660]   about the Model 3 event,
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:01.820]   why that was a bit of a challenge.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:03.500]   We weren't allowed to bring photographers,
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:05.620]   or we weren't allowed to bring videographers.
[02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:07.620]   We weren't even allowed to bring proper cameras in,
[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:09.700]   so we were shooting everything on us on phones.
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:12.220]   I did, I did sneak in a proper camera
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:13.300]   to get some pictures later,
[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.940]   but for the actual drive, we could only use our phone.
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:17.380]   So here I am sitting in the car,
[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:20.300]   trying to enjoy the experience, take everything in,
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:22.540]   while also filming everything on my smartphone,
[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:24.620]   which isn't exactly a great experience.
[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:26.380]   But as part of the way it is,
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:27.940]   people wanna see things as it happens,
[02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:31.180]   and ultimately the excitement around that event,
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:32.940]   it was great to be able to bring people along
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:35.060]   with the experience, I think that's the beautiful thing
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:38.260]   about all these online tools we have these days.
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:43.020]   I feel like there are a lot of people, museums,
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:46.900]   Broadway shows, who haven't caught up with the future.
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:48.380]   The best thing anybody could do is
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:51.740]   to Instagram your thing, right?
[02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:53.300]   As long as they don't disrupt it
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:54.980]   with a flash or something,
[02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:59.900]   having people post an Instagram of the Mona Lisa
[02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:03.020]   is not gonna diminish the value of the Mona Lisa.
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:06.220]   - Remember that big price fight in Las Vegas
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:08.140]   and people were putting it on Periscope,
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:09.700]   and there was a bunch of--
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.180]   - USC, yeah. - You couldn't do it.
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:13.220]   - $100 to watch it on pay-per-view,
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:15.940]   and I don't know if you were a serious viewer of that
[02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:18.940]   but you're not gonna use Periscope and Stack.
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:19.780]   - Exactly.
[02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:20.940]   If you really care about the price,
[02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:23.180]   you're not gonna watch it on your own.
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:25.540]   - I think people, I don't think people understand
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:28.140]   the value of social media exposure.
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:29.820]   I'm always shocked when I go in a museum
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:31.820]   and they say no pictures.
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:33.140]   - Like when I'm gonna take a picture,
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:34.620]   print it, and hang it on my wall?
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:38.020]   What exactly are you trying to sell, right?
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:40.540]   - No flash, it's sometimes important.
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:42.020]   - That, no, I understand.
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:43.980]   And if you're in a movie or a Broadway show,
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:46.980]   you don't want a lot of camera pics,
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:49.420]   creams up there, you know, as people take pictures.
[02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:51.620]   You know, we saw Hamilton last week
[02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:55.420]   and I would be offended if people had pictures of it,
[02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:57.340]   but it was so hard for me.
[02:11:57.340 --> 02:12:00.820]   I took a picture as I do usually before the show started,
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:04.660]   but I would have loved just one little picture.
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:06.060]   Would have been so great.
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:09.060]   Hamilton, though, which is the biggest hit on Broadway
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:11.180]   right now, has absolutely used social media
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:13.780]   to a tea per with, to perfection.
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:16.140]   And I think they're quite smart not to allow
[02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:18.180]   cameras, not because they don't want pictures,
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:19.620]   but because they don't want the,
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:21.620]   but if you, yeah, the disruption,
[02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:25.380]   if you follow Lin Miranda, Lin Manuel Miranda's Twitter feed
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:28.060]   every day, a picture of another celebrity backstage
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:30.260]   with him at the show, I mean, he really, they're very smart.
[02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:31.340]   - Well, remember the Grateful Dead,
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:33.140]   they were the first band to allow people
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:35.700]   to record their concerts and it turned out
[02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:37.380]   to be part of the reason for their success,
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:39.420]   was that they allowed bootleg tapes
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:41.460]   as opposed to fighting it and their fans loved them.
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:43.620]   - And lasting success, right?
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:44.460]   - Absolutely.
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:47.100]   - They're still beloved today because you can listen to tapes.
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:48.780]   So yeah, that's a perfect example.
[02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:50.540]   - And once fans caught some of the audio
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:51.900]   that the professionals didn't catch,
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:54.340]   so they were able to recover some of the concerts
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:56.620]   that otherwise would have never been memorialized.
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:12:57.940]   - Yep.
[02:12:57.940 --> 02:12:59.740]   That's a lesson that's funny,
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:01.380]   people are slow to learn, I guess.
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:07.020]   Let's see, there's a lot of little stuff
[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:11.780]   you're shaking down to the bottom of the news tree.
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:16.060]   How about this one, let's wrap up with this one.
[02:13:16.060 --> 02:13:19.620]   This is a technology I can get, I can really get behind.
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:22.100]   This is from The Mirror, so I don't know if I trust it.
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:23.420]   (laughing)
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:27.300]   A man has built a Scarlett Johansson robot
[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:31.540]   to fulfill his childhood dream
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:35.500]   and according to The Mirror, it's terrifyingly realistic.
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:39.020]   Now, after hearing her, the movie with Scarlett Johansson
[02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:40.020]   as the voice,
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:44.900]   I do wish I had a Scarlett Johansson operating system.
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:49.020]   This guy is just a creep.
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:53.860]   I never thought anyone could ruin Scarlett Johansson for me.
[02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:56.180]   - That is just, but this guy is a group Scarlett Johansson.
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:58.260]   - How do you think Scarlett Johansson feels?
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:13:59.180]   - Oh man.
[02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:00.020]   - Creeped.
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:00.860]   - Yeah.
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:02.940]   - And who thinks that's purely realistic?
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:04.100]   You have a pretty low standard.
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:04.940]   - Look at her hands!
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:06.780]   - Oh, here's a hair, a sculpture.
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:10.700]   - Does she have any rights when it comes to her image being used?
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:11.660]   - Does it look like her?
[02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:13.580]   I think she would lose in court.
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:14.580]   - Yeah, for that one.
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:16.980]   - That's pretty true.
[02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:21.780]   - He has spent $50,000 on this.
[02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:24.420]   Starting as you can see from the skeleton.
[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:25.620]   - Wow.
[02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:27.020]   - Working his way up.
[02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:27.860]   I mean, I--
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:29.380]   - And it's 3D printed parts,
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:31.220]   so he's done a lot of this on the 3D printer.
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:32.860]   - I mean, I admire his initiative.
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:34.420]   (laughing)
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:36.300]   - If it's not an April Fool joke, you're sure about that.
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:37.620]   - Oh, maybe it is.
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:38.460]   - Yeah.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:42.340]   - You know, I might have gotten bit.
[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:43.540]   (laughing)
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:45.500]   He said, "When I was a child, I liked robots.
[02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:47.100]   Why? Because I liked watching animation.
[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:47.940]   All children loved it.
[02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:49.820]   They were transformers after I grew up.
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:51.420]   I wanted to make one during this process.
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:52.420]   A lot of people would say things like,
[02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:53.940]   "Are you stupid?
[02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:54.940]   This takes a lot of money.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:55.980]   Do you even know how to do it?
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:58.780]   It's really hard, but now, oh now."
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:01.220]   Actually, that does kind of look like
[02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:02.460]   Scarlett Johansson right there.
[02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:03.980]   That one kind of looks like her.
[02:15:03.980 --> 02:15:06.140]   - Toshi moves.
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:07.460]   - Yeah, Toshi moves.
[02:15:07.460 --> 02:15:08.300]   - Yeah.
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:10.540]   (laughing)
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:13.540]   - Can they have the problem in Jaws?
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:15.780]   (laughing)
[02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:19.620]   - Ladies and gentlemen, this is a fitting place
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.020]   to end this conversation.
[02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:25.340]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:28.860]   Tim Stevens loved your reporting from the Model 3 event.
[02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:31.780]   Congratulations to your wife on her car
[02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:33.900]   that she'll be getting in a few years.
[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:34.740]   - Few to five years.
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:36.100]   - Few to five years.
[02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:37.660]   - Oh, we didn't mention bash in Windows.
[02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:38.900]   I knew I forgot something.
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:40.460]   I teased that and everything.
[02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:41.900]   Anything to say about that?
[02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:45.900]   - As a Sigmund user, I don't see the big deal.
[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:46.740]   - Oh, you know what?
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:47.860]   This is gonna be so much better than Sigmund.
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:50.260]   In fact, one of the reasons I use a Macintosh
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:53.100]   and use Linux is I want a real command line
[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:54.260]   with real power.
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.500]   Power Shell, not quite it.
[02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:58.540]   I use Sigmund and Putty, right?
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:01.820]   But they're ported versions of these apps.
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:03.700]   What they've done, what's Microsoft done
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:04.940]   is kind of remarkable with Ubuntu.
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:09.820]   They're actually gonna get the actual Ubuntu ELF binaries.
[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:11.140]   I presume you could compile your own
[02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:12.740]   'cause I presume you're gonna get GCC
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:15.500]   and all the tools that come on the Unix platform.
[02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:16.340]   This is great.
[02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:18.380]   This makes me actually consider Windows 10.
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:20.780]   It's not Linux.
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:21.700]   Don't get confused.
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:25.540]   It's more like wine for my reverse wine.
[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:28.100]   So wine, which lets you run Windows programs on Linux
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:30.380]   by emulating Linux calls,
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:32.900]   translating Windows calls into Linux calls.
[02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:33.940]   This is doing the opposite.
[02:16:33.940 --> 02:16:37.980]   It's translating the calls from the Linux apps
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:40.100]   into commands that Windows can restore.
[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:42.940]   - So we're gonna have Ubuntu.dll.
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:44.740]   - Oh my God, I bet there is.
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:47.020]   Come to think of it.
[02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:48.180]   Yeah, I bet there is.
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:52.020]   But I have to say this is gonna be something
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:54.580]   that will make me be much more likely to use Windows.
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:58.020]   Somebody said, "That's the April Fool's joke."
[02:16:58.020 --> 02:17:01.340]   No, it's serious.
[02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:02.580]   Anyway, thank you, Tim.
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:04.380]   Really appreciate it.
[02:17:04.380 --> 02:17:06.060]   Theroadshow.com.
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:07.100]   - Right, thank you.
[02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:08.980]   - To follow Tim's coverage, automotive coverage.
[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:10.940]   What's the next big automotive event?
[02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:13.020]   - We've got a little bit of a break.
[02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:14.980]   I think Paris is the next big automotive show,
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:16.580]   but we've got a lot of great stuff coming up on the site.
[02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:19.220]   We just did a shootout between the Audi S7
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:21.140]   and the Tesla Model S as a matter of fact.
[02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:22.820]   So we'll show the winner may surprise you.
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:23.820]   So that's on the site right now.
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:25.620]   - No kidding, I'd be very interested.
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:28.820]   I have an Audi A8, which I really love.
[02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:30.340]   Lisa has an S5.
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:32.820]   But that's the A8's.
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:37.340]   The car I'll be trading in for a Model X.
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:38.340]   - Yeah, it's a great car.
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:39.180]   - Some day.
[02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:40.500]   - Some day.

[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:20.860]   (laughing)
[02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:22.380]   Larry, you need to come back to Houston
[02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:23.860]   so we can have some more barbecue.
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:24.700]   That was great.
[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:25.540]   - Oh.
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:26.380]   - That was barbecue in Houston.
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:27.220]   - Ooh, that's right.
[02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:28.060]   - Oh, that's right.
[02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:29.540]   - Now I'm by Tesla all the way to Houston.
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:30.540]   There you go.
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:31.620]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:32.700]   - That would be a challenge.
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:35.180]   See if you can find superchargers along the way.
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:36.180]   - Oh, I'm sure you can.
[02:18:36.180 --> 02:18:37.220]   - Sure you can.
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:38.300]   - Yeah, it's Interstate 10.
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:39.620]   They've got them all along in the state.

[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:44.060]   That's a long way to go.
[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:45.980]   - True.
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:46.820]   - But it's worth it.
[02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:47.820]   - Absolutely.
