[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Starting with John.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   John, pre-chued Devorak.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Hello, Johnny.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Hey there, everybody.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Hey, welcome, Jay. It's number one. He's got a big fat foam finger.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   That's a... you know, I thought they were bigger than that.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   No, this is about it. This is a classic.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   This is a small foam finger.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   This is a classic foam finger.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   A foam finger.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Oh, the foam finger classic.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Yes.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   As opposed to the form figure two.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   We do have a World Series game game four this afternoon in about an hour and a half.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So let's get the hell out of here.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Let's get this show on the road.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Hey, I'm so glad to welcome our next guest, Shannon Morse is here.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You remember her from hack five, of course.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Yes.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And snubs on Twitter.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yes.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Sonos.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   One B.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   SNUBS.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And our newest host on the Twit Network she's going to be on before you buy.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I'm glad to have you.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I am so happy to be here.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   We really feel fortunate to have you.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Really?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   So one of the things we like to do with new hosts is get them on Twit so they can be introduced
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   to the grownup body.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yeah, just throw me in the D.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Great to have you, Shannon.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Thanks.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   She's doing a new show on security on this new revision three discovery YouTube channel.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Yeah, just released.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's called a youtube.com/techfeed.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   T-E-C-H-F-E-D.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.720]   And we'll be doing a new show just about consumer security and how to keep yourself safe and
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.440]   how to understand what's going on on the internet.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.080]   With that hacker Darren Kitchen.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   Yeah, that one hacker.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.640]   He's a hacker.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   That guy's a hacker.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   YouTube.com/techfeed.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.400]   I shouldn't be promoting it because...
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.680]   It's on a different network.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.120]   Direct competition.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120]   You got Veronica.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   They've got...
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.960]   Texila's on here I presume.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   Hack five is on here.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   Hack campaign season is on here.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.320]   The Gauss, I don't know who she is.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   I don't think it's direct competition, but it is.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.560]   All right, it's direct competition.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.680]   And also with us, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately not in person by a Skype, Mr. Robert Scobel.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.440]   Scobelizer, my old friend with a nice blue mic.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.800]   I like your blue mic.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   I love it.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   That's a nice mic.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   It lets me sound...
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   Like Bob Dylan.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.240]   That's what Bob Dylan uses to get those rich tones.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   How was it?
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   Baby bottle mic.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.160]   So, Callee, I don't know where to start today.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.640]   There is so much that went on and there is so much next week as well.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   Oh, look.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.440]   The blue mic's taking a tour of the world.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.680]   It's really called blue.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.640]   Ah, that's how he gets it free.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   Okay.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.800]   This is the ad portion of Robert's read.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   Just keep doing that.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   That's all right.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.200]   No, I gave him a free plug.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.760]   They also make the Yeti, which a lot of podcasters use.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.480]   It's a nice USB mic.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   I have one of those two.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.480]   I bought that one.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.480]   Not that one.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   Not the one you're using.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480]   I had one of those.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   He sent me this for a free plug.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   All right.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.480]   What was I saying?
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   Oh, what a week.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   Lots of stuff.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   Watch this stuff.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.240]   Apple on Tuesday has its big announcement.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.520]   We thought it was just going to be the iPad mini, which by the way, I did not think they
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.520]   were going to...
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   Were you surprised, Shannon?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.520]   They call it the mini?
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   No.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   Not really.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.520]   Doesn't it like lend...
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   Like this is the iPad maxi then?
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.320]   I mean, what else are they going to call it?
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   The mini pad?
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   iPad half?
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   Yes, you're right.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.360]   And they own the mini trademark because they make the Mac mini, and they're capitalizing
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.840]   it the same way with the lowercase.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.000]   Is that a mini you got, Robert?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   No.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   No, this is my Nexus 7.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   What are they going to call it?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.520]   An iPad 8-inch or something?
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.480]   It's 7.9 inches.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.360]   Very much what we thought it was going to be.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.880]   They did announce a new faster processor.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.480]   Actually, the bigger shock was that they so quickly tossed the iPad third generation.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.520]   The new iPad is now the no longer iPad and the new iPad is now...
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.880]   It's very confusing.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.600]   The fourth generation iPad is the 6X processor much faster.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.560]   And there were some people upset.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.560]   What does all that speed do for you on the iPad?
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   Well, because, you know what, I think it's true that they needed it because it's a retin
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.960]   display and pushing all those pixels, the iPad 3 was a little slower than the iPad 2,
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.960]   right?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.280]   So I think they did need...
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.440]   And when the iPhone 5 came out, it had a much faster processor, and they needed to
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.200]   add the speed, I think, to keep up with those pixels.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.360]   That, having been said, there were people upset, irate, that Apple would dare to release
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.800]   a new iPad only seven months into the 10-year-old iPad.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.440]   Heaven forbid.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   You disagree?
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   Well, seven months.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.640]   I mean, they should be turning these upgrades up every 6.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.240]   I think there was laggards.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.040]   There's laggards.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.880]   What's the alternative, Leo, is to go with Android where there's a new device every three
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   weeks?
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.880]   I mean, come on.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880]   I think here's what I think here's...
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   No, I agree.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.520]   In fact, I was upset and Sarah talked me down on our iPad today.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   She'll talk to you down.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   Well, you're on the ledge.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   You're using the job?
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   I was upset.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.320]   Well, you know why?
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.920]   Because we had a contest where we gave away iPads and we had to give away the old iPad
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.640]   because the new one...
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.640]   It was embarrassing.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   Oh, you were here.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   I might be doing that today.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.640]   Am I giving away a...
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   No, I'm not.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.640]   An old iPad?
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.440]   Anybody want an old iPad?
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.000]   Everybody raise their hands in the audience.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.800]   They'll take it.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.480]   So that's the point is it isn't that much...
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.760]   I mean, there's not that much difference.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.840]   It's faster, but there's not that much difference.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.360]   However, I understand the upset, which is that Apple kind of made a promise.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   There is a tacit.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.040]   It's not explicit, but a tacit promise.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.560]   We will do a new iPhone every year and a new iPad every year and not more, right?
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.560]   So they broke their promise.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.200]   This is just global doing.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.680]   That's the lightning connector.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.680]   Fascinating.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.320]   Not looking forward to that adapter.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   That's the difference.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.440]   So you can go buy $20 of cords.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.280]   Actually, I bought $60 of these little cords.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280]   $200.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.320]   I had to buy the connectors, the adapters, the cords, because I didn't want to have them
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.360]   all.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   But you know what?
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.240]   This is such a first world problem.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.040]   Well, it is a first nerd problem, but it's also a temporary problem.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.240]   And you know, we'll be saturated.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.400]   Just we're saturated now with 30 pin cables.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.720]   We'll be saturated with lightning cables in a year or more.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.080]   I have four of them already, so that's $80 worth of cables.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.440]   They'll be everywhere you go.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   Yeah, they will.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.680]   They had to make that change, though.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.200]   I mean, the 30 pin connectors, 10 years old is...
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   Yeah, they did.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.440]   I mean, didn't they say it's a little bit faster and it changes a few things in the adapter
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.440]   itself?
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.200]   That's actually the disappointment is not faster.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.160]   We thought it might be faster.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160]   It's USB 2.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.280]   It's the same speed.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   But they did change the pins.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   It's not USB 3.0.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.280]   No.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.280]   That's not available.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   Is that true?
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   It's USB 2.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   It is available.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280]   Not available in an iPhone or an iPad.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.360]   It's available on the PC because they're using an IV bridge processor, a system on a
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   chip that has support for an iPad 3.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   They don't have that?
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   No, they find it.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   They don't have that.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   It's too lame.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   It's too lame.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   It's disappointing.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   But it could support it.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.120]   You know, the advantage of this over the micro USB is if you get home and you're drunk
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.120]   and it's dark...
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.840]   It could go in wrong.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.280]   You can stick this in either way.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.640]   You can go that way or...
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   Stick it in where?
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   Either way in the hole.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.080]   It's a lot easier to figure out.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.240]   No, I like that.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.760]   And also micro USB is, besides being one way only, it's kind of funky, right?
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.000]   You feel like you're going to bend the connector.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It's kind of...
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.200]   Even if you put it in right, it's so small.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.160]   So this is nicer in that respect.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.640]   But I still wish it weren't proprietary.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   I have lots of micro USB.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.360]   I really wish they just changed it to micro USB because I have so many devices and connectors
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   that are ready.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   Look at that.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   It's insane.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.160]   There's a reason though, and we talked about it a little bit on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.200]   I mean, there's technical reasons why they needed something that wasn't micro USB.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.800]   They could only do what they want to do with an iPad connector.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.600]   No, they could only control the ecosystem with their own proprietary chip and the cord
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.920]   so that they could control the licensing.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.120]   There's micro USB right there.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.480]   So let's go one by one.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.400]   First of all, the iPad mini.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.440]   It's an F gadget, by the way.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   What is that?
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.440]   Stop it.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.240]   It's like one cable, one plug.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.880]   With every possible USB.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.520]   Except you know what's not on there?
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.680]   A lightning connector.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.840]   The lightning connector, yeah.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.600]   The one thing you want is not on there because Apple owns it and won't license it.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.280]   So let's start with the mini.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280]   $329.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.840]   Too much, too little, too late.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.440]   We already said it was too much.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   It's a good price.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   It was too much.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   Yeah, way too much.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   What should it have been?
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   I'll buy it for Christmas.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   You want it should have been?
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   What?
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   $179.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.920]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.400]   Let's go over the theory.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.800]   The reason is because they have, right now they're inviting competition.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.320]   They should pull one of the old Silicon Valley bits where they would just kind of lure competition
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.160]   in and then submarine them and just wipe them off the face of the earth.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.800]   And they're not going to be able to do that at these prices.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.720]   All they're doing is inviting more competition.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.680]   This is not a good strategy.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.480]   The stock market already punished them for lowered margins.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.040]   No, the stock market punished them for overpricing this product.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.600]   When they came out, you could watch the ticker.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.200]   When they said $329, the stock started going down.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.840]   Not because their margins had dropped?
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.840]   No.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.400]   And they gave a prediction that next quarter would be worse?
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   No, we were talking about at the moment.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   It was the price.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   At the moment.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   It was the price.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.440]   They said that price and the Horowitz watches these things.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.960]   And he watches the tickers.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.040]   And he's saying when they say one thing and it goes down and he makes an oath, they say
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.760]   something else that goes up and that that is what happened.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.160]   Shannon, you thought it was a good price.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   I think it's a good price.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160]   Why?
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.560]   Because everybody knows that Apple is a premium brand and people are willing to pay a little
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.960]   bit more money to get that.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.200]   And it isn't that much more.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.000]   It's $70 more than the comparable Nexus 7.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.760]   Yeah, it's the whole $70.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   70 bucks.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   Look at that.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.760]   You get a camera.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   If I just throw your money away.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.560]   But you get more, you get a camera.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.800]   You get a compressed economy.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.840]   But it's under that 500 bucks that a lot of people cut off at.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.320]   I know a lot of people cut off at $200 as well.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.320]   $199.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.160]   $199 would have been a great price point.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.880]   I think $299 might have been better than $320.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.880]   $329 is weird.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.880]   It's like, what's the $29?
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.880]   Why not $299?
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.680]   It's like one of those kindles I bought for like $129.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   It's right.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.920]   For example, if Apple protecting its margins and Apple's been like that for a long time
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.440]   that they care more about margins than anything else.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.960]   I think it's going to, I think John's right.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.560]   I think over the next 18 months, we're going to see a real shift in the marketplace where
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.920]   Apple is going to be, is not the innovator and not the, not the bleeding edge leader.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.600]   And that's really dangerous for Apple.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.920]   Pointing, case in point.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   Of course he's holding it by Galaxy Note 2, which is $300 added to your contract.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.080]   I mean, I'm like $29 more.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.080]   You can iPad mini.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.720]   Now, of course, Apple's not hurting.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.280]   They make a call on one of those.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.720]   How many billions of dollars they have in the bank?
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.760]   They have $115 billion and sales are still going up.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.800]   It's a shame Apple's doing so poorly with their overpriced products.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.640]   I'm just telling you, they're inviting a long-term disaster.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   This is not a good thing.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.440]   It's not a disaster, but they're going to end up.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.000]   Give it two years.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Okay.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.560]   You know, I'm writing a book about these Google Glasses, Project Glass, and I'm really shifting
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.200]   my mentality around those.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.800]   I finally got a chance to play with them and they're pretty damn impressive.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.560]   You actually, because you're writing a book.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   Are you NDA?
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   Are they actually work?
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560]   Yes, they do.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   And they're very impressive.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   Yes, I'm NDA.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.720]   They asked us not to talk about what's going on.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.560]   How can you do a book?
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.560]   Because the book comes out later.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.640]   It comes out next year when you get to buy them.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.440]   If you never written a book, don't you understand how this works?
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.480]   Does the NDA, when you finish the book, when you finish the book next week, you have to
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.480]   just sit on the book?
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   Yes.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.840]   Besides, who's going to buy a book until you can't buy for nine months?
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   And what they showed you this time.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   When did they come out?
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   Can you say that?
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.800]   No, developers have shown this thing.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   How could it be a secret?
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.680]   Nobody got to wear it except for Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor who had no idea what
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.080]   to do with it.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.160]   Even the people who have gotten to wear them have not gotten to see what they actually
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   do.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.080]   They get to take a picture, take a video and play back the picture in the video.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.560]   They don't see what the actual UI lets you do.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.360]   But you, Robert Gazilovich Scobel, you have played with it.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.840]   And so what can I do?
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   I can't tell you.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   I'll just say one thing.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.840]   Give us a hint.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   That's such a genius.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.920]   Nobody Google watches this show.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.920]   You can tell us.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.680]   Just say one little thing that they won't get upset about.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.360]   Here's what to think about.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.560]   If you try to hold a laser with your hand on a dot across the room, it's very hard to
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.560]   hold that dot.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.680]   If you put that same laser on your glasses and try to hold that dot, you can hold it
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.680]   for hours.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.840]   And that's how the UI works.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.800]   You can just do little tiny microshifts with your head to go through the UI.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.000]   And it'll think about what you would do with glasses.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.520]   If I'm skiing, I want to see a heart rate.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.280]   Is it a heads up?
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   Is it a heads up display?
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.560]   I mean, let's get this straight.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.000]   It's like having your--
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Hold on, Scobel.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.680]   It's like coming to Nexus 7 glued to your head right here.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.120]   That's sort of what it looks like.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.120]   Scobel.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   It just happens to be skiing.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.720]   If you're skiing, you're going to-- you're trying to avoid trees.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.480]   You're going down and break neck speeds.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.280]   You want to know your heart rate, really?
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.400]   No, I want to know where my friends are.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.000]   I want to know where the next run is.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.120]   And I want to know the feet per second that I'm descending.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.800]   And I want to know a little bit about the mountain.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.000]   Tell me if my friends want to meet me for a beer and 10 minutes.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.120]   I've wondered looking at this.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.280]   How does this work?
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.800]   Is it a heads up display?
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.120]   Or do you look over and look at a screen?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.920]   It's not in your front.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.880]   It's over here.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.560]   So you look to the left, and you see a screen,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.400]   and then you look forward.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.000]   And then you hit the tree.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.720]   So that's interesting.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.760]   So it's not a heads up display.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.720]   It's not projected on what you're looking at.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.040]   It's over on the left side.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.920]   Not the one I've seen.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.400]   What about your peripheral vision, though?
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.640]   I mean, now are you going to walk into things to the left?
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.440]   No, I don't think so.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:53.920]   Is it like texting?
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.520]   OK.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.880]   People always fall over when they're texting.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.320]   I have--
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.280]   That's dangerous than texting, because you're still looking ahead
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.960]   at where you're supposed to be going.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.800]   You're not looking down at a device and focusing on the device.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.720]   It's a little different.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.960]   Well, I have to admit, everybody I say walking around
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.640]   is looking-- everybody now.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.600]   Nobody's looking at each other.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.680]   You go to a restaurant.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.040]   It's 180 people looking at this, looking like this,
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.480]   at their hand.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.320]   It's terrible.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.880]   It's a disgusting change in societal norms.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.120]   What's wrong with people?
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.600]   I'm telling you.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.680]   You see that at the theater, too.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.040]   What's that?
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.080]   I went to see a concert.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.000]   And in fact, I have pictures of the concert.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.640]   All you see is phones, because people aren't
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   enjoying the concert.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.760]   They're recording it for posterity or something.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.720]   I've got to let-- let's show you what I'm watching.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.160]   I'm watching Twitter in real time while I'm talking on the show.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   What are you, bored?
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.240]   Aren't we getting enough attention?
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.800]   No, I'm just--
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.440]   Look at Amazon's front page.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.480]   Much more for much less.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.400]   They compare the Kindle Fire HD to the iPad Mini.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.880]   $199, 216 pixels per inch compared to 163.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.640]   You can watch HD movies and TV, not on the Mini.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.600]   Dual stereo speakers, which, by the way, sound like crap,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.200]   mono speaker on the iPad Mini.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.360]   Ultra-fast, vinyl, white.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.400]   You just got to slam the company?
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.720]   Is that all you're going to do today?
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.560]   Slam which company?
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.400]   Apple.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.840]   No, I'm slamming the Kindle Fire.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.440]   It says it has terrible speakers.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.760]   Have you heard the Fire HD?
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.260]   No.
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.000]   Yeah, there's two of them.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.360]   But they're--
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.400]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.120]   Left and right.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.200]   Oh, that's disgusting.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.080]   It's double the crap.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.680]   Stunning HDs play 30% more pixels in the iPad Mini,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.200]   standard definition lower.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.680]   And look how much the price, $129 difference.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   That's a lot.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.320]   It's interesting, because Apple did the same thing,
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:39.640]   didn't they?
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.840]   They whipped out a leading Android tablet, which
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.960]   is obviously an X7.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.640]   And did the same kind of BS comparison, where they said,
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.720]   well, it has more pixel--
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.560]   they slanted the whole-- I mean, it's so slanted.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.920]   Never heard of such a thing.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.120]   I don't know.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.040]   What Apple should do is pull out all the weird long tail
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.160]   apps that are written for it and not for the Kindle Fire.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.320]   We have more fart apps than any platform made.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.400]   More enterprise apps.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.160]   I mean, I--
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:10.600]   Same thing.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   Talk.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.320]   Much too much.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.680]   But do they have an S Pen?
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.160]   The Galaxy Note 2 has 100% more S Pen's than the next--
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.040]   That's going to be lost.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.520]   No, because when you--
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.320]   oh, we did this last time.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   Yes, and what happened?
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.320]   Nothing.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.400]   So supposedly, when you walk away from it, it beeps at you.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.880]   Nothing happened.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.160]   No.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.200]   I was just trying to get to where I had to go out the door.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:32.960]   Yeah, I know, yeah.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.680]   Because it locks behind.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.200]   And while you're on Amazon, by the way,
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.400]   my son's first mystery book finally came out.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.240]   Oh, what's it called?
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.760]   It's called Hot Digity Dead.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.680]   That's a good name.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.760]   That's a very good name.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.560]   Did you help him with it?
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.200]   No, no, he came up with it.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.920]   Is Digity with 2Gs or 1?
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.400]   You just go to JS Devorek, you'll find it.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:50.840]   On Amazon.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.440]   Hot Digity Dead.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.600]   It's a Turnbull mystery.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.360]   It's the name of the detective.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.320]   So this is the first in a series.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.160]   Look at this.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   299 Kindle purchase.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.440]   299 Kindle everyone should buy it.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:00.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.760]   Don't have to keep paying.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.480]   I don't have to buy it.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.600]   I can get it free, because I'm a prime member.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.080]   What?
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.520]   Barrow for free on Kindle.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.800]   Oh, you get to borrow it.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.000]   That's no good.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.880]   He needs the money.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.040]   OK, this raises a good story.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.520]   The woman in Norway, whose Kindle--
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:16.760]   Oh, yes, a good story.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.120]   Her account was canceled.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.200]   She had a lot of books on her Kindle.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.720]   She was buying them in the UK.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.120]   Amazon said, your account is associated with another bad account.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.920]   We're going to discontinue your account.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.600]   Oh, by the way, you'll never be able to read your books again
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   on any device.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.000]   And don't try to make another account,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.680]   because we're watching you.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.520]   And bye-bye.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.560]   And she said, wait a minute.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.880]   What account am I associated with?
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.120]   They said, we can't tell you that.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.400]   Right.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.440]   No, it was all a bunch of canned bull crap.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:41.940]   Right.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.520]   They never gave her any satisfaction.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.040]   Well, she eventually did.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.960]   They actually eventually did.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.440]   But--
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.920]   Yeah, but they didn't tell her why.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.160]   They would not tell her why.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.920]   And the point I'm making is, according to the terms of service,
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.200]   she never did own those books.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.440]   She was borrowing them anyway.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.920]   You don't buy books at Amazon.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.880]   You lease them, right?
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.960]   Tell your messages, get them for free with your prime account.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   It's no different borrowing it for free from my Kindle.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.880]   It says from my Kindle.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.640]   Borrow for free from your Kindle.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.760]   What does that mean?
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.800]   Well, I guess I have to get my Kindle and borrow it for free.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.240]   I don't know.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.000]   I won't borrow it.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.280]   I will buy it.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.960]   That's what I like about you, Leo.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.640]   Big spender.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.200]   Big spender, 299.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.280]   It's all yours, JS to Vorac.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:24.920]   That's neat.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.800]   You must be proud.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:26.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.360]   Not yet that.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.320]   But it's scheme for doing all these different detectives
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.400]   and different story lines.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.600]   It's actually quite good.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.800]   He's amazing.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.480]   He actually could teach this type of writing
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.680]   at college level.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   He's read everything.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.160]   Did he read that book that you told me
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.000]   to get on making a living as a writer?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.800]   Yeah, of course.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.880]   In fact, he denied that.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.560]   The Woodford books.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.800]   He bought all of them.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.880]   That Woodford ever wrote.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.400]   That's neat.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.040]   And so he's got some crazy ones as Woodford was going nuts.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.760]   So it's Vorac publishing.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.840]   You got to be so proud.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.000]   This is so cool.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.120]   Murder, fraud, dog fighting, arcane architecture,
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.880]   weird characters, and a plot twist you won't believe.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.040]   Hey, can I read this book?
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.400]   Maybe do an audio version of the book for him?
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:07.840]   Sure.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.760]   I think you're a little--
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.240]   You could probably do it.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.560]   Sure, I'd have time to do it.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.720]   Play the part as the mystery, eh?
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.560]   I'm Roland Turdenbuh.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   The agent.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.640]   Oh, it's a dog mystery.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.600]   No, no, the guy--
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.040]   He's a show dog judge.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.520]   He's a show dog judge who uses his same skills
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.200]   to deter--
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:23.800]   I love that.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.520]   --so cry at.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:24.960]   I love that.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.800]   Yeah, that's very funny.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.600]   Good for JS.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.280]   That's so cool.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.640]   It's not really you, is it, John?
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.040]   No.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   OK.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.560]   I can't get the vinegar book finished.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.200]   I was supposed to be-- we were on a race
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   to see who finishes the book.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.960]   You won.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.400]   He won.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.120]   I think he did.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.200]   That's great.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.080]   He had this vinegar book done.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.040]   I am thrilled.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.920]   And he's self-publishing, basically, by using Amazon.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.800]   He's-- it's a Kindle--
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.280]   It probably goes through--
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.360]   How's that going?
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.480]   I'm looking at doing that for our book.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.640]   What was the problems of doing that?
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.640]   It actually pretty much nothing.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.040]   It was pretty home free, problem free.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.400]   The problem-- the only real problem he's having
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.640]   was it took him a couple of days to get the formatting down
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.200]   because you'd-- it looked like the right format.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.120]   And then when you pushed it to Kindle and you looked at it,
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.800]   it was like, why is this cut here?
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.600]   And you have to go back and tweak it.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.560]   Do you write it at word or what?
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.000]   No, he wrote it on one of the public domain word processors.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.000]   How's that book on Windows 95, John, that you're doing?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.440]   Is that--
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.000]   It's an example.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.120]   You know, the Windows 95-- I've discovered,
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.520]   they don't sell it anymore, so I had to can the project.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.440]   Oh, man, I hate it really knowing.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.160]   You know what you should do is just cross out the 95
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.360]   and write eight.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.920]   Actually, that would be funny.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.240]   Shan, are you a Mac user?
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.920]   I tell you.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.640]   No, somebody gave me this a few days ago.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.080]   Oh, is this your company computer?
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.920]   So you are Windows user.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.360]   I'm a Windows and Linux person.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.200]   And a Linux person.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.560]   And your phone is--
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.760]   My phone is an iPhone.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.320]   An iPhone?
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.240]   So I'm like all over the place.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.160]   So I'm really curious what you think about the Windows RT
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.560]   Surface.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.240]   We'll talk about that.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.320]   Apple actually announced new Macs, which is kind of a shock.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.080]   I didn't know they would do this, including one
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.880]   that I was sure was a fake.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.120]   I'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.960]   We're going to continue on with this week in tech.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.920]   Robert Scobel, the scobelizer, is here.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.280]   Rackspace.com.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.240]   What's that?
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.240]   Is that a special gesture that mean?
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.760]   That's the Geek Gang sign, man.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.600]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.080]   I'm not in this geek.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.680]   Hey, are you in the new Silicon Valley reality show?
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.240]   No.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.440]   Why not?
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   Because I'm not really enough.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.360]   You're not pretty enough.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.320]   That's probably why.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.640]   The hired actors from LA.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.880]   I'm not having enough sex.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.800]   I don't have any cocaine.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.600]   I know.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.160]   It's true.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:45.680]   I'm my desker.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.520]   It's truly like the real life.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.320]   I haven't shot anybody in the head.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.120]   I haven't done anything crazy, so--
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.120]   Yeah, the day's young.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.160]   Is that show on yet?
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.760]   Yeah, I think one of them ran.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.640]   I couldn't watch it.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.040]   I don't want to watch it, but I kind of want to see it.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.400]   You should.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.520]   I kind of do just because I live in this area.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.320]   But it's bogus.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:05.920]   It's not real.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.680]   It's totally bogus, and they shot it all down in LA mostly.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.040]   It's fake.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:11.480]   It's cable.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.040]   It's cable.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.840]   They have a reality show, of course, it's fake.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.120]   See what he did there with that?
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:20.560]   That's good.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.240]   They have a mansion here in San Francisco.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.360]   They filmed it in San Francisco.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:31.920]   But how many startups started a mansion with a good view?
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.440]   Actually, there is a mansion in the Pacific Heights,
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.480]   a startup mansion.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.360]   Don't you know about that?
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:36.880]   You've been there.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.040]   You must be there.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.960]   You know, Instagram started at a picnic table
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.520]   in a warehouse in San Francisco.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:51.560]   But those bamboo eye pad cases started in a mansion
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.280]   on Pacific Heights.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.800]   It's like somebody took over an old mansion,
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.720]   they divided it up, and they have lots of startups in there.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.080]   It's Silicon Valley's gang.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.680]   Aaron LeVee runs box, and I were talking about this yesterday
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.760]   that there's an Uber for private jets now with the--
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.160]   Don't say they're bad against them.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.320]   They want to advertise on Twitter.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.240]   God bless America.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.880]   You know what's going on?
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.320]   What's going on?
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.760]   I said, do I get flights?
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.560]   They said, yes.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   I said, you're on.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.040]   What's this?
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.240]   Let's hear about this.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.240]   They haven't bought ads yet.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:20.720]   Save it.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.240]   No.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.520]   No.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.000]   We got to go on some trips.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.760]   Exactly.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.600]   I know how to get a few.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   For seven in those jets.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.560]   Uber for jets.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.040]   I want a Gulfstream.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.960]   A G6.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.760]   A G6 holds a lot.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.480]   Like a G6.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.560]   It holds like 10 people from here.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.400]   Oh, God, Leo.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.560]   I'm trying to be young like you young people.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.800]   Shannon Morse is also here, our newest host
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.200]   at Before You Buy, and also John C. Devorek,
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.440]   channel Devorek.com.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.320]   Our show brought to you today by our friends at Citrix.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   They are probably the best known remote access company.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:53.920]   Right?
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.600]   Because they invented it.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.120]   They pretty much invented it.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.640]   When Ed Yakobuchi back in the early days of Windows NT put remote access in.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.960]   He was working for IBM at the time.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.280]   They'd lent him to Microsoft.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.000]   Microsoft lent some engineers over to IBM, to us too, and they lent Ed to Microsoft
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.520]   to do the NT kernel.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.480]   And he figured out, you know, hey, we could do great remote access.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.520]   Microsoft ended up licensing it for RDP.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.680]   But Citrix is still in enterprises, the number one remote access solution.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.880]   It's absolutely dominant.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.640]   But there is an easy way to do remote access as well from Citrix called GoToMyPC.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.280]   Same great idea.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.800]   But now you can use GoToMyPC on a Mac, on Windows, on an iPad, an iPhone.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.280]   It even works on a Kindle Fire on your Android device.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.360]   It'll let you access your office computer anywhere you can get online.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.000]   Pretty much anywhere.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.880]   So here's the deal before you hit the road.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.240]   Maybe you want to take Friday off, maybe you want to take a little time off of vacation.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.880]   Maybe you just want to, you know, you need to be able to get to the work computer without
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.320]   driving in to work.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.600]   Go to my PC before you leave work.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.240]   Visit GoToMyPC.com.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.920]   Click the Try It free button.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.600]   Use the promo code to it.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.080]   Now hit the road.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.520]   The apps are free for the iPhone, the iPad for Android.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.040]   Lows you to, that's the weirdest experience to run a Windows machine from your iPhone.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.440]   But it works so well and it means that you can do things like flash that you can't do
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.000]   on your iPhone or your iPad.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.440]   So I want you to check it out.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.280]   It's the missing link that turns your mobile device into your computer anywhere on the
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.280]   go.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   Visit GoToMyPC.com.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.320]   There's a big orange Try It free button.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   Click that in the promo code.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.320]   See that right there?
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.480]   The orange Try It free button.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.120]   The promo code on this is Twitch.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:43.000]   Please use that so that John C. de Vorek can feed his children tonight.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.160]   He took some meat from my freezer.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.160]   Not yet.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   The work freezer?
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   Dude.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.160]   The work freezer.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.160]   No, no.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.160]   No, he has to work me.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   I asked for the freezer baby.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.160]   There we go.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.160]   I explained something to you here.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.000]   There's meat in my freezer.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.480]   That's somebody, a very kind listener, lives in Omaha, Nebraska.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   And sends them Omaha State.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   And sends them Omaha State.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.640]   So I've bombed onto a box.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.680]   You may have, would you like some steak?
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   Totally.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   Please.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   Don't take the ribeye.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.680]   That's for me.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   I've got the filet already.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680]   Girls like filet.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.920]   What's your favorite steak?
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   Probably filet.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.640]   See, I don't know what that is.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.640]   It's just soft.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.640]   There's a buzz fly.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   There's a bug in here.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.640]   Buzz flying around.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   I don't know about that.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.640]   You know where the garbage is.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.640]   That's all I can say.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.960]   We don't need this sort of insult.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.880]   So Apple announced a 13-inch retina display MacBook Pro.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   I think that's exciting.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   Now, is that it?
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   What do you have?
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   I don't know.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   What is that?
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   That's Eileen's old computer.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   That's just an old computer.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   It's a MacBook Pro.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   I think we'll start buying the retinas.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.880]   You know how to use this thing.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   I like the retina.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   And the 13-inch retina is great because you have a lot of high resolution on a 13-inch
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.880]   screen.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.880]   Very thin.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.520]   They announced, besides the iPad mini and the MacBook Pro with retina, they surprised
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:02.600]   people and they announced new Mac minis and a new iMac, which I was absolutely convinced.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:08.160]   When I saw the original pictures, I was convinced that that was a fake rendering.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.080]   Five millimeters thick on the edge.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   What do you mean?
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   You know what's interesting?
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   What?
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   The surface.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   If you go to the...
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.480]   It's a task switcher.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.720]   These programs are all like task switching.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.840]   Oh, it's full screen, yeah.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.520]   That's one thing the tablet experience that I'm not sure I'm crazy about is very much full
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.520]   screen.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.720]   Now, there is a desktop with windowing, but only Microsoft can use it and only for office
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.320]   right now.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.080]   So this is the old iMac.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   Yeah, look how thick that is.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.080]   Look how thick that is.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   I thought this new one was...
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.840]   You don't have the new one, get the new one?
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.840]   No, no one has it yet.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   It won't be out until next month.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.840]   No, that's not one.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   It's not out.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.680]   First of all, I just spent $4,000 on this one.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.880]   Oh, bummed.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.680]   I don't have an unlimited gadget.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   It's kind of high.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   Like the rest you do.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   I think I need to come and get a new gadget.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:07.480]   I actually am very interested in getting this because it's...
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.280]   But you know, there's a bulge.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.280]   This is...
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.520]   I wish they would take pictures of me like this where they just show its side on and
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.360]   you look really thin because there's a very big bulge in the back.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.720]   Oh, they're cheating.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.400]   They're a little bit of cheating going on.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   But they...
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.600]   Well, come on, John, they haven't figured out a way not to have technology.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.840]   I mean, you got to have some computer in there.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.680]   It's not a screen to the fourth dimension.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.800]   My iMac, I have the top of the line of the current generation i7 processor, a lot of RAM
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   or all that stuff.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   And it gets really hot.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.560]   It's hot to the touch.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:46.320]   And if I start doing video encoding on a final cut, it really gets hot.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.040]   And I turn on my fan just because I'm scared of it melting.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.400]   I mean, I get so hot.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.560]   I wonder if the new one gets hot if they've smelled some of the heat.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   Probably just get it.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.560]   It's never crashed.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.440]   It's never smelled bad or anything.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:05.520]   But man, my poor little Logitech camera on the top of this thing is just getting melted.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.600]   I don't think, I have to think that Apple's not too committed to desktop computing, that
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.760]   this is kind of, they didn't announce a new map.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.680]   A lot of people think they're bailing.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.720]   I have to think they know where the money is.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:21.280]   Most of their revenue, 8, they announced $8.2 billion in profit this quarter, by the
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.280]   way.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.840]   That's a decent amount of money.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   Profit.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   Yeah, no, that's good money.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:32.640]   And most of it, I don't know what percentage, but like 80% is mobile, is iPhones and iPads.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.960]   It's not from the desktops.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960]   There's selling them.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.200]   Yeah, I think they're, this is risky.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   You think so?
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   It's not surprising.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.200]   Sometimes I forget that they have those.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.280]   Let me hold up this RT.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   Can I borrow it?
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   There's nothing like having all this last, man.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.280]   There you go.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   Look at that.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.280]   What, how many screens do you have?
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:56.120]   I have a 65 inch TV up here watching the Dallas game and three monitors.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.960]   Robert, do you have like a pathological fear of being bored?
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.280]   I think you do.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.880]   There's nothing like having three monitors, you know?
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.480]   Maybe if you drink less snapples, you will have such a certain need to be entertained.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:17.040]   Well, the iMac only supports two Thunderbolt monitors, so I maxed it out.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.680]   So this is, this is Microsoft Surface RT.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.080]   That's another pro, by the way, this is with a crazy week.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.960]   So on, that was Apple on Tuesday.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.040]   Those are the announcements on Tuesday.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.600]   And given what they announced last month and what they announced this month, they revved
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.000]   every single product in the Apple line.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.680]   Every single one except the Mac Pro, which they say they'll do in September of next year.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.680]   That's amazing.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.520]   I mean, they really, this is a huge product launch for Apple.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.880]   Then on Thursday, Microsoft has a little party and they, now there's nothing we didn't know
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   about this.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.760]   This week, but on Friday, you could buy this.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.240]   This is a Surface, this is the Windows RT tablet and this is Microsoft Surface.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.800]   They're making, you've seen all the ads on the World Series and everything about the
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   click.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   I might as well do that, right?
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.240]   So there's two kinds of keyboards.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.400]   This is the Type keyboard.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.120]   There's also a Touch keyboard.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.120]   These actually are movable.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.120]   They're actually keys, right?
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   John, I mean, they're cool.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   It's fine.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   It's okay.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.120]   It's a little flimsy.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.560]   It buckles a little bit.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.560]   It's not like...
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.560]   Yeah, it's cheap.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.880]   But it does attach with a click like that and vary.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   I mean, you can...
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   Wow.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.880]   You can shake and hold this.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.320]   I mean, it's pretty good magnet, right?
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.680]   That's grimacing.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.480]   It doesn't look like a good idea.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.360]   Well, yeah, you're right.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.200]   It's probably not a good idea.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.120]   So all the reviews were, "Oh, the hardware is amazing."
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:40.480]   And Microsoft was back in the game or whatever we said on those headlines that John gave
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.680]   us heck for.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.080]   But they didn't show any killer apps on these things.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.520]   I'm really shocked that Microsoft's...
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   They have 1,200 software evangelists.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.040]   I used to be one that go around and work with software developers and bribe them basically
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.120]   to get them to build new apps.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.000]   I mean, Rackspace is one of them.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.520]   We built an app for Windows 8 and the bomber just doesn't show off any apps.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.320]   Well, what's a killer app for you?
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.040]   What would be the app that would...
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040]   I'll tell you what...
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   I'll tell you what...
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.680]   I use things from looking at the stars with the...
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   What the sky...
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   Doesn't do that.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.880]   The fire flip board.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   I've had to say.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   Flip board.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   I love flip board.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880]   No flip board.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   There is...
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.440]   Microsoft did make its own news tile and they've hired a hundred journalists to provide
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.440]   content for it.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.520]   So, they're doing something...
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.360]   I'll tell you what the killer app is on this and it really has to do with their audience.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.800]   It comes with Office 2013.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.320]   It comes with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.360]   It doesn't come without look but it does come with Word, Excel, Power...
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.480]   It's the full versions basically.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.120]   You even launch to a desktop which is identical to the...
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   It's a Windows desktop.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.240]   Do you have all the scripts on Excel?
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.800]   Because one thing that is holding people...
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.720]   It does not have a visual basic for apps or whatever the current macro...
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:58.520]   So, people who built these really extensive spreadsheets, i.e. the CFOs that companies
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.120]   still can't move to it until they get all that scripts that they built to it.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.280]   It's not for the CFO.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.280]   It's for the CEO.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.280]   But these are CFOs.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.280]   Because our business...
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.280]   Our business...
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.200]   Lisa who runs the business...
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   First thing she says is, "Where is the numeric keypad?"
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   I don't use...
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   You can't use Excel without...
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.080]   You're doing a lot of number entry.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.240]   You could use a USB keyboard but it would kind of eliminate the advantage of the port.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   What can you put it on this thing?
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.520]   It has a USB port, a standard USB port.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.640]   But I guess my point is that it's not just Apple that is moving away from desktops.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.840]   This is very clearly...
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.280]   To me, this is the Windows 8 device.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   Not the desktops.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.880]   This is what Microsoft wants to sell.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.880]   Good luck.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.040]   Well, Microsoft is trying to stop the bleeding.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:45.240]   I was just on a plane and literally every row had an iPad user and the front of the plane
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.120]   had almost 90% iPad users.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   I.e. the rich people...
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.120]   Rich people.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.200]   I.e. the CEO has an iPad.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:59.920]   You see this when you go to Salesforce Dreamforce or I just spoke at Berkeley's business school
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.440]   yesterday and everybody has iPad.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.360]   Nobody has Surface yet.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.200]   And now, of course not because it just came out.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:15.960]   But Microsoft is bleeding users to Apple and this is clearly a way to stop the bleeding,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.480]   stop people from moving over to iPad.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.320]   And I think they have to make a bigger deal about the Surface.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   But as John pointed out...
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.560]   I think they've done a great job, by the way.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.560]   The ads on the World Series are...
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.560]   For the first time in my life, Microsoft is doing advertising that's like, "Wow, that's
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.560]   pretty cool for you."
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   I agree with that.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   Except at all it's advertising is that the magnet...
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.840]   I mean, it's an advertisement for a magnet.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:45.280]   Oh, they really did a nice job with showing off the UI with the World Series popped into
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.280]   the UI.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   Well, I thought that was interesting.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   You're right.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   I'm saying that.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   That's crazy.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.640]   And it's really smart because right now every geek in Silicon Valley is watching the giant...
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:00.320]   They're spending one and a half Instagrams on marketing this thing.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   That's the new unit.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.320]   It's a good unit.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.960]   One and a half Instagram.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.660]   Actually Instagram, it turns out that Instagram because of the drop in Facebook price was
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.560]   only worth 700 million.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:18.080]   So they're spending two Instagrams, one and a half billion they're spending on this.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:24.440]   But remember, Microsoft, as you pointed out, John, is dominant and Windows is still dominant.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:29.240]   And I think that for Windows users, this is actually a compelling product because you
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.400]   get Office 2013, you get a desktop.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.960]   I actually think that the tile interface is very innovative and great.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.960]   I love it.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.640]   I'm mixed on it.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.160]   When I show it to people, they're mixed.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.280]   But I met a guy who bought Surface and waited in line and actually went and bought it.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.400]   At the Ritz the other night.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:55.240]   And he said he bought it because they support AutoCAD better than the iPad.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.240]   He has a lot of...
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.760]   I don't know if AutoCAD will run on the tablet.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:04.300]   Well, he says you can open the files and use some editing, which you can't do on the
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.640]   iPad.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   That's what he claims.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.240]   Now I'm going to be at Autodesk in two weeks, so I'll get their whole story.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   But...
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.240]   What do you think, Shannon?
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   I mean, you're looking at...
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:18.960]   That's an example of this Windows specific user who's an enterprise user.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:25.960]   And there's apps and things that if Microsoft gets them built, will keep people on the Windows
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   8 platform.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.960]   I don't think...
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   It's far from perfect.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.160]   In fact, it shows pretty much it's...
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.200]   There's a fly on me.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   Now it's me.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.840]   It's a fly in here.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.960]   Apparently this fly has been in here for weeks, according to the memo.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.840]   It's right on your thing.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.840]   Slap it.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.840]   It's...
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.840]   We have a name for him.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.840]   Well, you should get him here.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.840]   It's been here so long.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.840]   I'm getting him with a phone link.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.840]   Let me hit him with a phone link.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.840]   Here.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   Here.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.840]   It's shared.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   It's the...
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   The foam finger does not have enough.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.280]   It's the fickle finger of fate.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.780]   The foam fate.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.780]   What was I saying?
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.840]   Tim, Tim, more just said on Twitter that I'm at a 9.2 and he says I need to dial it back.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.480]   Is that my energy level or the loudest?
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   You're perfect.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.720]   Don't change a thing.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.280]   You are the scobolizer.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.440]   And we love you just the way you are, baby.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.000]   I think there is...
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   It's not perfect.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.560]   It's not fully cooked.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.760]   There are some weird things like, for instance, to rearrange the tiles.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.160]   It's much easier to rearrange the tiles on Windows Phone.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:30.800]   On this, you have to press it, hold it, drag it down, and then you can drag it over.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.360]   It's not completely intuitive.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.680]   There's little things like that that need some work.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.920]   They're not polished.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.400]   But on balance, I think this is very innovative.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   It's very different.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   I think people will get it.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   I don't think it's...
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.520]   You know what's hard to get is on a mouse.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.480]   A mouse and a keyboard on a desktop, you have to have touch.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.880]   I think if you're going to get Windows 8 desktop, you should get a touch screen, even if it's
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.880]   a desktop computer.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.880]   Doesn't touch kind of intuitive and unnatural.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   I've just been playing with this for like five minutes.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.520]   You feel like you understand it?
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.760]   You just got to figure out there's a couple of off-screen ones to bring on the charms I
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   think they call them.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   The charms.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   You figure that out.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.760]   You swipe from the bezel.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.680]   You're trying to bring up your different tabs.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.680]   You figure this all out, see?
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   It's fairly intuitive.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.920]   It's not intuitive in the least.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.120]   Well, yeah, you can figure it out.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.760]   No, she's figuring it out.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   That's not the same as the two of them.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.760]   You know what?
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   You had to figure out the...
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   You won't even know what it was.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.760]   The first time you used iOS, you had to figure it out.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   The first time you used a Mac, you had to figure it out.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.760]   The first time you...
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   You have to figure...
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   You have to figure...
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   These things are not...
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   You have a desktop.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   Yeah, there's an actual desktop.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   That's cool.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   And every website is different.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   We don't complain about that.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   I do.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:41.000]   It's a lively user interface because the tiles are alive, so it scrolls through your messages
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.640]   or tweets or pictures, and it feels friendly and alive.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.240]   I think it's a very friendly desktop.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   I like it.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.240]   It is.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   Isn't it friendly?
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   Yeah, and it feels...
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.120]   I don't want to say intuitive, but it's new and it's fun.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.040]   Don't give it to some but don't give it to a friend.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.600]   All those dirty pictures that you have on there scroll through.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.080]   There's dirty pictures on there.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.080]   Yeah, you and...
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.080]   You naked.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.080]   Me naked.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.080]   I didn't see them.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080]   It was horrible.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.080]   Actually, the...
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.240]   Here we go.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   This is the...
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.080]   So this is the photos.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.080]   This is Twitter.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.320]   I'm just showing for people watching the video stream.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.560]   You can get right to the desktop.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:20.760]   There's a desktop button or you do Windows key D. Shannon found the charms very quickly.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.760]   Let me go back to the...
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.600]   You know, this key has been less responsive.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.440]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.800]   That's a little bit what worries me is the build quality.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.880]   Yeah, it doesn't work already.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.560]   Also, I was able to, on the desktop, I was able to make the icons not work.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.600]   I had to restore the icons through a fairly laborious process.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.520]   But she's talking about moving these charms over.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.280]   This is pretty cool once you figure out what's here to slide them over.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   I don't know.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.200]   I think it's lively.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   It's friendly.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.520]   It's pretty inviting.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.080]   It seems fairly intuitive and easy to figure out.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.080]   Now they like it.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.080]   I like the start screen.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   I think this is...
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.080]   Well, look, here's the point.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.080]   It's innovation.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.560]   What's innovative about it?
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:12.040]   It's taking an established franchise, Windows, and moving it into a touch world.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   And I think that's important.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.040]   But compare that to...
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   It's really new for them.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.520]   Compare that to my Twitter app on my Mac and how often that moves.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.240]   I just don't like the tiles.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.880]   I played with Windows 8 a lot this summer.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.160]   And the apps just aren't the best.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.000]   It's great for somebody who is a casual user of this stuff.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.200]   But I'm always in Facebook on a browser.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.080]   I'm always in Twitter.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.080]   On my phone.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.280]   I'm always using apps.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:44.240]   I love all sorts of different apps from 4 Square to Angry Birds to Twitter to Facebook.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.480]   And I'm never in the app launcher.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.640]   What do you call it?
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.640]   Devorik.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   The slot machine.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   The slot machine.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   I'm never in the slot machine.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.960]   But Robert, are you on a desktop computer or a tablet?
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.520]   What are you using?
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.520]   It depends where I am in the house.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   I mean, I'll tell you what.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.520]   I'll tell you what.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.520]   I'll tell you what.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:06.440]   If you're using an iPad, that whole iPad interface is the launcher.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   That's all you get.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.520]   And all you get is a matrix of icons.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.520]   You don't get anything.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.240]   I'm never there.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.760]   I don't live in that.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.760]   You're living in a desktop?
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.760]   What are you living on?
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.400]   No, I live in the app.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.320]   Okay, so you've got Twitter going.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.480]   But that's all you can see is Twitter going, right?
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.280]   I mean, you switch back and forth.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.240]   You can do the five finger thing over to another app.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.960]   You know, I just don't use the test switcher that often.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.280]   I mean, you know, I see what you're saying.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.880]   You don't go to the home screen ever.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.000]   I don't use the home screen that much.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.040]   I mean, I'm doing my email on a plane.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.800]   I think you might actually use a home screen more.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.920]   You might want to live there more because it's a dashboard more than just an array of
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   icons.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.400]   Yeah, because you also get a lot of information on there too.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.760]   I can switch between apps like this.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.920]   Look, you know, you can do that.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.560]   Yeah, but you can't do it one time.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   You want me to do that on this?
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.760]   I could do that.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   You just go like that.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.160]   You guys like two 12 year olds.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   You go like that.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.080]   I could go like, I could do that.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.400]   What else can you do?
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.400]   What else?
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   Huh?
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   What else can you do, Robert?
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   You're so small.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.200]   Well, get Google working on that.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   No, you can't do that.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.440]   Sorry, there's no Google on this.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.440]   Thank you.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.320]   And by the way, there won't be any Google on iOS either in about five minutes.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.520]   No, that's not true.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.920]   I talked to YouTube yesterday.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.480]   They're coming out with a new iPad app in two weeks.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.840]   They already have with Apple's approval.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.560]   Well, yeah, but Apple's going to prove that stuff only because they have to, not because
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   they want to.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:37.400]   Oh, no, Apple, Apple realizes that if they're going to keep me buying stuff and not going
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.360]   to Android, they better provide the best experience.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.480]   This is a free world now.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.760]   Well, then why does it Microsoft allow me to use Google?
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.800]   I have a Nexus seven right here, baby.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:53.520]   And if Apple wants me to buy their devices, they better support what I want to use, which
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.520]   is you can't.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.960]   You can do YouTube and Gmail and Google Maps.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.480]   And if they don't support that, they're going to.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.400]   Well, okay, let me let me point out something.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.440]   If Google hasn't written a YouTube or Google search app for Windows RT, they're going to
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   have to do that.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   They say they are doing that.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   Well, you can't do it.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.920]   You can't go to a browser and type in Google.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.080]   Yeah, and you can do that.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.080]   But that's how you do it anyway.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.800]   But the default search is being and the default map is being.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   Which I would expect.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.080]   No, I mean, I have Google now.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.840]   The reason I like the Nexus is it has Google now.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.640]   It tells me all sorts of stuff about my next meeting and the weather and all sorts of stuff.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:32.080]   And that is just going to get more and more and more ahead because Google is much more
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.960]   open to developers.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.320]   It lets developers talk to the developers.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.560]   Developers can talk to the Wi-Fi radio that they can't do on the other two platforms.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.160]   That's where Android has a huge advantage.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   I agree.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:49.080]   And I'm switching my mindset from being an Apple fanboy to being a Google fanboy because
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.080]   of that openness.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.080]   Yes.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.440]   And it has nothing to do with the glasses that you got the special deal.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.080]   The glasses are going to be yet another example of this.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.920]   I'm just kidding.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.640]   I'm just kidding.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.800]   The glasses are going to hook into your Android phone and they won't work with Windows.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.360]   Google is never going to work with Windows really well.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:15.720]   Google be grudgingly support Apple because they have to because so many users use Apple.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.520]   So if you go to thank you, Chatham, get your Google back.com.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.760]   Google has Google on Windows 8.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.280]   Get the Google search app.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.520]   Put Google on your start page.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.920]   So in fact, Google has responded.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.760]   Well, I work on the RT though.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.760]   I'm sure.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.760]   Oh.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   Try it out.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.760]   I don't see anything happening.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   Oh.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.560]   On the surface RT, is there a really killer Facebook app?
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.520]   There is on iOS now.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.120]   They rewrote it from scratch.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.040]   It's all Objective-C with a little bit of an original.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.760]   I'm sure it'll work.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.800]   So can I look at all my lists?
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:53.280]   Can I do the things I need to do to be an advanced user on surface RT?
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:47:01.520]   So your argument is that both iOS and Microsoft are too close that the future is with Android.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.280]   I'm yes.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.760]   I'm in agreement with Scoble.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   I don't disagree.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   Well, we're just three.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   Shannon, it's down to you.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.640]   We're going to have a majority here.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.640]   More majority opinion.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.240]   It took me the thing I like about iOS is that it just works.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.040]   Well, she's on those fence.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   Shannon.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.520]   I have bought, I don't know, $12,000 worth of Apple equipment.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.680]   I'm an Apple fanboy.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.360]   I was first in line for the iPhone three different times or four different times now.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.520]   I was first in line for the iPad.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.280]   I love Apple.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.320]   I agree with you that it works.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.560]   And that's why I've resisted Android until lately.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   The Nexus 7, the Jelly Bean OS finally gets into it.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.560]   I agree.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   Jelly Bean's amazing.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.720]   Well, it's still crunky in places.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.960]   It's a lot better and it's a lot smoother.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:53.560]   The difference between it and iOS is this much where it used to be this much, right?
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.440]   And next year, if that trend line continues, next year they're going to pass by it in all
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.440]   respects.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.880]   Market share, openness, fit and finish.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.200]   They hired one of the top guys from Palm who stole--
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.720]   Oh, there you go.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.240]   That's who you want design and stuff.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.240]   It's Tias, right?
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.400]   He runs the butter team at Android right now.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:18.800]   And he's going through the Android and making it that fit and finish better.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:24.160]   And everywhere I hear from the ecosystem, Android is coming on strong.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:28.000]   So this is something for Apple really to worry about.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.360]   And I hear they are worrying about it a lot.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.480]   They just don't have Steve Jobs anymore.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:38.000]   And so they have to come up with some idea of what to do in the future and the different
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   itself.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.240]   You agree with John that $3.29 for an iPad Mini is just-- it makes them not competitive.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.800]   No, I don't think that's not competitive.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.080]   I mean, the surface starts at 500, right?
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.760]   So is the surface at 500 not competitive?
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.760]   Right.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.440]   You know, I think $3.29 keeps them in the game.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.280]   It doesn't lose too much market share.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:02.640]   But I think John is keying in on something that Apple is focusing too hard on margins
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:11.000]   and not hard enough on keeping the bleeding edge user hot and bothered.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.920]   And that will be the end of today's show.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   No, it will not.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   But he will take a break.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.920]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.720]   Channeldevorak.com, devorak.org/blog.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.960]   And of course, the fabulous show without an agenda show.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.400]   It's called no agenda show.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   .com.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   .com.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.000]   We have it on.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   It's on actually.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.200]   If you didn't know this, but I'm going to have to tell you.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.160]   You're waiting for me to say now on twice.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.240]   For some reason, you think that's the funniest thing ever.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.240]   It cracks me up.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.680]   I just love it.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:49.560]   Also Shannon Morse is here from hack five.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   Yes.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.480]   The tech feed YouTube.com/techfeed.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.480]   Your new show is going to be called.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.000]   God, I'm all over the place.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.480]   Yeah, you're working too hard.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.480]   Threat wire.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   Threat wire.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   Threat wire.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   Uh oh.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   Not rottweiler.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   No.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   Threat wire.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   That would be the dog detectives thing.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   I want a threat.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   Can I get a threat?
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.480]   I want a happy on.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.480]   You can have my papillon.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.480]   There you go.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.480]   That'll be the day.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:14.840]   That is our newest producer and host for Before You Buy Our Product Review Show.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.840]   Maybe you could review something.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.840]   I'm going to review the Windows RT surface on Tuesday.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.440]   No, you can keep it if you want to play with it or John.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   I'll take it.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.440]   No, no, no.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.440]   There's actually a fight.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.000]   There's been a fight in the studio for that.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   I think it had an...
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Really?
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Yeah, people really want to play with it.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   It's really cool.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.840]   I cannot help but be impressed by it.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.840]   I have to say.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.080]   Well, it's well made.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.080]   Although flimsy.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.480]   That's hard to say why that is.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   That's a nice one.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.480]   I can't do it.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   Look, I can turn it always.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.480]   Yes.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   Yeah, it was just good, by the way.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.800]   You can turn it always.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   Our show today brought to you by...
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.080]   And Robert's Global Two.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.440]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:58.160]   If you are done going to the post office, then you really need to know about Stamps.com.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.920]   Perhaps you thought the state of the art in postal service was the Pitney Bose that
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   you got no.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.960]   That postage meter, no.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.280]   You leasing that, you paid for the ink, especially ink.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.120]   I always thought you had to have a special ink like the post office machines used the...
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.680]   No, you don't.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.320]   They just charge you for...
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:22.800]   You'll save like 80% by going to Stamps.com using your printer, your computer.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   You don't need a special ink.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.960]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.960]   You buy stamps whenever you need them, whenever you want them at Stamps.com.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.520]   You know what Stamps isn't even the point.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:35.160]   I think they should change the name because you're not putting stamps on an envelope anymore.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.480]   Stamps.com will print the envelope with your logo, with the postage address.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.200]   It pulls the address from your QuickBooks or if you're an eBay or Etsy or Amazon or PayPal
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:51.320]   seller, it'll take that data right from the webpage if you're doing international form.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.320]   Same thing.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   So, prints it.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.320]   Prints the mailing label for the package.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.360]   We're going to show you how to get a USB scale.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:00.840]   It means you don't even have to guess on the price of this postage.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.240]   Just put the thing on.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.240]   It prints it up.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.240]   You never use more postage.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.080]   You always have exactly the right postage.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.080]   Go to Stamps.com.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.080]   Now, wait a minute, Chad.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.240]   I know you've got Stamps.com and there's the scale and that seems like a great deal.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:17.760]   $80 bonus offer, $25 for your postage, but that's not good enough for our audience.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:22.000]   Chad, I wish there were something we could do to really improve that offer.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.040]   $80 doesn't seem fair.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.600]   Why don't you click the radio microphone that says, "Hurt about us on a podcast" and
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.000]   enter "Twit" on there.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.080]   Let's just see what happens.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.080]   Press the "Go" button.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   That $80 offer.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   Whoa!
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.760]   That is now $110 offer.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.160]   You get more free postage.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.240]   You get the digital scale.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.520]   You get the supply kit and the four-week trial.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.520]   I want you to try this.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.280]   If you're not seeing my strange...
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.440]   Do I look strange on that picture to you, Chad?
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.200]   I look old and tired.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   You know what it is?
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   I look like a senior citizen.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   You look humble.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   Humble.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.360]   That's one way to put it.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.360]   Humbold.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.520]   A little touch up.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.360]   I needed some Photoshop on there, don't I?
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   You look great.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.280]   Get the wrinkles, whiten the teeth a little bit.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.320]   Get some brown back in my hair.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.840]   Anyway, go to stamps.com.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.840]   Click the microphone.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:13.200]   Enter the offer code "Twig", ignore the bad picture of Leo and try that $110 bonus value.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.320]   $55 in postage is a good deal.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.320]   So steal.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.720]   Stamps.com.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   We love it.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.840]   We have two accounts because we were fighting over the scale.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.840]   So there.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.000]   Huh.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.240]   You like Papions, huh?
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   Apparently he's like me.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   Papions like you.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   You know what?
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   He is a big flirt.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.440]   Veronica, same thing.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.040]   He just likes the girls.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.280]   He just pops up on the glass.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.360]   I wonder where he got that from.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.080]   You know, he's quite a flirt.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.800]   See, it doesn't work for me in the same way.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.640]   Oh, there he goes.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.400]   Aussie the Wonder Dog.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.920]   He doesn't be famous today.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.480]   Do you have you played letterpress, Robert?
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.960]   Are you playing letterpress?
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   Shannon?
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   No, I'm not a good guy.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   I'm not a good guy.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   The old game center.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.120]   Yeah, that's the game Warren Brechter came out with.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.040]   Yeah, so does it only work in games?
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.800]   So the game, Twitter bought it.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.440]   He worked there for a while.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.160]   Twitter killed Tweety.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.240]   It was the best Twitter client on the max side, but he's a good programmer and he didn't
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:14.200]   give up and he wrote this thing called letterpress, which is a really fun word game.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.360]   But it uses you're playing against real people.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.640]   It's kind of like draw something with a scrabble kind of a thing.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.200]   And it uses game center.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:27.120]   And when it came out, which it did, I think on Thursday, you couldn't use game center.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.480]   It broke game center.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   Hmm.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:36.040]   So it's a statement about how great this game is or a statement of how bad game center is.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.240]   But anyway, fun game, highly recommended.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.200]   We should have put it on space.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:47.000]   You now have to have like every platform because there's one thing on every platform
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.240]   that you want, right?
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.240]   Yes.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.240]   What's your Android pick?
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:58.320]   I think you'd I like I really like the Google app that is a tour guide as you wander
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.320]   around.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.320]   Field trip.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.920]   I took it off because it kept bugging you.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.920]   Didn't it?
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:09.680]   Yeah, constantly pestering me and you get to pay the way there's a building that was
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   torn down in 1850.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.200]   I invented a new form of buttermilk that's been lost.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.200]   I don't care.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.920]   I love that.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.960]   I guess John hasn't figured out how to.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.320]   You can shut it up.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.120]   So you can explore frequent notifications.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.920]   You might figure stuff feeling lucky or turn it off.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:30.920]   See, you don't have to.
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.840]   I know I turned it off and I erased it.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.960]   And then there are a lot of it shows you movie locations, restaurants, see like American
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.720]   graffiti was filmed, filmed 350 feet from here.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.120]   Do you know that?
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.000]   Oh, fascinating.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.120]   So imagine you're walking around with the glasses and you aim at the building and it tells
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.520]   you something about that building.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.240]   That's exactly what I was thinking.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.600]   This is made for glass.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:59.080]   And Google now, which is part of jelly bean, which I also really like because it keeps
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.560]   track of what you search for and what you're interested in.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.480]   So it knows that I care about the giants.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.400]   So it's telling me the giants one yesterday.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   I could swipe that away and it won't come back.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.720]   Like you didn't hear that on the internet.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.240]   Well, you know, don't you check scores on your phone?
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.640]   Isn't that one of the things people know?
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.760]   No, Google now just tells you what they're checking them or not.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.760]   Exactly.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.360]   Well, I was using Siri last night asking it the score and it was quite accurate, by
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.360]   the way.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.360]   It's good that way.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:29.040]   Siri, you can say like what are the giants doing and it will tell you like just like
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.040]   that.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.880]   So these two are getting competition, which is great.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   That's good for us.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.720]   Yeah, it means we'll get better stuff.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.680]   79 degrees in Petaluma right now.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.680]   Unseasonably.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.760]   It says 77 on this device.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.760]   Really?
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.320]   Yeah, Microsoft's a little behind.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.280]   Is wrong?
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.280]   I don't know.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   Is it?
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.280]   What is it really?
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   It's going to 83.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.480]   I don't know if you got a weather bug.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.160]   They have a crowd source weather system so you can get.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.160]   That's a good idea.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.560]   It's like ways for weather.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.000]   By the way, it does.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   Bam.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   Bam.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   No, it says 75.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   77.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.240]   Oh, now it says 77.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.400]   It's changing on the house.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.400]   It's changing so quickly.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.200]   It doesn't say 79.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.760]   See, it says 79 here in this system.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.120]   And then you open it and says 70.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.600]   Did you know that this phone has a barometer in it?
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.600]   Really?
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   No, yes.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.600]   I don't know why.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.800]   That's more advanced than Apple too, by the way.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.240]   Okay, yes.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.240]   But why?
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.680]   It could also have, I don't know, a tire inflation meter in it.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.680]   But why?
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.960]   People like to know the barometric pressure.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.160]   For the skiing app, you need to know the elevation.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.160]   Elevation.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.360]   Elevation is really difficult to figure out.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   It helps you with the maps with elevation.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.520]   Chad Johnson, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.520]   Smart boy.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.360]   It also tells you what other ones have barometer.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.320]   I think it's the only phone with a barometer to my knowledge.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:48.280]   If you're in New York right now, it tells you there's a big ass storm coming.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.760]   Yeah, by the way, I'm just a word to everybody on the East Coast.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.520]   In case you didn't know, there's a big ass storm coming.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:01.920]   Scoble, scoble, scoble, this is the crowd sourced weather show.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.920]   I do hope you're all okay and take care.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.440]   Do pay attention to your local emergency officials.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.880]   So is there a app that shows you the barometric pressure?
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.560]   No, but you could write one.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.600]   So in other words, is a barometer in it that does nothing?
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.160]   Well, they just didn't give you an app.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.160]   Huh?
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.680]   You know, you could put weather.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.680]   What's that?
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.680]   Likely.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:27.320]   Likely power outages likely all over these because from Burlington to Washington, DC.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:31.480]   I mean, we better end the show soon because they're not going to be able to watch it.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.800]   Anyway, we were we actually Joanna Stern was going to be on the show.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.720]   She had a New York City and we had to share to cancel the last minute because of the
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.720]   storm.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.720]   Does she lose your power?
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.520]   No, she's going to high ground.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   Now you know, she's in New York City.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:48.120]   She's just going to building high ground.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.880]   She had to join the newsroom.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.520]   Oh, she had a work.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.520]   She works for ABC.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.360]   Oh, well, that's yeah, that's a good reason.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.360]   It's kind of fun to say she was.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.000]   So she can be out in the storm with the wind blowing and people saying, I'm out here on
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   the wind.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   I'm on the storm.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.640]   By the way, Amazon, obviously everybody's scared about everybody else.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.440]   Apple scared about Android.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.760]   Microsoft scared about Apple.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.960]   Amazon was a little worried about the iPad mini so much so that you saw the competitive
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.920]   comparison they put on the front page.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:23.240]   Jeff Bezos was talking, actually it was an Amazon spokesman talking about Amazon.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.240]   You said Amazon.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:30.120]   Amazon spokesman, the ruher, the nurh, who said interestingly enough Wednesday, the day
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:36.760]   after Apple announced the iPad mini was the biggest sales day for the Kindle Fire to date
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.120]   and up three times week over week.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.440]   And this is according to a statement he mailed to all things.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:46.400]   Now, the interesting thing is the supposition is that people were waiting to see the iPad
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.400]   mini and how much it costs.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.400]   This might confirm what you were saying, John.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:54.560]   And saying how come with Samsung, by the way, when the iPad 5 came out, Samsung S3 sales
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.560]   went way up.
[00:59:55.560 --> 01:00:00.240]   Now, the storm is going to cancel Google's announcement tomorrow.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   Oh, no.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.440]   Because we didn't know what they're going to announce anyways.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.200]   Yeah, but you know, I'm kind of disappointed because it was going to be interesting to
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.360]   watch how they responded to Apple's head to head comparison against the Kindle 7.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.840]   They should have done it in San Francisco like Microsoft did.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.640]   Yeah, or it's so weird because Microsoft had their announcement on Thursday in New York.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.480]   They're coming here on Monday for the Windows Phone 8 announcement.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:27.800]   And then Google slipped in an announcement a couple of hours before Microsoft's announcement.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.320]   They just call out 40 journalists in the industry to Larry Page's office and have a chat.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320]   I mean, come on.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   I guess they could.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.200]   What's the the invite was said, the playground is open.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.920]   Join us for an Android event.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:45.160]   Apparently, another misspey, the apocryphal, but I was told that the venue where Google
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.120]   was going to have this is now an evacuation center.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.760]   So probably a good idea not to have the event there.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.320]   Well, they could still have it and just talk to everybody.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.520]   Talk to the refugees.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.520]   Hey, refugees.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.800]   So a couple of things interesting.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.880]   We kind of knew that they were going to up the memory in the Nexus 7 and, you know, give
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.760]   you more memory for the same amount of money.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:10.880]   So the 32 gig Nexus 7 expected itself for 250.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:17.280]   That does now make it, you know, more competitive in ways against the iPad mini.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.320]   Supposedly, some sources say a $99 tablet.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320]   Wow.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320]   That'd be good.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.000]   And maybe an 8 gigabyte Nexus 7.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.040]   Also a new phone and Nexus phone for smartphone, which would be from LG.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.840]   Apparently, somebody left it in the bar.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840]   Did you see that?
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   Mm-hmm.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.840]   When does that not happen?
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.000]   It's engineers like beer of really long, but do they lease?
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.640]   How many people leaving phones and bars?
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640]   That's what I like to do.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640]   Must be a lot.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.640]   You go to bars.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.640]   You see phone, she's in a row.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640]   You're bigger than I'd have to be.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.640]   I don't know.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.640]   You go to bars.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.880]   I figure it's John and I don't go to bars.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.880]   Not much.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.480]   Yeah, I go to bars like all the time.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.880]   Really?
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.280]   Somebody says web 8.823 says the Nexus Galaxy is a barometer in it.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.720]   The Nexus Galaxy.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.720]   That's the phone here.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.160]   We'll check the barometric pressure.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160]   Siri?
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.200]   What's the barometric pressure?
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200]   No?
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   So...
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200]   It's upside down.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.000]   That's the problem.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.080]   According to Wired, a Google engineer left a Nexus phone, the new Nexus 4, at the 500
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.400]   club.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.400]   A bartender found the phone.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.400]   It didn't have a SIM card.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.480]   It had a Google logo on the back and a not for sale sticker.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.320]   And Dave, a technology regular.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   What would it have a not for sale sticker?
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.560]   Well, you don't want to accidentally sell this prototype phone, I guess.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560]   I don't know.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.560]   You know what?
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.840]   It should say it said something like, "This is a prototype phone, federal law, permit...
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.840]   Exactly.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.840]   So this phone was planted."
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.840]   Well, I don't know.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.040]   The interesting thing is the reaction Google had.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.800]   So Dave figured it out, he called Google headquarters and said, "I have your phone.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.200]   If you ever want to see it again."
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   No, he didn't.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200]   He just called them.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.200]   I have a gun to it.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.640]   And apparently, Google sent a security team, it was not nice about it.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:15.480]   See what I would do is say, "Oh gosh, thank you so much for finding our phone.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.480]   I would like to give you $500 and a free phone if you would just give us to us."
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.080]   When it said they worked the guy over them.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.080]   They threw them over.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.080]   They threatened them.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.880]   I feel like this is a bogus story.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.760]   I believe you might be right, John.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   How on earth do you call Google?
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.960]   How do you call Google?
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.640]   Operator, get me Google.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.640]   Give me Google.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.720]   Actually, there is a number and you can find it by Googling.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   I have found the number.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.640]   Yes, 1-800-thugs.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.680]   There was apparently a riot when I tried whistle.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:55.440]   So according to Wired Magazine, the Brian Katz, Global Investigations and Intelligence
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.680]   Manager at Google, don't want to mess with that guy.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.680]   Oh, there it is.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.680]   Ex-Mossad, right?
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.680]   Here's the number.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.680]   Let's call Google 6502530000.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.680]   Do you want to prank him?
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.680]   Let's call him.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.680]   John, you want to take care?
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.680]   Sure.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.680]   All right.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.680]   John's good at this.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.680]   We'll just call Google for a moment.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.680]   Put the number in the chat so I can call it.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.680]   If you're serious, 650.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.600]   I got to get to the phone thing that we do.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:24.560]   1-800.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.160]   There you go.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.120]   650-253-40.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:33.520]   So this is a Yahoo!
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.720]   I have your phone.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.760]   No, no.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.160]   Let's not prank him.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.160]   I don't want to do that.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   I'm a dangerous.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.000]   I'm Rachel with Account Services.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   That's good.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.880]   Did you know that your car insurance is about to lapse?
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:57.360]   So reportedly, he actually sold Wired magazine pictures of the phone.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.360]   Good for him.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.200]   Google said, "Don't show anybody."
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.200]   This is all publicity.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   I'm not buying any of it.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:10.840]   Anyway, it's apparently a quad-core Qualcomm 1.5 gigahertz yada yada yada with a barometer.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   Is it shape triangt?
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.480]   Is it just another phone?
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.480]   It's the pyramid.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.480]   It's our pyramid phone.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:23.560]   By the way, apparently, these were some of the pictures taken on the phone.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.160]   This is the bartender, I guess.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.160]   He's a good-looking fellow.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.440]   He wanted to get a modeling gig.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.560]   I've vignited a little bit.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.560]   It looks professional.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   Here's the answer.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.560]   Hold on.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   If you know the extension of the party, I'd like to read you.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560]   I have your phone!
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560]   I have your phone!
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   I have your phone!
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.560]   I have your phone!
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.560]   I have your phone!
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.960]   Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.880]   It doesn't work.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:55.640]   Anyway, so Dave sort of freaked out, according to the bartender.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.640]   Google lost a phone.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.880]   You just got a guy fired.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.320]   The Google police are coming.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.280]   Cool.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.360]   After that, then Dave freaked out.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.760]   The knowledgeable guy who called Google, he freaked out.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.920]   He started texting.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.760]   I probably shouldn't have shown it to him.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760]   Anyway, it's-
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.000]   What would anybody say that?
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   You find a phone?
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   Right, that's-
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   It doesn't have any rules on it.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   It's just a phone, a crappy phone in you.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.240]   Can you do a Liam Neeson impression?
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.240]   No.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.240]   Okay.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.240]   Does that be good?
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.080]   I have your phone.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.640]   I don't know if you know me.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.640]   You can't do one either, apparently.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.640]   You don't know me.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:34.640]   I can't do it.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.840]   Let me see.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.840]   I gotta play it.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.720]   I need some taken, right?
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.080]   That's where he does the thing he talks to the bad guys.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:47.160]   Well, do you see Vic and Doutre taking all the pictures with the Nexus 10 on vacation?
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   Really?
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.840]   And here's one of his pictures.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.440]   And the XF says Nexus 10.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.200]   I gotta find Liam Neeson.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.000]   Oh, this is good.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Oh my.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   Oh, he's dangerous.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   What happened?
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.560]   Does Google fall over?
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   Oh, there he is.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.000]   Where's the phone call?
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   Come on.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Didn't sound right.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.640]   I gotta find a taken phone call.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.800]   Here it is.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.440]   Wait, you know, this YouTube is pretty cool.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.480]   You could find almost anything.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.480]   Here we go.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.760]   Here's the scene.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.120]   Is there profanity in this?
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   I don't know.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120]   You can get it out later.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.120]   Then post.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.120]   This is what you do.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   I don't know what you want.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.120]   If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.680]   But what I do have are a very particular set of skills.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.120]   Skills I have acquired over a very long career.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.680]   Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.640]   If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.200]   I will not look for you.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.200]   Okay.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   I will not pursue you.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.760]   I think we could replace daughter with phone.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.760]   If you don't, yep.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.200]   I will look for you.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.600]   I will find you.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.200]   And I will kill you.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   Oh, my God.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200]   Whoa.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.280]   I think that's what we should do.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.000]   That's Dave Katz from Google.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.600]   The Google police.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.960]   The Google police.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.240]   A Brian Katz, I'm sorry.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.680]   Google Investigations and Intelligence Manager.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.560]   Thank you very much.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.320]   How about them keeping the phones on their person?
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.080]   And why would anybody be walking around with this phone with no SIM card?
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]   It's got no SIM card.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.080]   It had no SIM card.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.520]   Well, you know, it's a good way to meet girls.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.520]   Hey, look what I got.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.400]   You know, you know, that one.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.200]   Girls just fall all over themselves.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.400]   If you told me you had the new Google phone.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:45.040]   I think most of you walked backwards slowly.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.240]   I have seen you go far.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.240]   Have you seen it?
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.240]   It's so cool.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.240]   Shut up, ramen.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:56.240]   Let's get high and see what it says.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.560]   Are you happy to see me or is that a Nexus 10 in your pocket?
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560]   Oh.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]   Oh.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:07.920]   Well, that's the most interesting thing that Google supposedly would have been announcing
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:15.880]   tomorrow is a new tablet, a new Nexus tablet with higher resolution than a retina display.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.880]   Retinum Plus.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   Wow.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880]   Count me in.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.880]   We've given them a lot of things.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.560]   We've just really lost all the energy on this show.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.920]   Liam Neeson just sapped it.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.560]   Liam Neeson scared us all.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.560]   You scared me.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.560]   I'm scared now.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.560]   I know.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   I have special skills.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.560]   You need to do a dance.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.920]   You will die.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.040]   Let me tell you about this tablet.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:44.560]   I'm just looking it up here real quickly because this is going to blow your mind, John.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.560]   2560 by 1600.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.560]   Okay.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.560]   All right.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.480]   In a 299 pixels per inch.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.920]   I was hoping it was 4k.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   Quad.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   Dual core 1.7.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.160]   Well, that's almost that's more than high def.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.920]   One facing camera, five megapixel rear camera.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.840]   It would be a Nexus 10.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840]   Dual speakers, see.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.040]   Are they going to sound good though?
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.480]   NFC 16 gigs of storage.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.520]   The real question is what they'll charge for.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   What will be the price?
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.280]   It'll be cheaper than the iPad.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.560]   Subsidized by advertising.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.120]   499 says whistle on the that room.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.080]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.080]   No, 299.
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.080]   What about 299?
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.560]   That would be great.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.560]   For that kind of resolution.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.560]   I am.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560]   I don't think that's mandatory.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.840]   It's mandatory Google Plus account.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.160]   So when you look through the Google glasses, can you like look at is it like augmented react?
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.160]   Could you look at something?
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.640]   It would tell you like what it was.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.800]   That's the idea.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.920]   It has a camera.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.520]   So Google Google goggles already does that.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.840]   And when I look at somebody and I'm supposed to know who they are, but I don't know who
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.200]   they are, will it say that's John Devoir.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.160]   You worked with him for many years.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.520]   Would it do that?
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.400]   That's unclear because they're going to run into privacy concerns there.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   I love that.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.000]   I think Google, both Google and Facebook told me they're just not willing to go toward the
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.400]   face detection until somebody else does it.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.960]   So third party could do it.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.120]   Absolutely.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.200]   We already have, you know, we already have things like highlight that show us people
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.760]   within a hundred yards.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.080]   Did you see this app by the way called Home Snap?
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.680]   No, tell me about that.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.680]   So it's too much.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.680]   I'm sick of apps.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:28.680]   There's too many apps.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680]   Well, that's okay.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.680]   Are you sick of apps?
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.440]   It's like is another app every day.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.080]   It's going to be the next big thing.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.200]   There's 750,000 and I'm sick of them.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.200]   All right.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.400]   Let me, let me take a picture of this house.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.720]   Meanwhile, let's see what he's got here.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.720]   All right.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   Let's see.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:43.720]   Could be cool.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.680]   So you take a picture of the house across the street and it tells you.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.120]   Oh, this is creepy already.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120]   It's all very creepy.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.040]   It tells you how much that house sold for and what it's worth.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.040]   That's Zillow.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.040]   It's Zillow.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.920]   Yeah, but it does it off of a picture.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.520]   So imagine you're wearing Google glass.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.520]   If you look at a house and tells you how much it's worth.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.560]   I would love it if like as you walk around little price tags or around everybody's tags.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.120]   Sounds like a fight club.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.640]   It actually sounds like demon.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.440]   It sounds like that would be cool.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.920]   I liked, you know, you read the book, demon, right?
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.680]   Daniel Suarez's book and in that book and freedom T.M. its successor.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.960]   Every there's, oh, I can't remember if you were a gla, I think you were in glasses, but
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.640]   you'll see everybody's reputation score floating above their head or what their words.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640]   So it's like a cloud.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.320]   Yeah, or what their house is worth, that kind of thing.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.440]   I think that that's the kind of thing we're going to see with Google glasses, don't you
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.440]   think?
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.440]   It's disgusting.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.720]   We don't need that information.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.720]   We don't want to know.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.040]   Yeah, I don't want that information.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040]   You don't think so?
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:47.360]   All right, I'm going to tell you in a moment why it was a very bad day for South Carolina.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.640]   They won in that game.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.520]   Yeah, well, they lost in the game of life, buddy.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.520]   I'll talk about it in a moment.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.000]   The first word from, you know, we'll hear this clip.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.080]   It's so impressive.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.920]   But first a word from FreshBooks, the cloud accounting service for small business that's
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.840]   going to save you time.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.520]   It's going to help you get paid faster.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.600]   If you think about all the time it takes to create invoices to deal with the paperwork
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.840]   to keep track of who owes you money, accounts receivable, that's one of the toughest things
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840]   to do.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.640]   And if you're on your own, you don't have somebody doing it for you.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.720]   Let me tell you, you need freshbooks.com.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.760]   I started using FreshBooks in 2004.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.520]   And it really, it made my life a lot easier.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.000]   They have a new iPhone app that is so sweet.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.160]   You could track expenses, track hours, time and hours, turn the hours into invoices on
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.840]   the phone, send the invoice from the phone.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.040]   Your clients can view the invoices online and pay you right in the spot with a credit
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.400]   card, which means you get paid faster.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.560]   I swear that really works.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.560]   And your account will love you around tax time because your records are organized.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560]   Big difference.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.680]   I love FreshBooks too because they're nice, they're friendly.

[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.200]   for you at an additional fee.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.000]   I want you to try FreshBooks for free.

[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.040]   All right.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.880]   The governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.800]   First of all, I want to thank you all for coming today.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.320]   This is not a good day for South Carolina.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.560]   Not a good day for South Carolina.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.560]   What do you think happened?
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.560]   A storm.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560]   Don't look.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560]   A storm.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.920]   Now, they're all their emails or their private databases got hacked.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.920]   Listen.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:07.760]   And I will tell you, this is one where a lot of people have come together to fix a situation
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.160]   I wish we never would have had.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.160]   No, there's no fix, by the way.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.720]   Wait till you hear what the situation is.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.960]   South Carolina has come under attack by an international hacker.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:23.360]   South Carolina has come under attack by an international, not an American hacker, mind
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360]   you.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.360]   Not one of the nice American hackers.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.520]   No, this is an international hacker.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:33.520]   And listen to what he or she, international hacker, probably somebody named Vladimir, did.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:38.920]   In that South Carolina Department of Revenue and Sled were notified that a server that
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:44.880]   warehouses all of our taxpayer information was breached and taxpayer information was
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   stolen.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.640]   So let me tell you, there are 4.6 million people in South Carolina.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:55.000]   3.6 million Social Security numbers were released to the wild.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.400]   387,000 credit and debit cards numbers that have been used to pay taxes to the state of
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.360]   California were released into the wild.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.360]   South Carolina.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.360]   South Carolina.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.360]   What did I say?
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   California.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.360]   Oh my God.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.360]   That would be a nightmare.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.480]   South Carolina, that's right.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.800]   So three quarters of South Carolina's population.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.840]   Now, but there's good news.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:22.840]   If you're living in South Carolina, they're going to give you a year's free identity theft
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.520]   protection service from Experian.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:31.520]   So all you have to do is go to protectmyid.com and redeem your complimentary membership to
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.120]   the protect my ID alert service from Experian.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.800]   So that's good.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.040]   That's the bright side.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.040]   Geez.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.600]   Oddly enough, apparently none of that stuff was encrypted on the server.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.320]   We're just sitting there.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.320]   You know, seriously.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.960]   That's pretty typical.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:48.960]   It is.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.000]   Why are people still doing that?
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.800]   They don't think anyone gives a crap.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:59.720]   Lack of security in a lot of places is appalling.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.200]   I mean, how many people listen to this show still use its lame ass passwords and don't
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.520]   change them very often and use the same password for every service.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.520]   I agree.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.920]   But I think this estate most is collecting social security numbers and credit card numbers
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:15.080]   has a fiduciary responsibility to its population.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.560]   Yeah, it would.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.720]   But try stealing them.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.720]   Just yeah.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:24.160]   The problem is a lot of people are not very educated and these people get into power.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.480]   I love it that the governor says.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.720]   We're going to fix this, by the way.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:27.720]   No, you can't.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:32.400]   Look at some of the statements from people who are on the National Science Committee,
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:39.920]   you know, it's just appalling that kind of mentality that goes on in government.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.320]   It was an action.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.360]   Put it this way.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.680]   If you're really a smart hacker or somebody who can build stuff, are you working at government?
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.680]   No, right?
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.680]   No.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:51.680]   No.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.680]   You're starting a startup.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:54.680]   You know?
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.680]   That's true.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.360]   I love your work in a Rackspace or Google or Facebook or, you know, Twitter.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.040]   Fox Harrington says they know they had very good security.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.400]   It had very good security.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.040]   It was in an Excel spreadsheet called Totally Not The Social Security Numbers of Everybody
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.040]   in the States of Carolina.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.040]   Right.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.040]   Got Excels.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.040]   That works.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.880]   Yeah, it was very, it was state of the yard.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.640]   It was password protected with guy sex love.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.280]   No, I like guy sex love.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.280]   That was good.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.320]   Facebook reports, third quarter results.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:28.360]   Many people use Facebook every month.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:33.240]   600 million of them now use mobile devices every month.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.200]   That's, you know, 60% right?
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.080]   People who use our mobile products are more engaged says Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:43.880]   And we believe we can increase engagement even further as we continue to introduce new
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.880]   products.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.080]   And did they make money?
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.400]   Yeah, they made some money.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:57.280]   That income in the third quarter of 2011 was $227 million.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.960]   That income in the third quarter of 2012, they lost $59 million.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.440]   But really seriously, it's going to be okay.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:11.440]   Because mobile, people are more engaged and will give us more of their money.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.600]   You know, there's a funny thing that I don't see how mobile is going to improve anybody's
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.600]   situation.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.000]   Apparently, didn't put Facebook's.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.880]   Well, because there's not enough real estate on these little devices to really put a lot
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.880]   of ads.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:24.880]   That's the problem.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   You figure out some other way.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.000]   Now you can buy physical gifts on Facebook now.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.360]   That might be a way they can make a little money.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.360]   Like a BFT.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.960]   Yeah, becoming a middleman for gifts is not.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:40.160]   Did you see that a Bulgarian man bought 1.1 million Facebook email addresses for $5?
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.160]   What's the school of $5?
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.320]   Schoolbills showing us all the ads.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320]   Is that how you use?
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.840]   This is the new thing, by the way.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.840]   That's the new thing.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:51.080]   I see that every time I go to Facebook now, sponsored likes.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.080]   I hate that.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.080]   I really hate that.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.080]   It takes up so much.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.080]   Everybody hates it.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.920]   And it's on your mobile.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:01.280]   It's exactly as John said, it's like you have to scroll down the pages to know the ads
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.440]   before you can see any content.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.600]   And they're usually there are places that I might have gone.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.840]   But now that I saw them advertising for it, I'm like, I don't want to like you.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.560]   I unlike 800 pages in the last week and my feed got dramatically better.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.880]   By the way, if you like, let's say you like Starbucks and they buy a sponsored ad, that's
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.400]   how they're doing that to get increased reach.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.800]   Because if they don't do that, they'll only get seen by 10% of the people who are following
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.280]   them.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:31.440]   And so what Facebook did was increase the number of those sponsored, not just those
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.240]   sponsored likes that I just showed you, but sponsored things.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.440]   So I unfollowed anybody who's a big company and my feed got dramatically better.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:42.200]   Well, but wait a minute, Robert, it says right here, Robert Scoble likes my energy.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.280]   Yeah, tell me about that.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.800]   Now, do you get paid for that?
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.480]   You get the big bucks?
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.000]   No, I wish you get nothing.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.880]   It's because in my fashion, yeah, I thought that they could go this illegal.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.800]   Now, let me like hold on.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.000]   My energy, you said?
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.720]   So it says pages, pages you may like.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.440]   And then one of them is Facebook stories because Gina Smith likes that.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.440]   These are the ad.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.440]   These are sponsored.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.440]   I just like it.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.440]   Good unlike them.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.320]   Robert Scoble likes my energy.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.320]   And I am more.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.200]   I'm actually watching my friends feeds to see all the stuff that I'm getting for.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:21.440]   So I actually don't, you know, me and you argued about that before that that you get
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.000]   paid by endorsing things and you see that as an endorsement that you're not getting
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000]   paid for.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.200]   Me, I see it as a distribution for my name.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.480]   So all my friends, like you just saw my name that gets you.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.480]   Well, that's not a habit.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:38.400]   I can't go to Facebook without finding out what Robert Scoble likes.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.280]   Apparently now Robert Scoble and Tom is hawk like NASDAQ.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:45.760]   Hey, you know, I like NASDAQ.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.320]   Rackspace is on NASDAQ.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.320]   Stop, stop liking things, Robert.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.400]   And maybe, maybe I won't get ads from you.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.560]   I unlike 800 things over the last week.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.400]   So you'll notice fewer and fewer of those.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:02.640]   And I'm, by the way, I built a list of 1600 startups, which is really, really fun to watch.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.800]   And that's where I'm going.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.200]   I'm taking all those likes from the big companies right now.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.200]   In fact, let me, I'm like, how can I?
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.800]   How can I unlike, how do you unlike people?
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800]   Here, let me show you.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.000]   You have to go up to the top to your tracks.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.480]   All right, you go to NASDAQ.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.040]   Or wait, no, your likes wherever.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.040]   There's a likes list.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.000]   You ever use this Leo?
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   Have you used this product?
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   What is this thing?
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Oh, here it is.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   Here's my likes.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   Okay.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   And I like Justin Bieber.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   And you have to click into the page.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   See?
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   I like Metallica.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.400]   Clearly, somebody has hijacked my page.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.000]   Here's the page for NASDAQ.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.520]   So you just told me about NASDAQ.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.320]   And you click on the like, on the like.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.960]   And then down here, there's unlike.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.960]   So why?
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.960]   The real problem is--
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.960]   There you go.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.960]   See you later, NASDAQ.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960]   Sorry.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.960]   The real problem is that you don't know what you're seeing.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.880]   What your friends are seeing, because it doesn't ever show you, right?
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:55.880]   Right.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.960]   So you have to have a buddy system where, hey, Shannon, would you tell me if my name shows
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.960]   up in your Facebook feed as an ad?
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.360]   Yeah, I could tell you what I see, but you won't see it yourself.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.240]   And then I won't see it, because I don't know.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.800]   I've just been unliking any big company on my likes page.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   So--
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.360]   Well, I'm taking Justin Bieber right off, that was.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.080]   And also, I just unliked all the movies.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:24.040]   And I'm going to go to TV stations next, because it limits you to 5,000 likes.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.040]   So I want--
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040]   Oh, no!
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.040]   How did you find that out?
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.040]   Horrors!
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.040]   How would you find that out?
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.040]   Because I got to 5,000 likes.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.040]   5,000.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.880]   Why do you like so much stuff?
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.520]   Well, look at my life, Peter.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.160]   I like-- let's see.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.160]   Red lasers a startup?
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.160]   I like red lasers.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.560]   How do you keep up with all that?
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.800]   Because don't they start spamming your news feed?
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.440]   No, no, no.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.440]   These are startups.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.080]   They have no money to sponsor anything.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.360]   I like buttermilk sky, internet phenomenon.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.680]   That's a goat.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.880]   Like here's-- you know, circus and news.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.880]   Here's a--
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.280]   What did I like a goat?
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.280]   Internet phenomenon.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280]   What?
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.080]   I don't understand.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.400]   Onward to the next topic.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.400]   All right.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.400]   Angry Birds.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   Angry Birds.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.400]   No, but there's some things I like.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.400]   American Idol?
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.400]   I like American Idol.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.400]   I like--
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:23.760]   So Facebook, by the way, responded to this breach of $5 for this $5 breach and said,
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:31.800]   "Well, Facebook's investigation included contacting the guy who bought this Bulgarian
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.880]   shop off and asking him to send them the data, delete it, and remove his blog post mentioning
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.880]   his purses."
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.880]   Yeah, because that's definitely going to take it off the internet.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.880]   He actually--
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.120]   Look at the key stations I like, Leo.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.800]   Hey, we're off the topic.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:45.800]   There you go.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:46.800]   There you go.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800]   I like that.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.800]   By the way, I deserve a little-- I don't want a globe.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.360]   I'm not going to globe.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.360]   Okay.
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.360]   A little victory lap, though.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360]   Is that okay?
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360]   No, but go ahead.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   Because you know, g4--
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.840]   Why should I play a house ad and then I'll get it over.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.840]   You know, I wonder what's coming up.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.840]   No, no.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.600]   We're going to do the house ad in a second.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.600]   Thank you for reminding us.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600]   Oh, you're welcome.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.480]   But I did want to know that g4 is now moving away from tech.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.840]   They're canceling-- and actually, I'm sad to hear this.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.840]   X-Play, because my friend--
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.560]   Oh, what's her name is that?
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.560]   What's her name?
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.560]   Morgan Freeman.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:18.560]   Morgan Freeman.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.720]   And no, Morgan Ferch, I know.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.720]   What's her name?
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720]   Morgan Webb.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.720]   That's it.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.720]   There you go.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.720]   And your pal.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.920]   Well, it's personal friend.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.440]   And no, I love Morgan Webb.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.320]   And so I guess she's out of a job.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.440]   And "Attack of the Show," which I'm really glad to see it canceled, because that was,
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.760]   you know, their fake screensaver show.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.240]   So bye-bye.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:44.040]   I'll tell you what, just to give you-- so there's that.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.720]   There's American Ninja.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720]   There's cops reruns.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.720]   There's "Attack of the Show."
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.720]   There's X-Play.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.640]   Or you could have watched "Twist" this week, and this is what you would have missed.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640]   Huh.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.840]   Last time on "Twit."
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:56.840]   "Twit Live" specials.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.360]   These are the places they never imagined.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.440]   In manners, they never have before.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.200]   Oh, what's that?
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   That looks like a smaller version of the iPad.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.400]   I think that's an out of scale, I thought.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400]   No, that's a galaxy note.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.400]   Who called it?
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400]   iPad Mini.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.400]   The Mini?
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.400]   That should call it a iPad.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.560]   You were right, Sarah Lane.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:19.640]   Before you buy, buy, try, don't buy for the 27-inch Shimmian monitor.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.640]   I'm going to say buy.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:28.040]   I am really glad that I personally purchased this monitor Windows Weekly.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.920]   Houston, we're going to dock.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.920]   Do it together.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.920]   Ooh, it's snicked.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.480]   Do it again.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.920]   So that's the touch keyboard docking.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.000]   I'm going to let go of it.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.920]   And we've now done exactly the same thing that Microsoft did on purpose.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:45.920]   By accident.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:46.920]   No.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.440]   If I go up on the roof, it might be better.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.440]   Yes.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.440]   What does this say danger on here?
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.840]   Because if you were going to put that on the roof, you might have--
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.840]   it might attract lightning.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.840]   So you have to ground that properly.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:26:59.520]   Twit.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.840]   Now with half the calories.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.480]   Thank you to Joe Keller, who's a great voiceover guy.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:08.520]   What is the eight bow tie doing up there?
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.640]   What's the point of it?
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.400]   That was-- we were showing you how to get HDTV over the air.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.840]   Can you hit-- well, I do that.
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.640]   Oh, really?
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.640]   Free over the air HD.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.240]   It's better HD2 than the compressed dish.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:19.240]   Yeah, no, I know.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.000]   I get over the air.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.680]   But could you hit the Mount Sutra with that thing?
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.280]   Not well, on the roof maybe.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.160]   I wasn't able to get it.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.560]   I was able to get the Santa Rosa public broadcast.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.560]   That's it.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.480]   Stinks.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.320]   We're in a--
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:31.840]   We're in an eight--
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.840]   Because we're in our north.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.480]   With an eight bow tie, you should be able to--
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:34.840]   You should be--
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:35.560]   --in Sacramento.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.000]   It's pretty true.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:36.840]   You should try Sacramento.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.800]   We'll do an eight bow tie.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.160]   Is that-- is that your right?
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.160]   That was an eight bow tie?
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.720]   Well, we should try it again.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.600]   Well, aim at it, Sacramento.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:44.600]   I was afraid of getting electrocuted.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.400]   Sacramento, not south.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.680]   It'd go this way.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.280]   But take a shot at it.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.360]   That's a good idea.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:50.960]   Yes.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:51.880]   Well, it's a know-how.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.720]   It's our latest know-how.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.240]   We show you how to get free HD over the air.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.800]   And he found a great site better than Antenna Web.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:01.360]   What was it called?
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.040]   TV Folly or something like that?
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.240]   TVFolly.com.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.960]   It was really a good site.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.200]   No, it's not in.
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.280]   Ah, I can't remember.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.080]   You have to watch the show.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.000]   TV-TV.com.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.920]   Travel now to--
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.120]   TVFool.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:20.960]   TVFool.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.560]   TVFool.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.400]   Really great site for finding your--
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.000]   what stations you can receive and what the signals are.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:30.760]   It's amazing.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.280]   It's cool.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:31.960]   Oh, it's a great site.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.280]   Signal analysis tool.
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.480]   Yeah, it's really good.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.000]   I need to do that.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:35.760]   Highly recommend.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.680]   Comcast just canceled-- they made everything digital
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.800]   in the area that I live in.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.880]   Yes, it has to be encrypted.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.640]   So I lost my CW.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.560]   I was so upset.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.040]   No more vampire stories.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.920]   What are you watching this?
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.200]   So vampire stories.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.800]   Ooh.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.560]   I do that show Bike Club.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.120]   You're on Bike Club with--
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:54.640]   What's Eileen?
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.120]   Is Veronica on that too?
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.440]   No, it's Eileen, you and--
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.680]   Me, Linfu, Josh.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.440]   That's right.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.800]   And Stephanie, you.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.440]   So it's for people who like vampires.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.320]   I like to get bitten.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.520]   Werewolves, zombies.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:07.960]   We don't necessarily like it.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.120]   And everyone in the audience will get to bite her later today.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.000]   What's the best vampire show out there?
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.320]   Oh.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.000]   Show?
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:16.520]   Maybe.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.600]   Anything, movie, show.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.600]   OK.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.600]   Anything.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.680]   If I wanted to get introduced-- if I had never heard of vampires
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.960]   and I wanted to get introduced to the whole subculture
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.840]   of vampireism, what would I--
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:25.800]   That vampireism.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.320]   Should I--
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.000]   Buffy, Twilight.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   Ooh.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:29.960]   I mean, what's--
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:30.480]   Buffy.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.320]   I mean, that's a classic.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:31.920]   That's a classic.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.440]   Yes.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.120]   Buffy.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.080]   I'd say vampire diaries, but you probably
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:35.680]   want it like that.
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.000]   I read the Anne Rice books.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.160]   I like the vampire list.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:38.920]   Those are good.
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.760]   We're totally off topic.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.280]   Angel.
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.080]   Brother.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.400]   True Blood's pretty good.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:43.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:44.400]   That is awesome.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.800]   I got to get back to the island though.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:45.800]   Ooh.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.800]   Tech news.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.320]   Ooh.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.320]   That's one of my favorites.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.240]   Whoof.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.960]   Netflix says Amazon is gaining and gaining,
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.120]   and HBO is coming.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:30:00.360]   Basically Reed Hastings said, ah, I'm Trump.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.520]   This is kind of depressing.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.440]   I like Netflix.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.600]   Don't you love Netflix?
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.280]   Who doesn't love Netflix?
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.560]   I watched four seasons of Breaking Bad on Netflix.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.080]   Yes.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:09.600]   Yes.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.520]   Awesome.
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.840]   That's a little too much to watch.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:15.280]   That's not good for your brain.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.720]   Let it just share mothers.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.600]   It was like doing math, man.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.520]   Let it share her whole, I guess they have to, because they're a publicly held company.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.640]   They have to tell their shareholders this.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.680]   Amazon is starting to make a headway with their prime streaming.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.360]   That's actually, Amazon's streaming is pretty good.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.960]   It's pretty much the same stuff, right?
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.240]   And if you're a prime member, it's free.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:39.040]   So that's a good deal.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:44.520]   Netflix says that despite denials by HBO and Time Warner, they believe that there will
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:50.960]   be web only versions of both Time Warner and HBO competing directly with the Pay Channel
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.920]   via an Allah cart web offering in the US.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.840]   They did it in Sweden, right?
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:01.800]   HBO Go was in Sweden, even if you didn't have a cable company.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.040]   I want that so much.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.040]   What Sweden?
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.040]   HBO.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.040]   HBO Go.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.040]   HBO Web only.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.200]   Without having a cable for that, you bet.
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.200]   I would happily pay for it.
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:17.480]   Zinga chose the Apple announcement to fire a bunch of its staff.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   That's smart.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:23.440]   If you had bad news, you were caught having sex with an intern.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.400]   The best time to do that would be during an Apple announcement, right?
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.400]   That would be my guess.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.400]   That's when you'd get-
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:33.280]   Five percent staff reduction, 13 game closures.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.520]   See nobody heard about it.
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.520]   The Ville apparent.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.520]   Did you ever play the Ville?
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.520]   I didn't play the Ville.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:40.520]   What is the Ville?
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.520]   It's another one of them.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.920]   Those are some farming games.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:51.440]   Apparently, they're significantly reducing their investment in the Ville, sunsetting 13
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.880]   games that are older.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.400]   Why is Zinga not doing well?
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.200]   They were on top of the world.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.840]   The games don't have really interesting characters.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:04.520]   They're cartoony, they're lame, and they're copies.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.520]   That's why I play-
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.840]   I guess that summarizes it.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.320]   Simpson's tapped out.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.680]   I told Mark Pinkestus.
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:18.360]   I said, "Your games, you need to go to Disneyland and study what Pixar does with character development.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:23.480]   They don't have any characters I care about until they do."
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:30.040]   You haven't lived until you've had Homer Simpson say, "Push notification on your iPhone."
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:34.520]   I swear to God, it's the funniest thing ever.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.160]   How much have you played of this game?
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.240]   How many hours have you put in?
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:42.400]   I just started playing it so only a few hundred.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.480]   It could go on for quite a while because it's the Simpsons.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.400]   It's Springfield.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.960]   What happens, the plot is that Homer has blown up Springfield through an attention.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.600]   He keeps playing with his My Pad.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.120]   You have to see there's some zombies.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.120]   You have to squish.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.120]   You would like this.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.400]   That's for Halloween.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.480]   You have to rebuild Springfield.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:05.200]   There's the Quickie Mark.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.400]   All the characters are in it.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.160]   Don't you rebuild the donuts or something?
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:13.320]   You cannot connect a server.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.320]   Maybe you hit retry.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:15.720]   It drives me crazy.
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:16.720]   All the games do this.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.400]   They don't know what.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.040]   Anyway, very addictive.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.040]   Very addictive.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.040]   You put any money in there?
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.040]   Exactly right.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:29.680]   Because they have these Simpsons, you know, you can buy donuts and I refuse to buy donuts.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.680]   Look at this.
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:31.680]   This is where the money is.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.440]   After listening to Gibson going on and on, I can see why.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.760]   You go to the donut store.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.240]   You can sit, you know, you could be, you could cheap out.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:42.280]   For a buck 99, you get a dozen donuts.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:49.480]   Or for a hundred dollars, real American money, you can get a boatload of donuts.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.480]   $2400.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:51.480]   What do you mean $100?
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.040]   $100 American money.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.920]   What are you talking about?
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:34:00.200]   You mean telling me that I'm going to give them $100 and then I get some bogus virtual
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:01.200]   donuts?
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:02.200]   Yes.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.200]   But they're an idiot would do that.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.840]   Verily, quite a few.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.840]   Or maybe not.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:07.840]   Maybe that's why Ziggas in trouble.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.640]   Are you raising your hand, Robert?
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:10.640]   I don't play these games.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.640]   I just want to.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.160]   Well, there's some things you can't do.
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:17.160]   Like, okay, see, if I had 80 donuts, I could build the Aztec theater.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:20.160]   Fantastic.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.160]   Or the Duff Brewery, 190 donuts.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.160]   Nice.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:23.160]   Hack it instead.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.240]   Oh, could you help me with that, Shannon?
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.240]   Because I'd really would.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.240]   You could try.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.400]   I want to save money on donuts.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.400]   This is really good.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:33.640]   Otto, you get Otto and he crashes to school bus and he just stands out there drinking.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.640]   It's actually really good.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.240]   But it's 120 donuts.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.240]   And I don't really.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.080]   So you have to earn donuts.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.440]   But donuts, you earn at a glacial pace.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.720]   Like I have, you want to know, I got three donuts.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.720]   Oh my god.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.720]   That's so good.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.800]   I play Instagram.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.360]   That has real life, you know?
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.360]   No, no, no.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.200]   But it doesn't have a Homer Simpson and Ned Flanders in it.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.200]   You never know.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:03.360]   See, because it's Halloween, people are coming around and they're tee-peeing my trees.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.360]   That's fun.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.040]   It's a good game.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.120]   That sounds like real life.
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.600]   There's cleat is going through the dumpster.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:10.600]   Oh, something's on fire.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.600]   No, that always burns.
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.440]   That's a Springfield tire yard.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.440]   Yeah, it's always on fire.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.440]   I mean, it's a show.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.360]   Well, that's what's great.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.440]   If you're a fan of the show, I think this is smart.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:23.280]   Now they probably pay a lot of money to Matt Groening for this.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.080]   But you're absolutely hit the nail on the head.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.160]   This is much more compelling in some weird way than it would be if we're just some strange,
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.920]   you know, "ville."
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.760]   You're driving us nuts, Leo.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:37.760]   You're watching it, though.
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:38.760]   That's what's interesting.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.760]   You're actually watching it.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.160]   We're totally getting into the game.
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.160]   We're totally getting into the game.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160]   We'll be able to come out with loading terrain and transmitted it.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.840]   Oh, by the way, we broke TV Fool.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.840]   It's still down?
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.400]   No, it's not down.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.840]   It's just the loading the terrain and transmitter database.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.240]   So what happened when I asked?
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:57.760]   When I asked and I showed TV Fool on KnowHow, it went down almost immediately.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:59.760]   That's real life, whatever.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.000]   That's my kid in a Halloween party.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   That's Milan.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000]   Milan in a time lapse.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.600]   Oh, I thought it was up to which coffee.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.600]   That's Ryan there.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.600]   Oh, right.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.600]   And this is other people now.
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.920]   So what time I accept, what time I accept?
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.220]   This is light with two T's at the end of it.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:23.200]   And it takes a picture, 10 pictures every time you push the button and you can scrub through
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.680]   the pictures like this.
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.680]   It's really, really pretty cool.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.680]   You just have an explosion in Half Moon Bay.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.680]   No, I'm doing fine.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:29.680]   Why is that?
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.600]   That was you, Leo, whatever thing your computer.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.040]   I think I blew up spray.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.040]   Something big happened.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.240]   Oh, I should have bought those donuts.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.240]   It was just a really cool app.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.240]   It was boom.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.840]   Anyways, that's light.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.600]   L-I-G-H-T-T.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.960]   I was going to show because I got the new GoPro camera.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.640]   So GoPro Zero 3, that's what the sound is.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.200]   It's a GoPro video.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.680]   It's that cool.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.240]   They've really updated these cameras.
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:01.440]   And I'm going to Australia after next week and I wanted an underwater camera.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.680]   You're going to Australia.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:03.680]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:04.680]   What a great barrier reef.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:07.760]   Oh, you're going to go to the New Zealand and visit the South Island?
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.960]   No, no, it's a cruise.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:09.960]   So I'm just going where the boat goes.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.960]   It's one of these cruises.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:11.960]   Yes, it's a geek.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960]   You're going to be speaking at the cruise.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:13.960]   Yes, it's a geek cruise.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.960]   What do you say at these things anyway?
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.960]   Not much.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.120]   I sit down and I say, "Let's talk."
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:20.120]   You mean.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:20.960]   I need you to do about an hour stand up.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:21.960]   I do four lectures.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960]   I do four lectures.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.200]   I'll do a lecture on social media for business, social media for personal media.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:33.640]   Personal, how to do your own multi-million dollar internet broadcast operation and then
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.640]   something else.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.640]   The others.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.200]   Fascinating, huh?
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.200]   Yes.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:41.080]   But we're going to see a total eclipse, John, because there's a total eclipse down there.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.080]   If there's no clouds.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.080]   You can take pictures.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.760]   No, but that's why you're on a boat because you sail to the clear skies.
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:47.760]   Just like that.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.760]   Just like that.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.080]   The captain plans ahead.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:52.080]   He gets a map.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.640]   He says, "That is Dutch.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.120]   What would happen tomorrow in the morning for the eclipse?"
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:01.680]   There's going to be anything like the Antarctic trip that you made.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680]   That was a good one.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.680]   Wozniak and I stay.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.680]   Now, that made me mad.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.680]   This was another one.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.720]   We were in South America.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.040]   For $1,500, they would fly you to Antarctica and you'd wander around and take pictures of
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.040]   penguins.
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.000]   Woz was on a bunch of others.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.920]   We all suited up for 40 below weather.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:19.720]   We thought it was going to be very cold.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.720]   I told you this.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.800]   They do a whole drama where a guy comes out and says, "No, no, we can't go there."
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.800]   Weather's not good enough.
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:27.800]   Have you ever gotten there?
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.920]   No, we've never made this excursion.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.640]   But don't worry because we've got the plane.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.720]   We're going to go somewhere else.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.720]   Where was that?
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:38.720]   It was some national park.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.240]   It was actually beautiful, but it wasn't Antarctica.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.280]   But Woz, and this is what gets me.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:50.360]   I'm for the rest of the day sweating in Antarctic wear, wandering around this place.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.520]   Woz strips down his shorts.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.760]   He's wearing shorts under his Antarctic stuff.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.080]   Oh, good for him.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.080]   He's a smart man.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.080]   He's a head.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.080]   I think in the head.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.520]   The GoPro camera rocks, though.
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:02.240]   Have you tried the new one, the three?
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:03.240]   I don't have it.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.720]   It was about 200 yards from my house.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.720]   I'm excited.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.120]   It's a third to size.
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.120]   It's tiny.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.080]   Are you going surfing or anything like that?
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.080]   I'm going to.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:17.720]   It shoots at 120 frames a second, so you can do these super slow-mo kind of things.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.480]   Yeah, I'm going to snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.120]   I got the underwater housing.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.080]   The reason I thought of it does time lapse.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.360]   It's also a super slow-mo and time lapse.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.760]   That's cool.
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:29.760]   You know what's going to happen, though?
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.880]   I'm going to shoot all this footage, and then I'll never get around to doing anything
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:33.880]   with it.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.880]   You don't have time.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.320]   I'm surprised you have time to take these.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.800]   You edit all their home video.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:38.800]   Do you do that?
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.800]   No way.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.800]   Nobody.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.800]   We just take these pictures.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.800]   I do.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:43.800]   Really?
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:44.800]   I don't even take videos anymore.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:45.800]   I don't edit my videos.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.800]   That's why they're long and boring.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.880]   I have to tell us what we don't know.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.400]   Somebody said, I can't remember who, and I wish I could, that this is the beginning
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.600]   of history, because unlike, you know, you can't see what Abraham Lincoln looked like,
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.680]   but we will now know from pictures from Brady.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.280]   Yeah, but not, okay, that's the closest you can get, but from now on, we're going to
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.080]   have lots of video of everybody.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.080]   No.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.080]   Always.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.080]   I have refused that my picture taken.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.080]   No one will know.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.040]   A hundred years from now, they'll say, what did John C. DeVoir act look like?
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.960]   No one knows.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.960]   No one has any idea.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:24.160]   You should get a very highly idealized portrait painted of you, and then people think you
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.160]   look.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:32.280]   I went to the Autodesk operation and had a meeting, and I sat in their 3D thing.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.920]   You know, Autodesk is the leader right now in making...
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:38.960]   Have you played with one, two, three catch?
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.960]   There's an app.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:40.960]   There's a bunch of stuff they've got.
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.200]   But then on the iPhone, in the iPad, you take picture, I do it.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.600]   I can get a 3D model of your head in about five minutes.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.280]   Well, they have this array of cameras.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:49.680]   You sit there and you push the button.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.680]   Right.
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.840]   You take the pictures, and then it makes a 3D app which you can upload.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.600]   A 3D model which you can upload.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.600]   It's really amazing.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.800]   One, two, three catch, it's called.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:01.800]   Free!
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:02.800]   One, two, three, D catch.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:03.800]   One, two, three, D catch?
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:04.800]   Yes.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.800]   Yes, you're right.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:06.800]   One, two, three, D catch.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.160]   So I should make a 3D model of Shannon.
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.000]   Do you think?
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000]   Oh no.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000]   Maybe after the show.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000]   I might break your camera.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000]   No.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000]   Break the...
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.560]   There was an old line break the camera.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.920]   Number of self published books tell Jay Estes.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:24.480]   Up 287% since 2006.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.480]   Everybody's doing this.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.480]   Because why would you use a publisher?
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.480]   What do you gain?
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:29.480]   Nothing, actually.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480]   You lose money.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480]   They take your money.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.480]   Last year...
