[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.600]   And we have a very, I think, an important twit this week, which doesn't mean it shouldn't
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.640]   be interesting and fun.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.960]   But we have some important topics to introduce.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.200]   Let me first introduce our panelists who are joining us this week.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.840]   Formerly of Pebble.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.560]   Before that you were an engadget, right?
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   That's right.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560]   Miriam Jwara is here.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560]   Great to have you.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   Hi everybody.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   Nice to meet you.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   And what are you doing these days?
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   I'm looking for a gig.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.840]   So if you guys want to ping me for something really...
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   Higher Miriam.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840]   Yes.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   I'm, you know, I've got some time.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.640]   But you know, even when you were at Pebble you continued to cover mobile, you covered
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.960]   all of that stuff.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.840]   So, and frankly I got to be honest with you.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.400]   I don't know, given Android Wear and the imminent Apple Watch, if there's much future
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.880]   for Pebble to be honest with you.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   Android Wear.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   Oh, she's wearing a Mona360.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.040]   She's wearing a Mona360.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.640]   That means you, my friend, have our apostate.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   You have left the phone.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   Wow.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.440]   It's like, you know how I review phones on my blog?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.480]   And I can't make, I can make up my mind every day changes.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   I'm like 360.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   I still wear my Pebble.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.120]   It's just today was a 360 day.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   I love my 360.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.480]   You know, last night we were watching a movie, I paused it from my watch.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480]   No, it wasn't amazing.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   It was cool.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   Nice to have you, Mary.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   I'm also here.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.280]   Mike Masnick, who I didn't know, but Mike's been on Twitch once before.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.840]   Like 300 episodes ago.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.880]   Many, many, many years ago.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280]   But I'm a huge fan of tech dirt.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.800]   I read it religiously, mostly because of your commentary, although you've gone well beyond
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   that.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.160]   But for years, like since the late 90s, tech dirt, and it always felt like it was you,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.600]   Mike, like kind of the voice in the wilderness shouting against government surveillance against
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.400]   big companies about copyright, copy protection.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.720]   In fact, really, I remember you most as somebody as just an opponent of copy protection in
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   general.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   Now, tech dirt covers everything.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.080]   Well, I mean, we've covered a lot of things for a lot of time.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.440]   And yeah, I think a lot of people probably associate us with the copyright stuff, but
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.960]   it's whatever's happening in innovation technology, technology policy that we think is interesting.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.320]   Today is going to be a different to it because we're going to begin with a conversation about
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.320]   net neutrality.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.560]   President Obama on Monday announced his support for something that I think the EFF and a lot
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.520]   of privacy advocates and net neutrality advocates have suggested, which is that the FCC should
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.480]   regulate internet service providers as common carriers.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.840]   This is a provision of the Telecommunications Act.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.400]   Some have said, you know, that's a bad idea.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.840]   That's over regulating it.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.680]   Title II allows things like rate regulation.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.720]   Others have said it's the only way the FCC can reasonably prevent paid prioritization,
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.400]   fast lanes.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.360]   And I think we all agree that's something we don't want.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.920]   So I thought what we do is bring two people here who have quite a bit of an interest in
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.320]   what the FCC is about to do to internet service providers.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.680]   You've probably remember Brett Glass from his appearance on security now a few months
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680]   ago.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.000]   He is a wisp.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.560]   He does a wireless internet service in Laramie, Wyoming.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   Great to have you, Brett.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.360]   Yes, good to be here.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.760]   For many years a tech journalist, a commentator, but this is your full time job now is providing
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.760]   internet service for the small town of Laramie.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.360]   It is correct for Albany County, Wyoming with an average population density of five people
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.120]   per square mile.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.080]   Some particular challenges there with being an internet service provider.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.320]   I'll agree.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.640]   We also have with us an old friend, a guy who's been on the screen savers.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.640]   I've known him for years.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   Dane Jasper.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.680]   He's the CEO and founder of one of the best internet, independent internet service providers
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.400]   in the country, SonicNet.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.080]   It's great to have you today, Jane.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.080]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080]   Not Jane.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.080]   Your name is not Jane.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   It's Dane.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.040]   I've been a Sonic customer for years.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.160]   We use Sonic here in the Brickhouse along with Comcast.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.880]   You consistently get great report cards from people like Google on your privacy rules,
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.360]   EFF and others who said that SonicNet is one of the few internet service providers who
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.640]   just doesn't cooperate with the government.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.880]   As far as I know, you're the only ISP to step forward and say, "We support Title 2."
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   Just a bit.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.240]   I have a feeling I'm guessing, Brett, that Title 2 is probably not something high on your
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.800]   list of good things.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.000]   Leo, that's correct.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.120]   It would, especially for a small ISP like me, Dane's ISP is much bigger.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.960]   It would involve just an insurmountable amount of red tape.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.520]   There are more than 3,000 small ISPs in the country, and most of us could not afford the
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.680]   regulatory burden.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.600]   There are also problems which I'll get into as we get into the discussion.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.600]   Great.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.720]   I think before we get into that, and by the way, this isn't a debate exactly.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.400]   I don't want a lot of heat.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.160]   I want more light.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.400]   The whole idea of this is for us to hear.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.160]   And frankly, I'm on the fence to hear what the pros and cons are.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.360]   I feel pretty confident that we need to do something to protect an open internet.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.880]   I don't feel like the really big ISPs like Comcast care, particularly, about an open
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.880]   and free internet.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:42.200]   I really feel like the future of the nation, of our democracy, of how we live depends on
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   an open internet.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.680]   I feel like it's almost maybe a human right.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.800]   But I'm not sure, and I think probably a lot of you at home feel the same way, about
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.440]   what the right way would be to protect this and preserve it.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.240]   I'm actually, I am sure, the right way to do it would be to have true competition and
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.480]   have, if everybody in this country had 12 ISPs to choose from, you could pretty much
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.440]   guarantee at least one or two of them would offer an open internet solution, and that
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.640]   would be the one you would choose.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.600]   But unfortunately, about 80% of the people in this country have, at best, two choices,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.680]   your phone company and your cable company, and both of them seem to be colluding against
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   an open internet.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   That's what we're going to talk about.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.400]   But before we get into this, again, I hope this will be a chance for us to learn something.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.160]   If you're in the chatroom watching live, I will make sure that we include your thoughts
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.040]   and comments as well for Dane and Brett and Mike and Miriam, I'd encourage you also to
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   participate.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   Absolutely.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   But again, I don't want us to descend into a shouting match, which sometimes does happen.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.640]   I think when we get into this, this is one of those hot button topics that people are
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.400]   very, very passionate about.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.320]   But we've bought two of the smartest guys in here to talk about this.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.000]   So I think we can do a good job of it.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.480]   Before we get into it, though, let's talk a little bit about Audible.com, just a quick
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.640]   mention of one of our favorite sponsors, a longtime sponsor of all of our shows.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:04.760]   Audible is the best audiobook store in the world, 150,000 titles.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.600]   All the latest books come out on Audible now.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.480]   It used to be you'd kind of have to wait to get an audiobook of a bestseller.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.160]   But the new Stephen King, which just came out revival, was available day and date as an
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   audiobook as well.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.320]   But that's how I listen to books now at Audible.com.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.800]   We're going to arrange for you to get two books free.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.440]   So I'm going to give you a little help because that's one of the things that's challenging
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:30.960]   with 150,000 titles, an incredible list of science fiction, of technology books like the
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:38.000]   latest from Walter Isaacson, the innovators of business books, of course fiction and nonfiction
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   too.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.480]   I love Audible.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.880]   I listen to Audible all the time.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.040]   I listen to it when I go to bed.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   I listen to it in the car.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.160]   I listen to it at the gym.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.920]   I listen to it when I'm doing dishes, walking the dog.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.800]   We were cooking last night and Lisa was listening to Gone Girl on Audible.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.760]   We love our Audible books.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.280]   If you'd like to get to, here's the deal.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.360]   Go to Audible.com/twit2.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.960]   You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.280]   That's two books.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.960]   Oh, this is interesting.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.320]   Mark Owens' book is out now.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.200]   No hero, the evolution of a Navy Seal.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.960]   This is the guy who claims to be the guy who fired the bullet that killed Osama bin
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.960]   Lawton.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.520]   There's some really good books on here about history.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.560]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.840]   Your first 30 days are free.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840]   There's Gone Girl.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.720]   If you haven't seen the movie yet or even if you have, wow, what a book.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.720]   What a story.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.840]   They do this nicely because Gone Girl has two narrators.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   This is one of the things Audible does so well.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.280]   A woman narrates the woman's Amy's point of view.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.800]   The man narrates the next point of view.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.960]   So you really get that, he said, she said, feeling of the book in the narration too,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.120]   which is very nicely done.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.200]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.360]   And what you'll be doing is signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.400]   That's two books a month free, plus the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal of the New
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.800]   York Times.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   But that first month is free.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.320]   Cancel anytime in the first 30 days.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.920]   You'll get to keep the book forever.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   And I think that's a great deal.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.920]   So give it a try today.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.320]   I just got the new Peter F. Hamilton.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.440]   I'm a big fan of his science fiction.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   Some great sci-fi.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.040]   One of the things Audible is doing is great with Audible Frontiers is they're recording
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.800]   finally for the first time science fiction classics from Asimov and Heinlein.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.560]   They were never audio.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.840]   So that's a Philip K. Dick.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:25.680]   So that's a really great chance to hear some brilliant sci-fi, some classics.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.480]   And then there's Samuel L. Jackson, go to the F to sleep.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:36.840]   So you pick and listen and enjoy Audible.com/twit2.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.920]   You know, we have mentioned before the Brian Cranston narration.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.200]   If you go to Audible.com, this is actually a forgotten mention.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.400]   This is a special deal.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:53.760]   If you go to Audible.com/Cranston, Brian Cranston, of course, what's my name?
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:00.000]   The star of Breaking Bad, the dad and Malcolm in the middle.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.080]   He narrates an incredibly funny book by Adam Mon's back.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.240]   You have to effing eat.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.720]   Right now, whether you're an existing Audible or customer or not, this is free.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.680]   Through November 26th, Andrew Mansback, you have to eff and eat by Brian Cranston, not
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.320]   for kids, but the book does cover what many parents feel at mealtime, but don't say out
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   loud.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.960]   It's an hilarious book and it's absolutely free at Audible through November 26th.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.960]   Don't delay.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.960]   Audible.com/Cranston.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.680]   There is no trial offer.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.080]   This is if you're a customer or not, just download it.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.080]   It's only four minutes.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:45.240]   By the way, if you love it, go to Audible.com/Twit2 and you've got a fabulous entertaining.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.760]   If Title II was enforced, would you have to bleep that, Leo?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.040]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.600]   I was talking on a radio show, I'm starting to get it this week, and radio people have
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.160]   no love for the FCC.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.840]   They hate the FCC.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.520]   If I say a bad word on the radio, I could not only could the station be sued, the network
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.880]   be sued, but I could be sued and we could all be out of work.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.920]   Just look at the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.440]   Not only did that cost the network, it cost all the individual stations a lot of money.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.600]   People are very afraid of the FCC, especially in radio.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   They don't like FCC.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.320]   Well, and to tie that back, until the neutrality proceeding and the 3.9 million comments on
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:29.120]   that, Janet Jackson's nipple slip was the most complimented, most complained about it.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.440]   The FCC does have an interesting dual role there.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.880]   One thing that we could acknowledge right up front.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.240]   So the FCC is run by Tom Wheeler, who is a longtime lobbyist for both the cable and
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.280]   the wireless industries.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.880]   He replaced Julius Jannikowski, who was an Obama crony, would be one word.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.440]   Jannikowski, when he was chairman of the FCC, proposed open internet rules.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.400]   Those rules, Verizon sued and won in court.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:04.320]   The court said you don't have the portfolio.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:10.920]   The Congress hasn't given you the power to regulate, to promulgate these regulations.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.800]   But the court did say there is a path, there is a way.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.680]   It seemed to me that the court, if you read the opinion of the court, very much believed
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.880]   in the idea of net neutrality, of an open internet, but they were compelled by law to say you
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.560]   don't have congressional authority to do that.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.360]   And they said, however, we do think it's important and you ought to consider Title II of the
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.520]   Telecommunications Act.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.880]   So let me start with you, Brett.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.920]   First of all, do you support an open internet?
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.880]   I do support an open internet for some value of the term.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.160]   One of the problems with net neutrality and then also the term open internet is that
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.360]   these are buzzwords that aren't very clearly defined.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:04.160]   They vaguely smack of some kind of fairness that might be enforced by government, but
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.200]   fairness is in the eye of the beholder.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.000]   And the regulations that claim to be open internet regulations that were passed in 2010
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.840]   were anything but fair in a lot of ways.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.280]   In any case, what people tend to do, though, is they tend to claim that internet providers,
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.000]   including me and Dane, and certainly the cable and telephone companies, are somehow
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.200]   evil and must be regulated.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.640]   And it's somehow the internet will close up shop or somehow be restricted if that doesn't
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   happen.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.600]   That tends to be the argument and the reason for concern, the reason why people are considering
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.880]   Title II.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.480]   Now, unfortunately, it's unclear as Leo as you began to mention whether, in fact, Title
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.680]   II would be any better.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:55.200]   A former FCC commissioner by the name of Michael Cops, who is no longer a commissioner but
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   was until very recently, was talking about applying Title II to the internet.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.240]   And he was an advocate of it because he said, "We need to have a national discussion about
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.000]   applying public interest and decency standards to the internet."
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Yeah, that's scary.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.960]   "Cops was interested in applying Title II, but the reason why was that he thought he might
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.280]   be able to censor the net if that were done."
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.320]   Well, he's gone.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:27.160]   Let me, you're right, we should set the table here and say what neutrality is.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.640]   And I propose, and I don't know, can we all agree that net neutrality is treating all
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.480]   bits on the internet equally.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:44.520]   So an internet service provider, a government should not discriminate against any bit particularly,
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:50.360]   if all internet content should be delivered equally to the end user without censorship
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   or discrimination.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   Is that fair?
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   You can agree?
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.240]   Brett's making some noise.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.440]   Dane, was that relatively good?
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.760]   Yeah, I think that's a good definition.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   Mike Masnick?
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:09.440]   For the most part, there's a couple of bits that are tricky in there, where there are
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:16.520]   certainly situations where you could see where something like allowing video generally faster
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.800]   than things that may take longer that don't matter.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   And that's where the--
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.320]   You're talking quality of service or QOX?
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.760]   Quality of service, right.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.640]   So what you want to do is make sure that you don't swallow up quality of service in the
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.600]   definition that you're presenting.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   Right.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.920]   And would you agree to that, Brett, so we all have a place to come from on this?
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.640]   Well, there's many different kinds of equality.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.880]   There is the equality of bits versus the equality of people.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:56.600]   And I honestly think that when people advocate whatever they define as net neutrality, and
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.200]   again, there are many different definitions, they're not really talking about all bits
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.760]   being created people.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:07.240]   They really care more about users and people who want to do things with the internet being
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   created equal.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.520]   And that may actually mean treating the bits unequally.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.720]   The very first internet routers, which were called fuzzballs, were created for NSFnet,
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.160]   which is a predecessor of the internet, actually intentionally treated bits unequally so that
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.560]   they could treat the users more fairly.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:30.440]   They basically delayed long file transfers, which might hug the net, so that people's interactive
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.920]   sessions when they were using a computer remotely would work better.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:41.320]   So I would agree that we're talking about a concept of fairness here, but I don't think
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.520]   it necessarily means treating bits fairly as much as people.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.080]   That seems like a fair cot of silt to add to that.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.560]   Turns out, according to Wikipedia, the term net neutrality came from Tim Wu, who's the
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:19:01.040]   author of the Kill Switch, he's a professor of law or media law at Columbia, and in 2003,
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:07.680]   he actually considered this an extension of a longstanding concept, the common carrier.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.600]   And that's where Title II kind of comes into this.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:17.880]   The idea being that the phone company isn't concerned with what voice traffic goes over
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.320]   it, but is responsible for making sure it's delivered in a timely and effective fashion.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.880]   And I think the notion of the Telecommunications Act is that, at least for Title II, is that
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.280]   if internet service providers are treated that way as common carriers, then they would
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.040]   treat bits in the same way that a phone company would treat voice.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.440]   Is that seems sensible?
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:47.360]   Is that a common carriage is an applicable concept anytime you have a limited number
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.600]   of ways to get from point A to point B.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:58.160]   And so in the olden days, that might be a party running a ferry across a river at a point.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.840]   How do you get your goods from one side to the other?
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.640]   They're literally carrying good goods.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.880]   Yeah, so the common carriage, this goes back hundreds of years.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:12.640]   And the idea is that you would treat all of the traffic equally.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   And it's essential in an environment where consumers have limited choices.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:23.400]   So think about a railroad line, and you've got a farm and you need to get your product
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.080]   to market before it spoils.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.200]   But the railroad lines, there's only one railroad line.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.000]   It's important that that railroad line be regulated.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.200]   Otherwise, they will.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.360]   I mean, it's natural capitalism.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.800]   Abuses their position and charges you more than they should.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.920]   Yeah, they're not acting evil either, acting to maximize profit.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.080]   Yeah, it's capitalism at its best.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   Well, you're a capitalist.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   You want to make money with Sonic.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.720]   Yeah, of course.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.280]   Why is it that you embraced this idea of being treated as a common carrier?
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.360]   So we've been in business for 20 years.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.000]   We've had a lot of success and the company's growing.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   We're hiring, Maryam.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Let's talk.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.280]   Actually, Jane would be a great person to work for.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.040]   Yeah, we're about 200 employees now and growing quickly.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:13.160]   We've had a lot of success that success, I thank the internet for that success.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.120]   I mean, what we sell isn't that interesting.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.680]   It's a connection from A to B. We're a common carrier effectively.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.880]   What people want is to get to the internet, this wonderful thing.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.080]   So all of our success has been driven by the wonderful thing that is the internet, the
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   fact that people want to watch your show or people want to watch YouTube or Netflix
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.560]   or play games online or whatever it is that's their area of interest.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:43.000]   So I think the risk is in an environment where a limited number of carriers in most markets,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.800]   one or two or three, have all the customers, have recognized their market power over those
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:55.040]   eyeballs and are now using their control over those consumptive end users to lever payments
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.960]   out of large sources of content, that puts the internet as a whole at substantial risk.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:09.200]   And so while it might be aspirational for me to get big and become powerful enough to
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:15.600]   abuse my customers and then demand tribute from Netflix to carry their traffic, I think
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.400]   fundamentally our success as internet service providers is based on this wonderful thing,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.720]   the internet and that is at risk when large carriers are mistreating consumers to exact
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   payments.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.440]   Now you're in a different kind of situation, Brett, because as a wireless internet service
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:39.160]   provider, and we've talked about this before, carrying Netflix to your customers is a costly
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.160]   thing for you.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.680]   Indeed it is.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:50.040]   But the main thing though, if you get back to the topic of common carriage for a bit,
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.200]   is that this is not the origin of the internet.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:00.080]   The internet was designed exactly to be the antithesis of common carriage.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.040]   It's basically what the internet is and it still is and what it started as, is as a
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:12.560]   loose federation of people who owned networks, who tied them together willingly and agreed
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.240]   to pass traffic to one another and these are private networks, they built them themselves,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.600]   they had control of them and it was because they agreed to pass the traffic using the
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:27.240]   common internet working protocols that you had a network.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.800]   It wasn't because they were obliged to.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.640]   If you take a look at Title II and you start reading right at the beginning of Title II,
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:41.120]   it talks about common carrier obligations and just the complete opposite of people doing
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.280]   things willingly.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.680]   It says it shall be the duty of every common carrier engaged in industry, foreign communication
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:53.280]   by wire radio to furnish communication service upon reasonable request therefore and accordance
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.480]   with the orders of the commission.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.600]   So right away it talks about being required to serve people, not having the choice of
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.640]   who you serve and then being regulated in every way about how you do it.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:12.080]   One of the things the president said in the FCC I think kind of backed is that they didn't
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:18.560]   have to enforce it 100% that they could pick and choose which portions of Title II that
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:25.800]   they would enforce and they wouldn't in fact enforce things like absolute access or rate
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.400]   protection, things like that.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.520]   I guess some of this comes down to do you trust, would you trust the FCC?
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.320]   Not to take over those powers.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.040]   And I think a lot of some of this conversation really comes down to whether you trust the
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.200]   government or not.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.240]   And I understand the reluctance of people to say, well, we need the government regulation
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.960]   to protect the internet.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.400]   Even my friends at the EFF, John Perry Barlow, has said, yeah, we kind of divided over this
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.800]   because on the one hand we all wish to have a free and open internet but it seems to be
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.400]   maybe that the government's the last person you should ask to preserve that.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   Is that how you feel, Brett?
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.000]   Well, I guess I'm in great sympathy with that.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.240]   It's only EFF originally was founded as a cyber libertarian organization.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.000]   I was actually involved in bringing the people together who founded it.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.720]   I was one of the organizers of the conference where they all met and made a point of introducing
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.200]   them to one another.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   Thank you.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:28.880]   But now they've turned around and made a 180 degree shift and they are now advocating
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:34.920]   Title II and even some of the founders like Barlow are unsure what to think about this.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:41.560]   Myself, I would be very worried about expecting any regulator to willingly forbear from any
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:48.560]   authority that they might have, any leverage that might give them power or influence.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.320]   Title II is huge.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   I have a list here.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:26:00.720]   It contains 16 rule parts, 111 sub parts, 682 pages, 987 rule sections and more than 1,000
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.200]   sub subsections, not counting all the case law that goes along with that.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.360]   This is huge and they're talking about forbearing from particular parts of it, essentially taking
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.760]   this law and cutting it up like a ransom note and only taking certain clauses, certain
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.880]   sections, certain paragraphs.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.640]   This is not the way to do things.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.240]   You don't want to take a law which was written.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.560]   This is the Telecommunication Act of 1934.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.920]   It was written for 19th century telephone companies and tried to cut it up and make it
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   work.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.600]   What you really want to have is a legislative process where Congress goes ahead and makes
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.560]   a law which is appropriate rather than taking a law which is completely inappropriate for
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.920]   the net and trying somehow to pass it together to do something it was never intended to do.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   Does that scare you, Dane?
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.080]   I mean, this is your business.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.440]   They could require all sorts of things.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.440]   It would be very difficult.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.440]   It would be hard for you to do.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:00.640]   I think that the more substantial risk is to the internet and web properties, particularly
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:08.960]   new innovative web properties, if there isn't some regulation around what carriers who dominate
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.000]   the marketplace can do to that traffic.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.240]   I see the threat to the internet as the top priority and Brett talks about an insurmountable
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.000]   about of red tape.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.600]   Today internet service writers are required to publish for the FCC a disclosure of traffic
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.320]   management practices.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   We publish a disclosure.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.080]   I think it says we don't touch your bits.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080]   We don't modify.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   We don't filter.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.240]   We don't engage in deep packet inspection.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:46.960]   I think from a compliance perspective, if the assumption is that Title II will be by and
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.080]   large gutted or rather, they engage in forbearance of all provisions and then begin to re-enable
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.120]   provisions that allow them to assure that traffic is treated equally, my expectation
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.720]   is those of us who treat traffic equally will have a pretty light regulatory burden.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.160]   These are the bright line rules that the president suggested.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   They're just four of them.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.880]   No blocking.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.440]   If a customer requests access to a website or service and the content is legal, an ISP
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.240]   should not be permitted to block it.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.560]   No throttling nor should an ISP be able to intentionally slow down some content or speed
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.920]   up others.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:30.160]   Increased transparency, that's what you were talking about, letting consumers know about
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.920]   what happens at the last mile, things like filtering and throttling and no paid prioritization.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.880]   That seems to be the hot button.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:45.040]   No service should be stuck in a slow lane because it doesn't pay a fee.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:51.280]   Those four rules seem like that's the minimum we would want.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:57.720]   Yeah, and the challenge is if you own a network that has, say, more than half of the consumers
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:04.960]   in a given geography connected to it, you'd like to engage in paid prioritization and
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.560]   you wouldn't want transparency around that and you would engage in throttling because
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.520]   you want to maximize the infrastructure investment that you've made.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.840]   You'd like to squeeze as much out of that asset as you can.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.600]   Well, and there's other specters too, the anti-competitive spectrum.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.520]   Comcast is in every business.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.040]   They're a television network.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   They make movies.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.200]   They do telephone service.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.760]   They do security service.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:33.600]   In every case, these are services that have competition that comes in over the internet.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.240]   I'd be very afraid of a company like Comcast protecting its business interests and throttling
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.960]   net traffic.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.480]   Brett, could you agree to those four premises?
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.520]   No blocking, no throttling, increased transparency, no paid prioritization?
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.800]   I would agree to some of them under some circumstances.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.600]   However, if you believe that those, let's just, for the sake of argument, you believe
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.160]   that those four things are important and they're what the law ought to say.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.760]   And the last thing that you want is Title II.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.120]   Because Title II provides for pay prioritization and provides for discrimination.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:16.440]   I'll read you just a little bit more from Title II, which I have in front of me because
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.520]   most people are advocating Title II without knowing what it says.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.880]   It says, "Communications by wire radio subject to this chapter may be classified in today,
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:30.400]   night, repeated, unrepeated, letter, commercial, press, government, and such other classes
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.560]   as a commission may decide to be just and reasonable and different charges may be made
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.000]   for the different classes of communications."
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.520]   That's specifically paid prioritization.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.520]   Exactly.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.840]   It actually authorizes paid prioritization and this is not one of the sections.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.960]   This is still at the beginning.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.560]   It's still in a section that you really can't forbear from without losing all of the definitions
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.920]   of what the rest of the title means.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.800]   So it actually says that.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:05.560]   As for transparency, the court said that the FCC had the authority to ask for a disclosure
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:11.320]   statement, a traffic management statement, without resorting to Title II.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.760]   It said that the FCC could do that under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.600]   So it doesn't need Title II authority for that.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:26.120]   Now as for- But if that's the case, why would Comcast and Verizon not want Title II?
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.800]   Seems like this gives them permission.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:34.400]   Well, I think they don't want Title II because of the incredible amount of potential red tape.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.800]   Even Google doesn't want Title II.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.200]   Google deployed, as you know, Google deployed fiber in places like Kansas City.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:47.120]   And Google fiber, it includes television, but it does not include telephone service.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.280]   And Google has said that the reason why they did not include telephone service in Google
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:57.880]   fiber was because it would have subjected them to an insurmountable amount of tape, red tape,
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.800]   because of Title II.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   And this is Google.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.600]   This is a company that I would afford to do it.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.360]   Google though is not clear in its message because of course they're also paying a lobbying
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.720]   firm that is lobbying for Title II regulation.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   They're both Google and Facebook.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.240]   Of everyone else, but not of themselves.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.680]   Ah, well, all right.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.680]   Go ahead, Mike.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680]   You were about to say something.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:25.480]   So the thing with the paid prioritization in Title II is that what's pretty clear is
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:32.840]   that what the FCC could do is basically say that paid prioritization is considered unreasonable
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.000]   under Title II.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.320]   And therefore, it is effectively blocked.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.960]   Even though, you know, the way Brett reads it and the way people who are opposed to Title
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.920]   II read it, they pretend that it says you can't do paid prioritization under Title II
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   or that you can do paid prioritization under Title II, but that's not really accurate.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.400]   So as long as the FCC makes it clear that they consider paid prioritization to be de facto
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.960]   unreasonable, then it can block Title II.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.760]   Would it be better if Congress just wrote some rules that were specifically about the
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.600]   Internet, talked about these four bright line principles?
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.560]   Wouldn't that be the best solution?
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.360]   Well, I guess it's not going to happen.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:20.400]   But it's the last time Congress actually did what you thought they should do.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   You're absolutely right.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:27.440]   Like the absolute best solution here is absolutely to have Congress fix it, but does anyone agree
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.440]   on that?
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.040]   Well, I bet Brett doesn't.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   Is that unanimous?
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.840]   That the best thing to do is to, you know, is to write something sensible from scratch
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.640]   for the Internet, the ideal thing?
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.720]   Well, what would be your ideal solution?
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:48.680]   My ideal solution would be actually one which is sort of embodied in the mantra of FCC Chairman
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.600]   Tom Wheeler, which is competition, competition, competition.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:59.680]   The ideal thing would be to eliminate the need for any regulation, even considering any
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.360]   regulation, by stimulating competition among broadband providers.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.120]   In my small town, I guess we're lucky.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.920]   We only have a population of about 28,000 people.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:15.960]   We have 12 broadband providers serving our town, which is tremendously good.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.560]   A lot of people are under the impression that they only have one or two, but they actually
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   have more.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.800]   They're actually smaller providers like me, but the public either doesn't know about them
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.320]   or doesn't consider them because they think you have to be big to be a good Internet provider,
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.480]   which I think a lot of small companies like mine are country examples.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.080]   In any case, if we lower the barrier to entry and there are even more of us, more than the
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:45.920]   3,000 competitive ISPs like me who already exist, nobody would, nobody, I think, even
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.520]   the people who are the most ardent advocates of regulation now would be advocating it because
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.640]   they would recognize that if you didn't like what a provider was doing, you could just switch.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.200]   Unfortunately, the FCC hasn't enabled competition.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.240]   In fact, it has failed to do a lot of things which it said it would do in the National
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.200]   Broadband Plan in order to enable competition.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:15.440]   It hasn't acted on certain things like special access, which is the access to the rented
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.560]   connections that an Internet provider needs to get to the backbone.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.920]   It hasn't made poll attachments easy so that it's not easy for an ISP to put wires up on
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.920]   the polls.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.480]   There are a lot of things that it could do instead of pursuing this entire thing that
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.840]   would actually make more sense.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.440]   I think ultimately it would be the best for everybody.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.880]   Wheeler himself acknowledges that there isn't any competition right now.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:43.680]   He says 80% of America, this is Wheeler, 80% of American homes can only get high speed
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.880]   Internet, 25 megabits are better from one provider.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.800]   He says at 25 megabits there is simply no competitive choice for most Americans.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:57.560]   Three quarters of American homes have no competitive choice for high speed Internet and then there
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.280]   is 20% of them with no service at all.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.240]   And even Wheeler himself says competition doesn't exist.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   I think your response.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.760]   This is something that Brett and I agree on it.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:15.320]   If there was broadly available and really effective competitive access and if consumers
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:21.760]   not only had 12 choices but were actively choosing from those 12 choices, then we wouldn't be
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.800]   having a discussion about neutrality because you wouldn't have a provider controlling the
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.760]   vast majority behaving the way that Comcast and Verizon others are.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.720]   I mean it's hard to switch for one thing.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.680]   I would just call Comcast and try to switch to another provider.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:45.160]   Ask our friend Veronica Belmont and Ryan Block how hard that was.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.600]   I think we're kind of perhaps going at this the wrong angle in a way.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:56.080]   I think we need to look at what consumers want and what the product is that they want
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.960]   and go backwards from there into regulatory.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:05.360]   I have a strong stance on all of this and a lot of it is based on wireless and not wired
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.520]   because I mean we're talking for us premier about ISPs and I realize some of the ISPs
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.600]   are wireless and some of them in San Francisco are wireless like monkey brains.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   But I'm talking about self-thought.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   You're talking about self-thought.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.760]   Ultimately we need to get most of the population.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.160]   Okay, let's remind.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.640]   I think the internet is a human right.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.640]   So if you start with that.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   I agree with you.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.120]   That everybody should have water, food, shelter, healthcare.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.920]   I'm a big pro-polar universal healthcare.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.120]   I'm Canadian so that's probably where I'm coming from.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.640]   And the ability to communicate.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.920]   Right and so the ability to communicate has become critical.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.680]   So that's why I think the internet is human right.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.720]   If you look at it that way then we need to get everyone on the internet in some way.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.280]   And I had to say that but the most efficient way to do that right now is wirelessly.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.880]   Frankly, I think there's another solution which is to get local and region.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.240]   You probably wouldn't like this thing.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.880]   Maybe you would to get local and regional governments to use their power of eminent domain to take
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:07.000]   over infrastructure to run the infrastructure like you run the power company or you run
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.160]   the water company and then let companies like Sonic ride on top of it.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.120]   And then we could get many companies competing with it for internet service.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.920]   Is that unreasonable, undoable?
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.320]   That's Bob Frankston's plan.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.000]   And that's the socialism approach.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.640]   And we see that in Europe in some locations.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.680]   The network in Stockholm is a good example of that.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:37.720]   I don't think that that comports well with the US viewpoint on capitalism.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:45.920]   But let me go back to Miriam's point about internet access as a human right.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.200]   And Brett, you talked about Netflix costs you a lot to deliver.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.280]   Netflix is part of the internet.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:59.560]   I think if you're selling the internet as a service, you should provide as much of it
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.240]   as consumers want or you should create tiers or limits.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:11.920]   I'm not against the idea of you're buying X gigabytes per month or you're buying Y speed.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.000]   Although we don't do either of those things.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   We unlimited and we provide a single tier.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.720]   But if a service writer has costs and they can reflect those costs in the product, I think
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.560]   that's reasonable to do.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.640]   That's something we've talked about, Brett, because I know Netflix costs you a lot of
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.360]   money and you would like to pass that cost along to consumers.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.800]   And it'd be reasonable for him to do so.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.440]   I think he needs to charge people more.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.360]   Especially because he's a wireless provider and there's real issues.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.000]   And then the competition and his terms.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.440]   If he says, I'm selling internet and it's $50, that needs to be the whole internet.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:51.640]   And if he needs to limit people's total consumption, then that's a service package perhaps.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.360]   But I think it's unreasonable to say, "Well, we're going to engage in some management.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.800]   We're going to slow down the Netflix."
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.680]   And I see wireless ISPs are doing this all the time.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.640]   Where they're slowing down services like Netflix.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   Brett, you've said that your customers-
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   And they still call it internet.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   Right.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.240]   You said your customers are price sensitive and you can't very well say to them, "Well,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.080]   it's going to cost you $50 more if you want Netflix."
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.080]   We don't do that.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.360]   We don't discriminate in particular for or against any source of content, including
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   Netflix.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.520]   However, the fact of the matter is that Netflix is a bandwidth hug.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:30.200]   As a matter of fact, it has a particularly insidious property in that no matter how much
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.760]   bandwidth you have, it tries to take that and it tries to take more.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.240]   And if it can't get more, sometimes it buffers on you.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.960]   And the more there is, the better it looks.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.520]   And that's what your consumers-
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.520]   Why?
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   And users want.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.520]   So they want.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.320]   And you can watch the video on the internet.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:49.440]   And when you sell them a subscription to the internet, that's what they should get.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.440]   Right.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.280]   I don't want to misquote you, so correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.920]   But my impression when we talk with Steve Gibson is you would like to go to Netflix and
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:02.280]   say, "Hey, if you want to get to my customers, you need to pay me for the extra cost because
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.400]   you're such a burden on my network because you can't go to customers and tell them that.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400]   Is that accurate?
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   Yes.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.720]   You see, this is exactly the point.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:16.840]   You see, customers do expect, and reasonably so, that when they buy a connection from me,
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.920]   they're buying a connection to the whole internet and they should be able to do anything they
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.440]   want with the internet.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.440]   They want to go to Netflix and buy something and they don't know that Netflix imposes a
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.920]   huge burden compared to their web browsing or something else that they do.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.520]   My opinion is that the correct answer to this is what Tom Wheeler started talking about
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:40.680]   and was lambasted for talking about, which is called two-sided markets.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.800]   What happens is you buy your internet connection, which is a good basic internet connection for
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:50.200]   doing the usual things, and then if you go and you buy a really intense ban with hugging
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:56.320]   service, what happens is some of the money that you pay for that service when you subscribe
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:01.960]   to it comes back around through the provider of that service to buy an extra ban with so
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.880]   that you can actually receive it.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.640]   What Netflix does, unfortunately, is it just says, "Oh, well, ISP.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.080]   You should get no additional money for this additional use of capacity.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:18.040]   Instead, you should just allow your users who don't subscribe to Netflix to cross subsidize
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.520]   the ones who do."
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:26.440]   That's not fair because it raises prices for the people who are not subscribing to Netflix
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:31.200]   and is leaving money in Netflix's pocket when it should be really should be helping the
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.120]   pay for this extra capacity.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.280]   Fundamentally, turning the internet into a two-sided market breaks the internet.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:44.640]   That is if what you're selling is access to the internet and you want to limit the speed
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.880]   or the total consumption, those are reasonable things to do, you build a transparent service
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.280]   package out of that.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.920]   But if you're going to not let people get to content unless content pays you, what does
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.280]   that do to innovation?
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.480]   What does that do to startups?
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.080]   What does that do to the internet as a whole?
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.080]   Oh, we're not going to do it.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.080]   We're not limiting.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:09.080]   This is taking a market power position, particularly where...
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.600]   Hold on, Brad, because we'll give you a chance.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.960]   This is taking a market power position, particularly amongst infrastructure service writers who
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:22.320]   control the last mile, who own the wires to the premises and giving them unlimited power
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.160]   to do anything they want.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.080]   That will break the internet fundamentally.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   Brad?
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.080]   I think...
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.080]   Let's break it.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.080]   Okay.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:34.040]   I'm sorry, but I've got to take issue with that statement.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:39.560]   People aren't paying me for an unlimited connection to the internet with unlimited resources.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.760]   BAMWITH, where I am located, is extremely expensive.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   Well, then you should limit the money.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:50.560]   It can cost as much as $20 per megabit per second per month in BAMWITH for me to provide
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.440]   people with service.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.400]   Someone has to pay that bill.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.360]   Your customer should pay that bill.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.400]   And it'd be nice if the customer went ahead and was willing to pay that bill, but they
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.600]   don't understand.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   The customer doesn't understand Netflix takes this much BAMWITH versus say YouTube taking
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.080]   this much BAMWITH or whatever.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   I mean, they don't need to understand.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   They also like just...
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.080]   It's ex-cores per month.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.680]   They like their charges to be predictable, and they don't like overage charges.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   We don't charge any.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.400]   We don't have any data caps.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.320]   And they really expect, according to what they subscribe to, they expect the money that
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.080]   they pay for each of these things to cover it all.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:37.000]   When the customer subscribes to Netflix, they might need to bump their BAMWITH.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.160]   And the easiest way for that to happen is for them to pay that extra money when they
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.160]   subscribe to Netflix.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:48.320]   That money should be included right there in the bill for the Netflix subscription.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.920]   And then should come back around to the ISP.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.800]   That way, the customer isn't suddenly surprised to find out that the service that they ordered
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.440]   from Netflix exceeds their connection and suddenly, "Oh, I've got to pay more still
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.520]   besides the cost of the Netflix connection in order to stream."
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.720]   It just makes things better to the consumer.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.720]   It's simpler.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.480]   It meets their expectations.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.480]   It really works out better.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:16.520]   And it even works out better for Netflix because their customers are not disappointed.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.520]   They subscribe to Netflix and voila, they're able to stream it.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.240]   Now, again, we have to...
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.400]   We have somehow to recover the cost of the capacity.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:32.440]   It's challenging because a little service provider doesn't have market power over Netflix.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.440]   We don't have market power.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.440]   You can't go to Netflix and say, "But Comcast did.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.240]   Comcast, last year, turned the knob down.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.240]   They didn't buy enough interconnects, but they'd effectively turn the knob down."
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:47.320]   This is a competitive challenge because a service provider like Brett or Sonic, we don't
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:53.480]   have the ability to abuse enough customers to create the leverage to force a payment.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:59.160]   So the only way to create a double-ended market that works for small and large service providers
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.800]   would be to regulate it.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.400]   And Brett's asking for less regulation, but he also seems to be asking for more.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.200]   I'm not asking for regulation.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.520]   I'm asking for markets to do this.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.240]   I'm asking for this to happen because the market wants it.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:21.040]   By the way, as for Leo's brief comment there that Comcast turned the knob on Netflix, there
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:26.920]   is growing evidence that in fact Netflix turned the knob on Comcast as leverage when they
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:30.840]   were in negotiations because people found out this is interesting.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.200]   People who are having trouble with streaming Netflix over their Comcast connections, they
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.920]   went and used something called a VPN.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:44.240]   A VPN is a special piece of software which basically all of your data goes into a tunnel
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.200]   and it comes out in a different place on the internet and it looks like you're out there
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.080]   in a different place on the internet.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:55.120]   They used a VPN over the same Comcast connection and suddenly they were able to stream smoothly.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.800]   Well, you can make the argument that Comcast is doing deep packet inspection and wasn't
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.040]   able to do so on a VPN or the Netflix.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.440]   You can make the argument both ways, Brett.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.240]   I don't think that that's conclusive in either direction.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:11.080]   We're going to take a break because I want to come back and I want to talk about solutions
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:18.200]   because I think we've set out what the issues are and you can see very clearly why people
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.960]   don't want regulation, why people don't want regulation.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.840]   I think this is a very challenging situation and I'd like to hear what you guys as a group
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.200]   think we could do to make this work.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.920]   We can't solve this in an hour but we'll try and we have a few more minutes.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.480]   Our show today brought to you by another company that rides on the internet but so much of
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.480]   the innovation that's happened in this country is because of the internet.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.560]   Go to meeting makes it possible for people to work anywhere and yet work collaborate
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.320]   together, see each other, share screens.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.160]   Nowadays, many businesses are distributed all over the world and really you can thank
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.360]   companies like Go to meeting.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:59.720]   Really Go to meeting because it's one of the most used probably had a lot to do with this.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.680]   You pay once a month, a flat fee, you hold as many meetings as you need as often as you
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.840]   want as long as you want with anyone anywhere.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.920]   You're in a virtual space where you can see their screen.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.240]   They can see your screen turn on the cameras.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:17.240]   You got high def crystal clear, high def video conferencing for a very affordable price.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:22.240]   Travel is ridiculously expensive, time consuming, nobody wants to do that and a phone call may
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.240]   not do it.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.240]   Email may not do it.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.760]   I think the best way to get the work done is to see each other, to see each other's
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.920]   screens, to collaborate together, to present in real time and that's what Go to meeting
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:31.920]   lets you do.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.920]   I want you to try it free right now for 30 days.

[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.200]   I've literally held GoToMeeting sitting out in the backyard and enjoying the beautiful
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   weather.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.440]   No one knows until I turn on the camera and then they see.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.480]   I'm wearing a bathing suit.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.280]   But you don't have to turn on the camera.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.440]   Go toMeeting.com.

[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.440]   Just a great service from Citrix.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.920]   They are great and I think they're an absolutely the best service provider in this particular
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   area.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   Try it today.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.840]   GoToMeeting.com.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   We are.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.840]   This is a great panel.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:17.280]   I just want to thank you guys especially for keeping on an even keel here and really
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.840]   talking about the problem and the solution and the issues for you.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.360]   It's really good to have two internet service providers here.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.680]   Brett Glass, he runs a wireless internet service provider in Laramie, Wyoming.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.640]   It's called...
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.640]   It's called Lariat.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.640]   Lariat.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.400]   As far as we know, we were the world's first wireless internet provider.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.840]   We've been doing this for more than 23 years now.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.240]   What are you using?
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.240]   Is it microwave?
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.920]   How are you?
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   It's classified as either microwave or millimeter wave depending on the link.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:53.520]   Believe it or not, we are actually able to deliver up to 1.25 gigabits of bandwidth if
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.080]   people want it anywhere within our service area.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.720]   We're very lucky to be able to have a good fiber connection and which is fiber and microwave
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.800]   connection back to the internet pack bone that lets us do that.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.240]   When you started this, it was a community network, wasn't it?
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.520]   It wasn't a commercial enterprise.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.520]   That's correct.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:17.360]   We started originally as a cooperative, as a rural telecommunications cooperative because
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.160]   that's what the IRS classified as.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.120]   We operated that way for 10 years.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.920]   Then the members decided they didn't want to keep on meeting and voting.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.840]   They just wanted somebody to provide them with good commercial service and to be able
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.240]   to get investors.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.560]   They went ahead and they allowed my wife and I to take it private, which we did.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:41.960]   Interestingly, our traffic management policies which do involve sometimes shaping traffic
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.920]   were developed by consensus when we were a co-op.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:50.240]   The members actually agreed that certain traffic ought to be prioritized just as it was in
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.640]   the very beginnings of the internet to make things go more smoothly.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:59.480]   Of course, we've killed your homepage as we do every time you're on, lariat.ly.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   Wait till later, l-a-r-i-a-t.net.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   I'll keep trying.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.200]   Well, I got it up here.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.840]   Would you put a lower third in Brett's lower third for the LIRL?
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.120]   We should give Brett a nice plug.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:19.240]   Also here from SonicNet, which is my internet service provider, but also I think many people
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:24.120]   recognize Dane Jasper, the founder and CEO as one of the leaders of independent internet
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.120]   service providers.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.480]   I know you've served on CASP and other, how do you know how to pronounce it?
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   I-S-P.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   I-S-S-P.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.520]   It's so good to have you here.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.520]   I appreciate it.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.680]   SonicNet, you're in how many communities now?
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:43.120]   We're in 125 California cities in greater L.A. in the Bay Area, Sacramento area.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.120]   That's really awesome.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.120]   That's a great message.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.880]   Five million premises today.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.480]   I remember when it was Dane in a closet.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.720]   I'm not saying you've come out of the closet.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.680]   I'm just saying that you were in, never mind.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   Excellent.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.440]   You did it all yourself in the early days.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.400]   That's why Linux is his license plate.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.320]   By the way, Leo, my license plate says Unix.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.320]   Oh, yes.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.160]   And I'm building a Unix server here on the table next to my aunt.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.440]   You guys are P's.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.560]   Dualing license plates, I love it.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.680]   Also here, it's a mirror image.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.760]   We love having Miriam on.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.440]   She gives us a unique perspective, the Quebecois.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.440]   No, no.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.320]   She gives the Quebecois perspective.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.320]   There you go.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.800]   You want single-payer healthcare?
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   Really?
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   Come on.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   I'm always confused.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   French from France.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   Which is also a bunch of socialists.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   You bet.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   Watch out.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   You bet.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.800]   And joining us from Techter, Mike Masnick.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:45.600]   I want to wrap up this section because, and Mike, maybe you can start us off.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.760]   You've been on the forefront of this.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:52.040]   You've been talking about this for years, like literally since 1997.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   Is there a solution?
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:59.720]   Well, I think part of the issue is that it's changed over time.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.960]   The situation has changed over time.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.720]   And I mean earlier, it was mentioned that the EFF has changed their position on net
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   neutrality.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.080]   And I think that's actually true of myself as well.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.280]   A lot of it does go back to whether or not there's real competition in the market.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.160]   What would be happening would be very different if there were real competition.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.640]   So there might be a solution if there were real competition.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:30.360]   In the meantime, without significant competition in most markets, it seems like the best solution.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.240]   I know Brett disagrees.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:37.000]   But from my perspective, in front of perspective of a lot of us, in the interim without the
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.760]   competition, there needs to be something to keep the really large ISPs in place from
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.960]   abusing their market power.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   Yes.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   Yes.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.480]   And you know, all you have to do is look at what AT&T did.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.440]   They said, well, if you're going to impose net neutrality rules, we're not going to build
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   anymore fiber.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.360]   They're taking their ball and going home.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.280]   They were never going to build most of that fiber.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.320]   Well, as we said, it was fiber to the press release, right?
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.920]   They announced most of those.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.800]   Every time Google said that, oh, we're doing fiber here, suddenly AT&T, we're doing fiber
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   to our press release.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   We could do that too.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   Verizon did the same thing.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.320]   Verizon started rolling out Fios and then got tired of it and stopped.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   Exactly.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   And that was...
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.320]   The fibers are heavy.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:26.920]   So Verizon used to have some pretty visionary management that really did believe in fiber
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:32.400]   and really believed in it and went on a big install and Wall Street freaked out because
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.400]   they said, how can you do that?
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.640]   That's expensive to put in fiber even if that's what customers want.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.840]   And so as soon as that management was gone and Wall Street kept complaining, suddenly
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.000]   all the fiber deployments dried up.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.480]   Dane Jasper's rolling fiber.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.560]   You got gigabit going out in a number of communities.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.080]   You have it just up the road here piece.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.080]   Yeah, we do.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:56.000]   We're in Sebastopol here in the North Bay and we've got projects underway in the East
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Bay and...
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   It's kind of the...
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.160]   I think Verizon said it was 5,000 subscribers something less.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.640]   It's very expensive.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   It's not that expensive.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   Okay.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   Are you doing fiber to the curb or fiber to the...
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   Fiber to the home.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   Fiber to the home.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.640]   Wow.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.840]   You know, the costs of building it have gotten lower.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.720]   But remember this isn't a market.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.920]   I'm not operating in a market with five dwellings per square mile.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.320]   And bread has some very special needs.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.720]   And you know, backhaul is also a challenge in a very rural market.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:31.040]   And so in each market you have to approach your technical solution differently.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:38.560]   But yeah, we are, you know, our overall vision and I think we all agree that neutrality
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.520]   is an issue because we have a failed competitive market.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.520]   Right.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.520]   Yes.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.040]   And I take some responsibility for that because I'd like to fix that.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.280]   My vision is to solve that.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:56.400]   And so fundamentally what we're building is broadband it up to a gigabit and unlimited
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.040]   phone service for $40 a month.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:04.560]   And so where we only have copper, we deliver that with VDSL2 or ADSL2+ depending upon the
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:09.160]   distance where we have fiber, we deliver that at gigabit over fiber.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:14.320]   And I believe that consumers when presented with a compelling competitive option will
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.960]   move to that product.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:22.240]   And when there are 12 different folks to choose from and consumers actively making those choices,
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.920]   this debate will be moot.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.920]   Right.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.560]   You know, for many of your all of your DSL installations you're riding on top of the
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.520]   copper provided by the incumbent carrier.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.480]   And I published an item this last week that that that reiterates the importance of local
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:44.240]   loop on bundling the 96 Act really visualized a an investment ladder where competitors would
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:51.560]   first deliver over copper, then over build and deliver with their own infrastructure.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.080]   And that's the path that we're walking.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:00.360]   What if the FCC said to the cable companies, "Hey, you got to do the same thing that the
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   phone companies are doing.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.280]   You have to open up your physical plant to other providers."
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.440]   Would that solve it?
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.600]   Or to me, where I build fiber.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.840]   And you know, that's the situation in some other countries.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.440]   Infrastructure providers need to quantify their costs and lease infrastructure at cost
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.760]   plus a defined margin.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:23.160]   And you know, that was really the vision of the 96 Act was to create a vibrantly competitive
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.360]   marketplace.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:29.440]   And you look at, you know, neutrality debate in Europe and the choices that consumers have.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:33.000]   In the UK, you can buy internet from Tesco, the grocery store.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   Right.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   So lots and lots of choices.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.240]   They don't do the infrastructure, but they provide over the top.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.240]   Correct.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.040]   And there are also infrastructure providers like Virgin who provide over cable.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   So a lot more choices, whereas, you know, through the 2000s, you know, Chairman Michael
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:53.560]   Powell, you know, now a cable industry lobbyist, rewound some of the unbundling requirements
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:58.000]   and really kind of kneecapped the 96 Act.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Right.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.720]   And you know, that's, we've ended up with the unfortunate outcome of the regulatory decisions
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:10.480]   that were made during the, you know, Michael Powell era and the Kevin Martin era, which
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.680]   were intended to create a duopoly.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.160]   Now we've ended up with the atoms of a duopoly.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.840]   So today's FCC needs to regulate that for the benefit of consumers.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:25.840]   Now we, entities like Brad and myself, need to work hard to bring more competitive choice.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.720]   And when we're successful at that, this point will become moot.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:35.440]   There is a precedent when the FCC auctioned off the 700 megahertz spectrum, Google bid,
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.960]   but was able to convince the FCC to make some open rules.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:43.400]   They said, you know, whoever buys this should be required to make it open.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.520]   Verizon ended up getting it and Verizon has changed it.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520]   And broke the rules.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:52.160]   And broke the rules has chafed at this, but there is a, there is a precedent for the FCC
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.960]   to mandate, you know, you got to keep this open.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.440]   I'd love to see them open up the cable of physical plant.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   That would make a difference, wouldn't it?
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.040]   It'd make a huge difference.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.440]   And make that a requirement of the time Warner, Comcast.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:06.320]   I mean, we need a philosophy of abundance.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:12.760]   We need to create a broadband access product that where the costs are tied well to the
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:17.920]   cost of infrastructure and router ports and optics, the cost of those infrastructure components
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.240]   are dropping like mad.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:24.680]   And what consumers need to end up with is abundance as a result, not being squeezed
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.880]   and have those assets, you know, exploited.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:29.480]   And I would argue it's the same with wireless.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:35.040]   I think there is this indoctrination going on by all parties and particularly the wireless
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.280]   carriers that there's a lack of spectrum.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.280]   Right.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.240]   But what we really need to do is to have the government free up all the military spectrum
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.400]   that's no longer used, that's all the analog stuff.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.960]   And we could open that up to wireless and not have crazy auctions that cause billions
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.160]   of dollars for it and actually get wireless to everyone at an affordable rate.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.320]   Well, and we had Mark Cooper on the father of the cell phone.
[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:01.280]   One of the things Martin said, one of his big campaigns is digital because spectrum can
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:06.040]   be virtually wireless spectrum can be virtually infinite as long as you're not using analog
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040]   signals.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.200]   We're not really anymore.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.720]   But I mean, and many may.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.520]   But the military is if you look at the spectrum assignments, their spectrum is insane.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.520]   Like to today's standards, you could run five times the amount of traffic we run on
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.680]   our private on our public networks right now on what.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.520]   So I'm not suggesting they leave all that behind.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   They need it.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.240]   But I think there's a lot of it that could be repurposed.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.000]   And I think to me, a progressive government towards, you know, this idea of net neutrality
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.520]   being your human right is to kind of start putting the systems of government in place
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:50.120]   to make that possible and not letting the corporate interests take over and try to manipulate
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   that.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   And I think that's the problem.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.080]   I think that the FCC has full control.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.520]   I think that it's more about trying to find a way because right now we have like two big
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.480]   wireless choices, two big wire choices in most urban areas, right?
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.240]   I mean, we also have Timo will spend on wireless and there do some of them.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.960]   Timo will swing pretty well.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:15.000]   But I think that, you know, if you look at, you know, the big, the big players, this
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.120]   really 18, 18 Verizon wireless and and they're bullies.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.080]   They they lobby the government.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.720]   And they don't they want more spectrum.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720]   Exactly.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.560]   But auctioned at the highest price because they're the ones that can afford to buy it.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:33.760]   And you know, whisper the wireless ISP association has long pushed for more unlicensed spectrum
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.560]   and abundance of unlicensed spectrum, whether it's recaptured from former military use
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.360]   or television white spaces will be great.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.160]   If however, it goes to the highest bidder, exactly, you're back to the Larry it, then
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160]   it's not going to work.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.080]   It's not going to be a Verizon and 18, 18, 18, 18.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.160]   And you know, and is is government going to try and maximize the return for the taxpayer
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.800]   by selling that spectrum to the highest bidder?
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.680]   Or are they going to try and maximize the return to the taxpayer by assuring that you
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.520]   can get connected at a reasonable cost?
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.160]   Brett Glass, what's your solution?
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:15.040]   Well, I guess my my take on it is that competition hasn't failed yet.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.480]   There are, as I mentioned, about 3000 competitive carriers about my size like me who are willing
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.440]   to compete as hard as they can.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.680]   All we need is to be at least not discouraged by the regulatory authorities and we can do
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.020]   great things.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:38.240]   On the other hand, if we take a ready fire aim approach, if we regulate before we try
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.480]   stimulating competition, which by the way is required of the FCC by that same section
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.040]   706, then our only choice is going to be regulated duopoly and I don't think that
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.360]   we'll be as happy with that.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:55.720]   Our company tried different ways to work around the FCC, not facilitating competitions.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.400]   We fought to use the copper infrastructure.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.040]   We fought for what was called dry copper.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.440]   And the telephone company said to us, "Oh sure, yeah, you can go ahead and rent our
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.600]   lines."
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.160]   But then they made the whole sale price of renting the line higher than their price
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.160]   for a complete DSL.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.240]   Sure, Dan's not unfamiliar with that practice either.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240]   Yeah, your dad's.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240]   I'm sure he's not.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   These guys are horrible.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.240]   No, no, I'm trying to participate.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.240]   Go ahead, finish Brett.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.240]   I was just going to say.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   We tried to.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   Go ahead.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.240]   Go ahead.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.720]   It's a little difficult because Brett, unfortunately, is on Skype.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.720]   Next time you've got to fly out from Lariat.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.720]   Be glad to.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.720]   Whether they're as much better than here or as it is.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   Go ahead and finish it.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.200]   I'll give you a chance, Dan, to respond.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.320]   We tried to get into a spectrum auction and it was folly.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.940]   The reason why is that essentially there is so much value to the mobile carriers in foreclosing
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:52.560]   all competition that the spectrum is worth several times as much to them to keep competition
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.240]   out as it is to us.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.640]   We couldn't even break even bidding the prices that they bid.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.320]   And so as a result, we're locked out a spectrum.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.800]   We're locked out a special access, the lease lines.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.240]   We're locked out of the local loops if we want to try to use the copper.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.480]   Basically the FCC has failed to stimulate competition.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.800]   But the good news is that small ISPs like me are scrappy.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.640]   We've managed to bypass all of that anyway by using unlicensed spectrum, by doing other
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:27.800]   creative things to try to make an end run around the fact that we haven't been treated
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   fairly.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:34.200]   If the FCC would only treat us fairly, there would be no need whatsoever for any of these
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.880]   regulations.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.320]   The whole discussion would be moot.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.520]   And so I say competition, competition, competition.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:45.040]   And please let's try it first because if we impose title two first, my company may not
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.320]   be able to stay in business.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320]   Dain.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.920]   Dry copper is achievable.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.720]   It's eminently doable.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.000]   That's how we connect many of our customers today.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.520]   That means they don't have phone service from the incumbent carrier, but they do have
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.840]   internet service from you on top of their copper.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:08.440]   It means that we co-locate in the central office exchange buildings, lease copper to
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.800]   the premise, and put next generation service over that.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:16.640]   So we're delivering POTS Voice as well as VDSL2, pair bonding.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.200]   That's your fusion project.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.400]   So that's a product that we can look at.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.160]   You can see where the phone company is not highly incented to support this.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160]   They're required to.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.240]   It's regulated.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.360]   And I don't know why Brett has had challenges deploying that.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360]   It's a key part of the nine six.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.560]   Our state public service commission, I'll tell you why, is because our state public
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.840]   service commission basically allowed them to discontinue some of the services and to
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.040]   raise the prices so high that it was uneconomic.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.880]   That's illegal.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.000]   And we haven't had those challenges.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.600]   So the challenge I see in what you're trying to accomplish, Brett, in creating a two-sided
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:06:02.240]   market is that that will only work when you're big enough to harm your customers badly enough
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.520]   to extort money from large sources of content.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:10.680]   And it's not plausible that any of us will get big enough to engage in that kind of anti-competitive
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680]   behavior.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.680]   Yep.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.680]   I guess I have to disagree.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:20.320]   And I believe that it's actually a win-win, and the smarter providers of content are going
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.160]   to recognize that.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:28.320]   Netflix might not, but HBO might, or CBS might, as people shift their TV viewing over to
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.280]   streaming, and this is beginning to happen.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.240]   The light bulb is going to go on in somebody's head, and they're going to say, "This is a
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.880]   good idea."
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.440]   And go ahead and pay less for your broadband connection, because then when you stream with
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.600]   us, we'll take care of the cost of the bandwidth.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.560]   People will like that because their overall bill will be lower.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.840]   And so I think ultimately the market forces could correct this problem.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:55.160]   I want to wrap this up because we've gone an hour, and that's more than as much as I
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160]   wanted to do.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.480]   And I don't think we've at all come to a solution, but I think it's become really clear why this
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.760]   is such a challenge, not only for all of us, but for Congress, which barely understands
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.000]   what's going on.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.960]   The courts and the FCC, this is a naughty problem, and yet it's probably one of the most important
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.400]   political decisions that needs to be made in this country today.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.720]   Can we talk about Tom Wheeler being a dingo?
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.560]   Do you eat, baby?
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.440]   No, but I just thought it was the best part of the proposal.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.440]   He is proposed.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.280]   One of the things, Tom Wheeler proposed, which is interesting, is that there be net neutrality
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.560]   for the interconnects, but not for the retail.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.520]   Is that a solution any of you would consider?
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:40.000]   I can volunteer a comment on it.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.600]   Many advocates of net neutrality are up in arms about a practice which is called zero
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.600]   rating.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.600]   You know what that is.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.440]   It's where you don't pay out of your data allocation.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.600]   You basically don't-- you, the consumer, don't pay any money when you're going to certain
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.560]   services because they pick up the tab for the bandwidth.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.960]   Some of the phone companies are doing that right now.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.960]   You get free Beetons music, for instance, on AT&T.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.960]   Exactly.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:09.600]   A lot of the people who are very strong advocates of certain ideas of net neutrality say that
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.800]   that's a bad idea.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.120]   But essentially, what we're talking about when we're talking about regulating the relationship
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:21.040]   with the content providers under Title II is we're talking about zero rating that end.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.560]   Declaring a price of zero for either end isn't really neutral.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.760]   It's not really fair.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:31.560]   What it would require-- it would give me as an ISP an obligation to every single person
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.240]   out there who puts up a web server to give them something for free.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.200]   I don't think that's the right way to go about solving it.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.080]   There may be some other ways, but I don't think that's it.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.080]   You know, it's funny.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.200]   We all know what we want, but it's darn hard to get there.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   Kittens?
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:49.280]   Dane, one final word, I gave Brad a final word.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.960]   What are any final thoughts from you?
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.200]   You know, I'll agree with Brad.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.120]   We need effective competition.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.840]   We've been working hard on that for a lot of years, and we're continuing to fight that
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.320]   fight, and I'm excited about doing that.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.360]   I'm really optimistic about the future and the potential.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.560]   I think neutrality is important because we need to not break the internet in the meanwhile,
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.160]   and not having our competitors enjoying a subsidy.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:22.920]   If a competitor can get a dollar or two or 10 out of sources of content, and I can't
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.720]   because I'm smaller and don't have that market power, that actually threatens competition.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.880]   So this is an important issue.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:33.360]   We need to protect the internet, and if that means regulation, I think it's a reasonable
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   course.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:38.360]   Dane Jasper's founder and CEO of SonicNet, if you're lucky enough to have it in your
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.360]   neck of the woods, you ought to get it because it's a great internet service, and I thank
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.000]   you so much for taking the time.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.760]   I know this is a naughty problem.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.760]   Thanks, Lee.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.760]   Good to see you.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760]   Great to be here, Leo.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.760]   Thank you.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.760]   I really appreciate having you today.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.760]   Thank you.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   I hope it's not too cold.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.760]   It is, but we in Wyoming are used to it.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.760]   Here you go.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.960]   You got the wood stove.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.160]   I hope this has helped a little bit.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:15.240]   We're going to go back to our regular format and talk about the week's tech news with Mike
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240]   Masnick of Tech Dirt.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.040]   So glad you're here, Mike, and Miriam Schwar.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.880]   Great to have you both.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.080]   We're going to reset.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.160]   I'll let you guys reset, and I'll do a Squarespace commercial while we do it.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.200]   Actually, before I do that, let's take a look at what you might have missed this week on
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.200]   Twitter.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.200]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.960]   Oh, give me a sign up.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.960]   Whoa.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.160]   You want to talk about net neutrality?
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.680]   Are you asleep?
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   Triagulation.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.040]   You joke about your kids.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.040]   Do they mind that?
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.760]   They really do, but they know when I die there's an inheritance.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.760]   All about Android.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.880]   Is there a little bit of Nexus entitlement?
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.480]   No, there's a lot of it.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.760]   Is all these other phones getting updates quickly, which is what we've all wanted?
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.760]   Why is that a bad thing?
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760]   All this is.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.920]   Because I have a Nexus phone and I want it now.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.920]   Macbreak Weekly.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.200]   Microsoft, they've announced that they're going to make office for iPad free.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.760]   It seems like an easy decision to say, let's give up a small amount of money with the idea
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.000]   that this is going to pay off big time by making our entire ecosystem a lot more valuable.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   Twit.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.560]   Technology for your eyes and ear holes.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.680]   On this episode of KnowHow Probes, we'll tell you how to put some...
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.400]   You know what?
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.400]   No.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.400]   No.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.400]   Amateur.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.400]   Do second takes.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.560]   You do second takes.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.240]   Coming up this week, if you missed the last narrow and problematic window to preorder one
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.640]   plus one phone in October, you get another chance tomorrow, which is Monday, November
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:43.040]   17th, but only from 8 a.m. Pacific to 9 a.m.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.560]   Plus promises an improved preorder system, and let's hope so.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.600]   Demo fall 2014 begins on Tuesday, November 18th in San Jose, California.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.600]   And also on that same day, Gigome Roadmap starts in San Francisco.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.600]   That's what's coming up this week.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.600]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.600]   Wow.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.600]   This was...
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:07.360]   I wish we could have all said, oh no, this is what we definitely need to do.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.360]   And that's that.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.360]   It's complicated.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.920]   I'm damn complicated.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920]   Anyway...
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.800]   But I think we're all kind of...
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.440]   A lot of us, I think, agree at least that net neutrality is something that needs to happen,
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.440]   how we define that.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.440]   Right.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.440]   Right.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.440]   But right now it's broken, right?
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.120]   And we know we want to preserve the internet.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.480]   I mean, that's clear.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.880]   I think a lot of things that we're said today that I think matter is competition.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.880]   Net neutrality is important.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.880]   We need it.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.400]   And then finally, that the system as we know it today is broken.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.320]   There's too many duopolies.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.320]   Monopolies for people.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.080]   I think a lot of people would say...
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.320]   Most people would say, "What's...
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.320]   Nothing's broken.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.120]   Hey, we're happy I get high speed internet.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.280]   It's working great.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.320]   My Netflix is coming in fine.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.760]   I can use my cell phone pretty much anywhere and...
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.760]   And then they...
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.760]   ...serve the net.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   They see their bill at the end of the month.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.760]   Well, it's expensive.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.760]   But you know what?
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.760]   It's worth it.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.400]   It's worth 60 bucks a month because internet is huge.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.640]   Do you think there's a common feeling in the world, in the United States, that the internet
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   is broken, Mike?
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:18.080]   Well, I think there is a real fear that the big broadband ISPs have too much power.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.560]   And just the fact that you say, "Yeah, Netflix is working now."
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.560]   But you know...
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560]   It wasn't last year.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.640]   For a few months there wasn't really working.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.280]   You know, I mean, that's an interconnect question.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:34.840]   And some people say that's separate from net neutrality, but it's clearly a related thing.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.800]   It's an issue of market power.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.360]   And going back to the John Oliver thing, the Dingo comment was pretty good.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.040]   Now I know where the Dingo came from.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.000]   I get it now, of course John Oliver.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.440]   But the thing that I think was even more important about what he was saying was that what net
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:59.360]   neutrality is really about is stopping the big broadband players from messing with your
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.760]   internet connection.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.960]   And that's really what it comes down to, is that when they have too much market power,
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.320]   it's no longer a free market.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.120]   There isn't competition.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.600]   And so they get away with things.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:15.440]   And they've been very clear for a decade now that this is exactly what they wanted to
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.440]   do.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.400]   They wanted to have the market power to demand extra money, which is really double paying
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.200]   from the big service providers, because effectively they're just jealous.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.200]   Right?
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.400]   I mean, Netflix is super successful.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.880]   Google is super successful.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.200]   And they want some of that cash.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.080]   And so they've figured out ways to try and extract it.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.440]   And that's what this fight is really about.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:43.760]   I do have to say, I just, I feel like it's very easy to do a kind of a reductionist thing.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:51.400]   I think what, look, I loved the John Oliver piece, but ultimately it's a little bit reductionist.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:56.000]   In order to make this a clear choice, you have to reduce the issues a little bit and
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.120]   maybe be a little untrue to the choice.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:01.640]   And that's the problem with, I think what we did, what I tried to do today was not be
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.280]   reductionist, but really give you some of the issues.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.560]   But what happens then is that's very thorny.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.160]   That is a tough one.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:15.640]   And you don't really know, well, is what is, what path do we pursue here?
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:21.160]   And I think people want an easy answer, but I've seen so many, you know, Vihart's incredible
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.360]   illustrations of net neutrality and all that.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.480]   But frankly, they're almost all reductionists.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.240]   They don't really state the problem fully.
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.640]   But I think that's true of all the news out there.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.640]   Well, that's news.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.440]   And you know, in kids John Oliver, it's entertainment anyway, ultimately.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.640]   Yeah, and he does a great job.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.640]   And I thought that was a great piece.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   And it made me go, yeah.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.240]   And you got the trolls going.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.280]   Don't get the trolls going.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:43.280]   It's never worth it.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.680]   Yeah, but I mean, the other issue that's related to that is just the fact that not
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.200]   only is the issue complicated, but the potential solutions or the solutions that are on the
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:57.400]   table, you know, this idea of title two versus section 706, how many people are actually
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.760]   going to sit down and read those?
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.760]   No.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.560]   And it's very, very few.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.480]   And they are complex.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.000]   And you know, it's true.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.120]   Title two is a part of a law that was written in 1934.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.920]   And so, you know, the solutions and the issues are complicated.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:17.320]   And so that makes it actually pretty difficult to really dive in and understand, you know,
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.560]   what it really means for individuals.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.760]   The best thing though, I think that we can do as geeks and everybody who's watching this,
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.840]   you've qualified.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.880]   The best thing we can do as geeks is just let these guys know we're paying attention.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.880]   Yep.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.480]   And that we care.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:42.000]   And I think millions of comments to the FCC, Comcast is a, they're not insensate to all
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   of that.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.520]   And if we say, no, you know what, we want a free and open internet, they're going to
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.680]   moderate their behavior a little bit, whether Congress or the courts or the FCC makes them,
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.880]   they are going to pay attention to their customers.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.480]   And so the key is to stand up and be counted one way or the other.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.320]   But you can only do that if you know what's happening.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.240]   Well, right.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.760]   And that's why we just spent an hour talking about it.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.240]   We're going to take a break when we come back to the news of the week.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.640]   Mike Masnick from Tech Dirt, Miriam Schwar, great to have you here as well.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:22.080]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace again, an amazing place to make your website.

[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:25.000]   I mentioned the AT&T thing Comcast says, they support the President's Net Neutrality Planets.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.560]   Except for that title two thing.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.560]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.920]   Well, the thing with Comcast is they've been running ads all summer that say we totally
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.240]   support Net Neutrality.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.240]   Right.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.800]   Except that they don't.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.800]   No.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.800]   No.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.200]   You know, they've really figured out that because this is a complicated issue, they can basically
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:56.600]   say that they support it and try and trick people into believing they support it when
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.600]   they don't.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.600]   What a world.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600]   They're just lying, basically.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.600]   The big lie.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.600]   It lives on TV.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:04.600]   It lives on TV.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.600]   They own TV, right?
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.160]   It's just amazing.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.960]   I think this is not something we're done with.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.120]   We'll continue to cover it.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.480]   We'll let you know what the moves are.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.520]   And I think your best bet is to at least to write your member of Congress, your Congress
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:25.920]   Critter as Cory Doctorow would say and let them know you feel strongly about this and
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920]   tell them what you want.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:32.600]   I'm not going to tell you what to say, but EFF does has a great action page, EFF.org.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.560]   I think it's slash action where they have not only will get you your member of Congress's
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.120]   email and mail address.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.080]   Snail mail's best, by the way, or a phone call, but they'll give you.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.080]   There you go.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.280]   Help us fight for your digital rights.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.480]   They also have their active in surveillance, you know, the NSA spying.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.080]   Hey, here's a good one.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.240]   Have you heard about dirt boxes?
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.840]   Oh, my God.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:00.840]   So this was in the Wall Street Journal this week.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:08.280]   Finally, the Department of Justice is flying sessness, small planes out of 19 airports all
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.480]   over the country.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.080]   These small planes have something built by Boeing called a dirt box inside.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:22.520]   And what they do is they pose as a cell tower and all the phones below these sessness will
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.880]   log into the cell tower.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:30.760]   They will harvest your unique ID, your geolocation and who knows what else they'll get.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:35.240]   As much as they can from you as they fly over.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.120]   They say, quote, non-suspect cell phones are let go.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.040]   But if you're a suspect, well, we got you.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:48.240]   Now I got to tell you, in no instance has the NSA ever let go of any of that information.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.960]   They just store it for later use.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.520]   And I have to think that the Department of Justice.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520]   We're allowed to swear.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:59.400]   Wait, I'm just asking because like, is the NSA trying to go ahead say it?
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   Is the NSA trying to not.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.400]   Well, this is the NSA.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.400]   This is the DOJ.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.520]   There's somebody out there that's just like thinking, how can we screw them over?
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.800]   This is about as bad as you can get.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.800]   Even more, right?
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:15.480]   He's like, everybody tries to outdo themselves as how much they can screw us over.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.240]   Non-suspect cell phones are let go.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:21.200]   But the dirt box focuses on gathering information from the target.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.200]   They're flying these all the time over 90% of the US population.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.200]   Who's the target?
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   The US.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.200]   The US.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.200]   Who's the target?
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.200]   What do you?
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.200]   I don't understand.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.080]   We know when I see helicopters hovering overhead, I figure, oh, there's a bad guy with a gun
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.080]   running around.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.920]   But these are going all the time every day.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.320]   The plane moves to another position to dissect signal strength and location.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.680]   And the system can use that information to find the suspect within three meters or within
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.240]   a specific room in a building.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.720]   And they're flying these all the time.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:58.720]   I tell you, they're trying to compete for how, you know, worse they can be dirt bags, dingos.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.720]   They're all dingos.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:03.360]   Chris Seguayan, who we love, he's at the ACLU's chief technologist.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.280]   But he's also one of the best security guys out there.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   For we got to get Chris Seguayan on these.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.520]   Is Sal Seguayan's brother?
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.760]   We almost sell.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.360]   He says it's a quote, "dragnet surveillance program."
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:17.040]   It's inexcusable and it's likely to the extent judges are authorizing it that they have no
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.240]   idea of the scale of it.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.240]   Yep.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.680]   The US Marshals Service is doing this.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.760]   Yep.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   They were bored.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:35.800]   I should point out that the courts have held that this kind of metadata, like location,
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.880]   cell phone number, cell phone ID, is not considered content.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.800]   So you don't need a warrant to harvest it.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:49.520]   It's the same, you know, so the, the, the, a pen register will work.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.360]   You know, so this is basically, there's, I'm sure there's no judge or court overseeing
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.360]   this.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.160]   This is just, yeah.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.320]   It's a, it's a, yeah.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:05.280]   It's a little bit different in that the, the stuff with, with the metadata versus, versus
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:09.480]   data is, you know, where they're going to a third party and getting it here.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.000]   You know, the government is the third party.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.160]   The government is stepping in and collecting this data themselves with the fake towers.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.840]   And you know, it's the, the airplanes, the revelation this week, that's a big deal.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:25.120]   But the fact is the US Marshals Service has been giving out these things, not, not attached
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:29.200]   to planes, but been giving out what's called stingrays, which is basically the same thing.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.280]   But on the ground, they've been giving them to police departments around the country and
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.520]   making them sign NDA.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.080]   So the police departments can't even talk about it, including to judges.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.640]   So even when cases come up that use this evidence, they don't tell the judges.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.680]   And so the, the people who are caught using it can't even protest that it, that it's
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.200]   violating their fourth amendment rights in any way.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.800]   And so the whole thing is a complete mess.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:58.880]   So Goyan says, yeah, well, maybe if you're trying to track a drug dealer involving hundreds
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:06.280]   of people might be okay, but not tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.320]   The Department of Justice, US military and intelligence say this technology has been
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.600]   effective in catching suspected drug dealers and killers.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:21.000]   But they won't say who, because as you say, Mike, they don't reveal that.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   It's unclear.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   This is the Wall Street Journal.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   How closely the Justice Department oversees the program.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.200]   One person familiar with the program said, what is done in US soil is completely legal.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.160]   Whether it should be done is a separate question of the stingrays south or I'm sorry, Chris
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.420]   to Goyan said, maybe it's worth violating the privacy of hundreds of people to catch
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:40.420]   a suspect.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.920]   But is it worth thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people's privacy
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:49.120]   Verizon, by the way, says it's not our towers.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:52.640]   This says we are unaware of the program, but the security of our network and privacy is
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640]   top priorities.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.120]   However, to be clear, the equipment reference in the article is not Verizon's.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.400]   Because that solves everything.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.720]   AT&T and Sprint declined to comment.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:04.720]   Wow.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.720]   Unbelievable.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.720]   All right.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.960]   I just thought I'd mention that.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.960]   Wow.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.720]   By the way, AT&T.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:16.880]   So you heard that both Verizon and AT&T were sending a unique identifier to any website
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.560]   that you surfed to on a Verizon or AT&T phone.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:22.840]   AT&C said, oh, that was just a pilot program.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:25.080]   We're not going to do that anymore.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   We tried it.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.080]   It works, but we're going to stop that.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.080]   They did.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.760]   In fact, they said, and anything we gathered, we will sell that data, but we're not going
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760]   to do that anymore.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760]   Right.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.760]   But Verizon's not stopping.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   No.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   Oh, no.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:40.560]   But they say as with any program, we are constantly evaluating it.
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.560]   Right.
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.960]   Well, that I mean, that gets back to the net neutrality question, right?
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.360]   And this idea that can you make enough noise to stop the bad behavior?
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.360]   Right.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:53.400]   And sometimes you can, but in Verizon's case, in this situation, apparently you can't.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:54.400]   Get this.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.720]   Verizon says the data it sells is not tied to a user's identity.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.800]   None of the data that is used in the program is personally identifiable.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.720]   There is a unique identifier for-- this is a Verizon phone.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:09.480]   This phone has a unique identifier, and every time I surf on the Verizon network, that unique
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.160]   identifier is sent to the website.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.160]   Yep.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.320]   And Verizon's not sending a my name with the identifier, but they don't have to.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.800]   No.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.360]   That's easily put together.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.960]   That's trivial.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:29.120]   Verizon says you can opt out, but it won't remove the tracking ID.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.320]   I don't know what that means.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.720]   It means you can opt out.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.720]   You can opt out.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:35.720]   There's an opt out button.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.720]   We're not going to stop doing it.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:39.720]   But nothing happens when you click it.
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:40.720]   Unbelievable.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.720]   Phone, you know about that.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.800]   That's a fun, Ken Sec West does that every year where they put out unmodified operating
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.560]   systems with all the major computers, and they bring the hackers in.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.920]   And there's a fairly large prize in the Pwned-Own contest.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.480]   They now do a mobile Pwned-Own.
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:02.840]   This was held at PACS-S Applied Security Conference in Tokyo on Thursday.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:10.560]   If you find a bug, a $150,000 prize, $100,000-- that's in the US.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:16.160]   $50,000 for messaging services, $75,000 for short distance, like a Bluetooth exploit,
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:19.120]   $50,000 for browser apps.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.680]   So they had a fire phone.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.120]   I don't know why they bothered.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.120]   But anyway--
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.120]   Because it was easier to hack.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.120]   It's easy to find.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.120]   An Apple phone, iPhone 5S.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.720]   I guess they didn't have a more modern one.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   The Galaxy S5--
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:30.720]   I know.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.640]   They're not using the latest phones.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.640]   Well, but I bet they're using 8.1.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.440]   They keep them at the end.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.440]   If they hack them?
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440]   Yes, they do.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.440]   Well, then you need to have the latest.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440]   Who was it?
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.560]   What was the guy named who always-- he pwned the Mac every time.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.320]   And he'd always get a new laptop every year.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.200]   Yeah, I don't remember his name, but I remember the story.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   And Kaminsky, I think.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.200]   That's it.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.200]   Right?
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.640]   Samsung Galaxy S5, Google Nexus.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.680]   All completely owned or pwned.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.680]   I'm sorry, I didn't spell it.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.360]   I bet you nobody tried to hack the fire phone because nobody wanted it.
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.880]   No, somebody pwned it.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.680]   The Lomiya 1520 running Windows Phone was partially pwned.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:12.600]   I don't know what partially pwned means.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.600]   It's pwned.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.600]   Am I saying pwn right?
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.600]   You guys are hackers.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:16.600]   Am I saying that right?
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.600]   P-W-N.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.160]   I'll say it that way.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.320]   What a partially pwned--
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.000]   Mike, do you say owned or pwned?
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.880]   I go with pwned too, but it always sounds weird when I do, so.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.960]   Pwned owned.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.040]   The 1520 partially pwned.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040]   Pwned?
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.200]   That's pwned.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:42.120]   The BlackBerry Z30, the iPad Mini and the Nexus 7, nobody wanted them, so they weren't
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.120]   targeted at all.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.120]   Wow.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.040]   That's random.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:53.720]   They don't reveal the exploits, by the way, to the public until they're first shared with
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.240]   the vendors.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.560]   And once the bugs are closed, then they'll tell the rest of us.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.480]   I wonder how that works, you know.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:02.560]   If you find a bug in Apple stuff and you go up to them and say, "Hey, I've found this."
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.560]   I pwned you, baby.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.560]   They kill you instantly, right?
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.800]   There's lasers coming around the sky.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.800]   Zop.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:13.440]   The 5S was owned via the Safari browser by exploiting two known bugs.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.440]   Guys, wait.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.600]   People like Kaminsky, they collect these all year long, and they hold on to them until
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.600]   the pwned to own.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.400]   And then they-- it's really-- I've got to see one of these.
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.400]   Have you ever been to one of these?
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.400]   It would be so much fun to do this.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.400]   I haven't.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.400]   The fancooper, I think, every day.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.880]   Then my phones will be hacked.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:29.880]   I know.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:34.360]   If I go into Black Hat or Defgon, you don't want to bring anything.
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:39.560]   The Firephone was breached via three bugs in its browser, the Fire browser.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.960]   The Galaxy S5 was targeted via NFC.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.280]   One triggered a deserialization issue in certain code, the other targeted a logical error, and
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:54.240]   the Nexus 5 was forced-- the sound's kind of vaguely sexual-- was forced to pair with
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.960]   another phone via Bluetooth.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   Oh, boy.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:02.040]   No, maybe pair with that phone!
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040]   Pwned to own.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.160]   It's just like saying that.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.360]   Apple Pay has been very successful.
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.880]   Apple is saying now that-- well, maybe actually McDonald's said this.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.320]   50% of all of McDonald's tap to pay transactions.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.920]   Are you using it?
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.920]   I haven't used it.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.920]   Are you?
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.160]   No, I don't have a 6.06 plus.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:26.120]   Well, the good news is-- well, Whole Foods, for instance, says it has had 150,000 Apple
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:29.760]   Pay transactions in the last two weeks since '81 was released.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.720]   McDonald's has seen a rush of customers.
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:38.080]   50% are bid from Apple Pay, but that means that 50% are from other tap to pay devices.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.080]   No, probably Google.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.880]   Credit cards are Google Wallet.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.080]   And that's really the point.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.480]   Both Google Wallet and Softcard, which is the Verizon solution, formerly known as the
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:47.840]   terrorist group ISIS.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.920]   They renamed that in a hurry, didn't they?
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.280]   Really didn't take long.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.680]   They say they got a bit bumping usage as well.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.840]   So as soon as the awareness of tap to pay-- in fact, that's what I've been tempted to
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:31:59.840]   do is just bring my--
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:00.840]   You just try to break your phone.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:01.840]   I'm just throwing my--
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:02.840]   I'm just throwing my--
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.840]   It's a Verizon phone.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.280]   I just want to get rid of it.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.640]   How is that, by the way?
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.640]   This is the Droid Turbo.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.760]   It's good because it's a Moto X with a massive battery.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.760]   And the big awesome display.
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.760]   That display is really nice.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.760]   It is gorgeous, isn't it?
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:15.760]   Wow.
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.280]   I love these new-- you know, this really-- this burns me a little bit because companies come
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:24.600]   along with big stuff like the Nexus 6 and the Droid Turbo, big batteries, honking great
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.480]   batteries and Note 4.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:30.560]   And then instead of saying great, we're going to give you 25 hours of battery life, they
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:36.560]   say well as long as we got such a big battery, let's put a 2550 by 1440 display on it and--
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560]   Chill the battery life.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:41.200]   --a 3 gigahertz processor and by then it's back to normal.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:44.160]   Can I just have some battery life?
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.160]   That's all I want.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.160]   I thought that was good though.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.160]   This is the best--
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.160]   I love this.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:49.160]   --crap, right?
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.920]   This is almost-- no, one plus one has better battery life.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:54.640]   Just barely, but this is almost-- and it's got all the Moto features like I could say.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.640]   One canobie.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.400]   Is that what you said?
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.400]   Didn't work.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:03.000]   Help me, Obi-Wan, Kenobi.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.960]   You're my only hope.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.360]   So it listens when I say that.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.360]   Well you know what?
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.320]   You got to-- I realize this by the way.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:16.960]   You have to have a long phrase because my watch wakes up-- if I just say, okay, my watch
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:17.960]   wakes up.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:18.960]   Do you notice that?
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.960]   Sometimes, yeah.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:20.960]   Okay, for a little bit of it.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:21.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:26.120]   I'm not talking to you now.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   And prove it your point.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:31.880]   And have you noticed that if you turn on the "Hey" series thing on-- I'm sorry.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.400]   Everybody at home is getting mad at me right now.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.400]   Why?
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.400]   Because their phones are waking up.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.400]   Oh, let's try this again.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.400]   Are we ready?
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.400]   No.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.400]   Come on.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:41.400]   Go on.
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.400]   Go do it.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.400]   Okay, Google.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:44.400]   So I had--
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:45.400]   It's just too easy.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.640]   I have now turned off "Hey" series on all my iPhones because it wakes up in the middle of
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:49.640]   the night.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.640]   Let's do the Xbox.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.640]   That's what I sound like.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:51.640]   [SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND OF SOUND
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:58.640]   Do you want to do the Xbox?
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:59.640]   What do you say on the Xbox?
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.640]   I don't know.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:01.640]   What is it, Paul?
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:02.640]   Xbox, pause.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.640]   That's right.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.280]   And then all the people watching us in Xbox now are not watching us anymore.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.280]   That sucks.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.440]   It's counterproductive, Leo.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.440]   Look at the chat room.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.440]   See?
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.440]   There goes my watch.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.880]   My Xbox just powered off.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.880]   It's Xbox power off.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:16.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880]   It's bad.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   You're a dingo.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:24.200]   I can't help it.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.360]   Not as much as Tom Wheeler.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:28.520]   Not as much as-- nobody's as much of a dingo as Tom Wheeler.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:29.520]   Okay.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.920]   50% of Apple Pay, 50% of McDonald's Tapped Fate transaction.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.400]   I'm sure that's the statistic that Apple would love to tap.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:41.160]   More Big Macs were sold with Apple Pay than any other Tapped Fate.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:43.080]   It's because its phones have grown bigger.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.360]   As the people who own them grow bigger.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.360]   As of McDonald's.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.920]   Has anybody used the YouTube music?
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.800]   It's called Music Key?
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.800]   No.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.200]   Service, I think it rolls out this week.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.800]   If you have all access--
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.800]   I do.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.800]   That's right.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:01.000]   --the Google Music Service, you'll get it automatically.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000]   It's a key.google.com.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.760]   Actually, just go to youtube.com and you should see a music tab.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.920]   That's new at the top of your screen.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:09.920]   Yeah, I've got it.
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:13.240]   Now, it's not doing anything special right now.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.080]   I'm getting YouTube mixes.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.080]   Nonstop play.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.960]   Oh, I guess I am getting it.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.000]   These are nonstop playlists based on a song or artist.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.920]   Where's the tab?
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:23.920]   You don't have it on your YouTube?
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:24.920]   Go have it right there.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:25.920]   Ooh.
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.920]   See that?
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.920]   It says in the mood for music.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:28.920]   Play it again.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:29.920]   Music I've listened to before.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:30.920]   Oh, Taylor Swift.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:33.360]   I did not listen to Taylor Swift take it.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.800]   I did not listen to her shake it off.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.760]   It says I did, but it's a lot.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.200]   Just saying.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.200]   Recent activity on Google Play.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:45.360]   So this is kind of cool.
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.840]   And the idea is that you'll have ad-free music, but not ad-free YouTube.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:51.840]   I'm so excited.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.240]   Half of it is from Vivo and half of it is Taylor Swift.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.800]   That's my takeaway.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.440]   Nicki Minaj, Pills and Potions.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.640]   I don't think I listen.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.800]   Nicki Minaj, Vava Voom.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.800]   Why do I listen?
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:04.800]   I don't think I listen to all this Nicki Minaj.
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:05.800]   This Susie Sue in the Banshees.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:06.800]   A mix.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.800]   Susie in the Banshees.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:08.800]   That's more our thing.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.800]   That's because we're old.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.800]   I know.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.800]   Don't tell anyone.
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.920]   Here's a hitting the gym mix.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:19.440]   This is straight out of, see I'm getting an ad right now, but once this clicks in, I
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440]   won't get an ad.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:21.920]   Are you sure about that?
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920]   Yeah, that's what they say.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.920]   Ad-free.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.680]   And you can play forever.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.480]   Oh my.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:33.640]   This is my, this is what Google thinks I want to listen to in the gym.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:36.080]   Why would I want video?
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.480]   Oh my God.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:42.000]   Those who are listening at home, you're really missing the fun.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.840]   Yeah, this is actually pretty crazy.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.080]   This is fairly homo-erotic.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.840]   I got to tell you.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.560]   Wow.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.560]   What year was this?
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:51.560]   It's Olivia Newton-John.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:52.560]   It's like 81.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.560]   1981.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.560]   1981.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.480]   And look, you like the Tron Grid in the bag?
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.480]   Yeah, isn't that?
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.480]   That's high tech.
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.040]   I think we should do, you and I should do a Mystery Science Theater with three sounds.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:04.960]   Olivia Newton-John and her Cabana boys present, let's get physical.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.880]   That's right.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.400]   This is Google's suggestion.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:11.840]   Well, they clearly love you.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.080]   I think I'm the guy on that extra cycle.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.080]   Wow.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.080]   Oh.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.080]   Oh.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.080]   All right.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.080]   All right.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.080]   All right.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.080]   We're going to take a break.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.080]   We got to take a break.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.080]   I'm overheating now.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.080]   I'm overheating.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.080]   I'm overheating.
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:28.080]   Can I give a snack?
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.800]   Would you like a snack, Mary?
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:30.800]   Sure.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.800]   Mike, if you would come up next time, I will give you a snack.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:33.800]   Absolutely.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:34.800]   A nature box.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.800]   A nature box.
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:36.800]   Oh, look at that.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.480]   Delicious nutritionist designed snacks to your door.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.480]   You get to choose.
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.480]   Flax fortune coins.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.920]   Flax fortune coins are quite good.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.120]   The blueberry nom nom.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.120]   Popcorn.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.120]   That's really good.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.160]   Coffee kettle popcorn, big island pineapple if you like.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.240]   All of these are nutritionist approved.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:58.920]   No HFCs, no trans fats, no artificial flavors, no artificial colors, just delicious snacks.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.360]   And I'm going to get you five snacks for free.

[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:07.600]   If you go to naturebox.com/twit, you've just paid $2 for shipping.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.920]   It's a great way to try nature box to get an idea of what nature box offers.
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.480]   Drop the candy bar, put away the potato chips.
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.720]   Those aren't good for you.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.320]   Get delicious wholesome snacks from naturebox.com.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:22.920]   For the kids, for the family, for business, nature box has literally hundreds of snacks
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.000]   on their web page.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.320]   You could choose from savory, sweet, or spicy.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.320]   You like sriracha?
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.800]   You seem like a sriracha kind of person.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   Maybe.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.800]   That's okay.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:32.800]   Flax.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.800]   Flax fortune coins.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:34.800]   Well, I'm going to do the popcorn.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   Can't help coffee kettle corn.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   Can't help coffee kettle corn.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.800]   Can't help corn.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.800]   Can't help corn.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.800]   Can't help corn.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:47.080]   Can't any machine grab a lemon pucker pistachio or a strawberry Greek yogurt pretzel or a mango
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.520]   orange fruit chew.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:52.520]   You got the coffee kettle popcorn, kettle corn with coffee caramelized popcorn.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:57.040]   All of these, by the way, in sealed bags that you can reseal, which is really nice.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.200]   Actually, I don't think you can reseal this one.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.200]   You have to eat the whole thing.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.200]   Sorry.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:02.200]   It's okay.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.200]   Nature box.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.200]   Right on the side there.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.960]   Nutritionist approved.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.320]   For the drive home.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.560]   You can have that for the drive home.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.560]   Thank you.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.160]   And if you want to go to the drive home, you can have a free sample.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.040]   You just paid $2 postage and there's and look at Olivia's still singing.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.040]   Still going.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.680]   And the guys are going off together in the gym.
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.880]   And she's like, oh, no guys.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.880]   She chose that one.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:24.880]   Well, there you go.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.280]   Now I know why Google chose this video for me.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.280]   Olivia likes.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.280]   Wow.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.280]   Big men.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:33.720]   I'm not I'm not fat.
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.280]   I'm thick.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:41.560]   Do not clear data for Google service framework.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.560]   This is funny.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.560]   Did you talk about this on all about Andrea?
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.560]   I bet you did Jason.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.560]   In fact, I know you did.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.720]   I saw it in the promo.
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:52.920]   So the Moto X apparently is only a small number of people are getting updates to Lollipop
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:59.560]   on the Moto X, but it's pissing the Nexus 5 folks off because they say, but I bought
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.760]   the Google phone and I'm not getting Lollipop yet.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.880]   And the G3 is getting a Lollipop and the Moto G is getting a lot.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:07.880]   The Samsung G3?
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:08.880]   No, the LG G3.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:09.880]   Oh, the LG G3.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:10.880]   Is it?
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.120]   In some markets, Poland.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:20.760]   So actually there was a post on Reddit by a Google engineer who explained how this works.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:21.760]   Just so you know.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.760]   I read it.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.760]   Of all things.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.760]   Yes.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:25.760]   This is the PSA.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.520]   It says, do not clear data for Google for service framework.
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.440]   Now if you are geek enough to know why to do that, why.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.800]   I'll show you right now.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:37.240]   No, I could do it, but there is a reason not to do this.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:41.320]   So why are people doing this because they are getting the APK or whatever it's called,
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.320]   the zip.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:48.720]   Actually I think it's a tar file for the OS update and all of the final images are available
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.240]   for all the phones.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:51.520]   They're downloading them.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:58.080]   But in order to install them, you have to go through some, jump through some hoops.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:04.520]   And what some people are doing is screwing up their phones by changing this framework
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.760]   by resetting this framework.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:15.880]   And when you do that, when you clear data for the Google service framework, you think
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.880]   Tom broke up to that?
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:18.880]   Or else.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.920]   Somebody with a pot potato in their mouth.
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:22.920]   Or else.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.920]   It changes.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:24.920]   Sean Connery.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.800]   If you change the Google service framework.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.800]   That's right.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:31.360]   It'll change the primary ID by which Google knows your device.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:37.240]   And that's not good because it invalidates the tokens any app uses.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.480]   You're all your apps will break.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.400]   You'll have to log out and log back in.
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:41.400]   It's a mess.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:42.560]   Don't do it.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:45.080]   This guy is a engineer at Google.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.920]   He says nothing bursts into flames when it makes a ton of nuisances on the device, including
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.960]   some that can look pretty mysterious.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.560]   Now what he does say, just so you know, is that 1% of all Android devices, in this
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.600]   case, the Moto X, we'll get it in the first week.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.600]   1%.
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.400]   There is no point in hitting reload, reload.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.440]   Everybody goes to that system update and taps it.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:08.440]   Notice it never changes.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:09.440]   It doesn't change.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.920]   Rarely if ever you'll ever see it switch right over.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:12.920]   I've had it happen.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.920]   Yeah, but that's it.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920]   Okay.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:15.920]   Because you're all the costs of week two.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:16.920]   It's really luck.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:17.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:23.560]   So what he says is we pick a random 1% and those people update and then we wait for the
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.560]   howls of pain.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:31.360]   And if you know, there are no big showstoppers at that point.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:32.360]   Nope.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.360]   I'm not.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   Yeah, let me check.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.280]   There are no big, you have a Nexus 5.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.280]   Yep.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:39.600]   There are no big showstoppers at that point.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:43.160]   Then we will do 25% the second week.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:48.120]   So if you're using a Moto, one of those phones, a Moto XG3, Nexus 4 or 5.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.120]   It's pre-emptive.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.120]   It's how to check that 4.40.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.120]   4.40.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.120]   Yeah, it's always checking.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.120]   Of course it's always checking.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.880]   There's no point in doing this refreshing.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:55.880]   No, why don't you just wait?
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.080]   You're not in the 1% you're not in the 1%.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.080]   Just be patient.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.080]   It's like a slowly pop.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:01.080]   It's great.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:04.160]   I've got it on my Nexus 9, but it's not like going to change your life or something.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.160]   No.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:08.720]   Because people have been waiting however long for it already and now that it's out, they
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.120]   got to have it right now.
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:16.960]   It's just a senior, the excitement of when you find it and get it in week two.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:21.480]   Well, and I mean, the other side of this is, like you said, ADB side load.
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:22.960]   That's going to go over a lot of people's head.
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:28.040]   But if you really need to do this, you download the Android SDK, plug it into your computer
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:31.800]   with a USB, and you do a couple of terminal tests.
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:32.800]   It works.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.320]   Don't do that.
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:37.160]   If you really need to, there is an option for you.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:40.160]   You're going to wipe your phone in the process so it has a downside.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.400]   You start from scratch.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.400]   But there are options.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:43.400]   You don't have the way to do it.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:47.240]   So if you're the kind of person that watches all about Android every week.
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.760]   Yes, you're in the hot session.
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:49.760]   You should do that.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.800]   The majority of people aren't going to do that though.
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:52.800]   I hope not.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.800]   Just complicated enough.
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.800]   Jason's our guy now.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.800]   I know.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:56.800]   Look at that.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:57.800]   He is the lead producer.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:58.800]   Isn't that great?
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:43:59.800]   Look at seriousness.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:00.800]   He's powerful.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.040]   He's also the first producer I've ever had that I can actually see over the top of the
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.040]   screen.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.040]   It's true.
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.280]   Well, the problem is where the screen is located, I know you're looking at the screen, but
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.360]   I'm pretty sure you're looking at me the entire time.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360]   I know.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.360]   Your eye level is all the time.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.360]   I'm doing this.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.360]   I got my eye on you.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.560]   A lot of pressure.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:19.560]   All right.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.120]   Google Glass, is it dead?
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:22.120]   Yes.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.080]   When exactly did it die?
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:28.800]   I'll tell you for me when my Google Glass usage died.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:29.800]   You have one.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.800]   I have it.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.800]   I have an explorer.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.800]   I'm an explorer.
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.800]   I paid the crazy money.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.880]   Let me think when I really stopped using it.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:40.840]   I think it was some time in the spring to summertime-ish.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.800]   After mobile congress some time, there was a spermotate that really borked the battery
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:46.800]   life.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:47.800]   Oh, really?
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:49.760]   It's never recovered from that, really.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.960]   Mike, are you a glass hole?
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:52.960]   I have.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.200]   I've actually never even tried it.
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.200]   Good.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.680]   I can't stay that way.
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:57.680]   I think it's interesting.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:02.240]   Here I am on Reuters with this article, Google Glass, Future Clouded at some early
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.880]   believers lose faith.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:05.880]   They have a picture of Sergei Brin.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.640]   Who's not wearing them?
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.840]   He's worn them because it's his baby.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:11.920]   He's been wearing them ever since they came out.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:16.520]   He was at the red carpet during the second annual Breakthrough Prize Awards at NASA Ames
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:19.120]   on November 9th, not wearing the first time he was seen in public.
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:24.800]   Oddly enough, right next to it, Viagra helps guys with ED get and keep an erection.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:29.720]   I think that there's some relationship between wearing Google Glass and an erectile dysfunction.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.720]   I guess.
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:31.720]   I don't know.
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.880]   I'm just saying.
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.880]   Google wouldn't put this ad there.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:41.840]   I did have a weird experience that can also made me question glass was, "Admobile Congress,
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.840]   I'm a T-Mobile customer, so I had free roaming."
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:45.840]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.840]   Fantastic.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.840]   Best thing ever, right?
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:48.840]   Yes.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:53.960]   Google Glass is supposed to do its updates and download the mega gigabytes of update only
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:57.960]   when it's battery powered on a Wi-Fi network, right?
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:06.160]   I'm Mobile Congress, not on Wi-Fi, but I had plugged my glass to charge over USB battery.
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:12.520]   For some magical reason, it decided to download the update over my connection.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:13.520]   That's bad.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.520]   My roaming connection.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:19.040]   Everybody's telling me, by the way, that they're not seeing that Viagra ad.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.040]   But here's the...
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.040]   That it's only on my own.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.720]   But here's the thing, Leo.
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:28.960]   So it downloads this update and I call the guys at Tmo, and be like, "Are you going to
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:29.960]   kill me now?
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.960]   Because I just download two gigabytes on my data room."
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.960]   And they're like, "No."
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:34.960]   The fact that it even works is amazing.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:35.960]   They're like, "That's free.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:36.960]   It's free.
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:37.960]   Free is free.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:38.960]   You don't have to worry about it."
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:39.960]   But it's 2G, right?
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:40.960]   It's not high speed.
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:41.960]   No, it's not high speed.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:42.960]   So I call Google.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:43.960]   I call the Glass.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:44.960]   And you're like, "What the f--?"
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:46.960]   What the dingo?
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:50.360]   They're like, "You're not supposed to take Glass abroad."
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:51.560]   You broke the terms of service.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.560]   What?
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:53.560]   It says you can't take Glass abroad.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:54.560]   No, it's the tongue that I've got.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:56.960]   But it's like, they play that game with me.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.360]   I'm like, "You didn't use it right.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360]   You took it with you abroad.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.040]   You're not supposed to do that."
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.040]   We haven't...
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.040]   Wow.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.040]   Right?
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.040]   Okay, so talk about customer service.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.120]   Rintold reporter, "Oh, I brought it.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.280]   I left it in the car."
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:10.720]   I'm not kidding.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:11.720]   I swear to God.
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:15.880]   Because it dries with it, clearly.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:20.280]   The Google Glass rollout, the actual mass market sales.
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:22.200]   You can still buy it for $1,500.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:25.600]   But presumably they're going to do a less expensive version.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:33.280]   They're saying now is down the road, maybe not till next year or the year after.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:39.400]   Of the 16 Glass app makers that Reuters contacted, 9 said they'd stopped work or abandoned their
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:44.040]   projects because of lack of customers or limitations of the device.
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:47.760]   Three more have switched to developing for business only.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:48.760]   So let's see.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:53.480]   That means there's four consumer projects remaining.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:57.960]   There are also several key Google employees in the Glass division have left the company
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.600]   in the last six months.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:05.560]   Lead developer, Babak Parvis, electrical engineering chief Adrian Wong and Osama Alami, who is
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.720]   the director of developer relations.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:11.360]   I think this is the beginning of the end.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:16.120]   I said right when it came out, I said, "I don't really think that this is designed to be a
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:17.120]   consumer product.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.120]   This is designed to understand wearables.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.040]   We don't understand them yet."
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.960]   And to get some data, Google is a data-driven company.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.360]   I think this is also telling.
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:33.800]   Remember there was a VC fund for Glass development.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.400]   The website's gone.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.880]   Glass Cloud users, the main Glass site.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.480]   I think that's pretty much the end of the line on this.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.040]   Are we sad?
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.040]   No.
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:52.320]   But I mean, honestly, I think there were a lot of issues with the way Glass users use
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:56.720]   their license, which I think got maybe blown out of proportion by some people.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:03.040]   I think there's a root kind of cultural societal issue that made Glass fail in some ways.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:05.880]   It really came back and did it, didn't it?
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:10.440]   But I think at the same time, I think Kudos to Google for trying, for going crazy.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440]   I agree with you.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:16.360]   Going out there, trying to build the tech, making it happen, and making it relatively
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.040]   reasonably affordable.
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.360]   We could get to see what it would be like when it's incorporated in these glasses.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.360]   Here's the good news.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:26.840]   If you go to eBay, you can get Google Glass 2.0 XE with all original accessories and box.
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:27.840]   $730.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.360]   Still too much money.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360]   $750.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.360]   These are half off.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:33.480]   Then there's some idiot selling it for $2,000.
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.480]   Obviously didn't get them enough.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:41.240]   I still think it's an interesting project.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:43.720]   The idea is really interesting.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:49.800]   I think we're seeing some of what they learned in the Android Wear stuff and the smartwatches.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:52.400]   I don't think it was a bad idea.
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.400]   No, I agree.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:59.080]   You should certainly create some issues in a variety of ways.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:04.760]   The idea of wearables and doing interesting things with wearables, I think that's definitely
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.760]   the right direction for them to be.
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:12.760]   I should say that Google did give a statement to Reuters saying, "No, we are as committed
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.160]   to Glass as a consumer product as ever.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.320]   This is going to take time and we're not going to launch this product until it's absolutely
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.320]   ready.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.720]   That's Glass head of business operations, Chris O'Neill."
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:31.920]   I wrote an editorial for Android Central back in April, May about my Glass experience.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:39.360]   If you guys want to look for Google at my name, Glass, Android Central.
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.360]   Miriam Glass-Hole.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:43.000]   Yeah, they know.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.640]   Miriam Jour.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:45.840]   I'm with both of you.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:53.440]   I really feel like wearables is clearly a category that's going somewhere.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:59.840]   What I think we've seen so far is it's not clear how or what features or what technologies.
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:00.840]   There you go.
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:01.840]   Glass didn't really seem to do it.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:02.840]   I was never as excited.
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:07.520]   In fact, when I got a Glass invitation and I bought him, but I gave him to Jason because
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:08.520]   he had a kid.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:18.000]   They've come in really handy for the very specific use of videotaping my kids from my
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.200]   own point of view, which I've got some amazing video.
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.200]   But you don't wear it anymore.
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.200]   I keep it charged.
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:28.040]   I wait for those moments where I'm like, "Savanna's first steps."
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:29.040]   It was perfect for that.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.040]   It was charged up.
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:31.040]   I was ready.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:34.320]   I had a feeling and she took her first steps while I was wearing glass.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:39.560]   That's a video that I will always cherish because it was actually from my point of view.
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:42.880]   It's like reliving an experience.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.720]   Do we think that Glass at this point, as far as we're three years, almost three years
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.360]   into this grand experience and that experiment?
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:54.840]   It's close to the time where Google actually mentioned it at all to everyone.
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:57.520]   It's almost three years.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.400]   I don't know, I feel like the social damage has been done on this particular product.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:08.360]   If Google had something to follow up with, I really think they'd be defending the product
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:10.040]   at this point a lot more than they are.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:15.400]   I think Wares kind of come along and solved a lot of those problems and wearables in general
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:21.320]   by just basically saying, "Look, a lot of the really cool, compelling things that were
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.440]   use cases for Glass, you're now getting on your wrist in a form factor that people are
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:29.040]   used to seeing and aren't intimidated and frightened by."
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:32.920]   I am a fan, I have to say, of Android Wear.
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:34.600]   I think this Moto 360 is great.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:36.160]   It's great watch.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:38.840]   I've seen a clear use case for it.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:42.280]   For instance, I can navigate when I'm walking around with the maps and it will tell me to
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:45.960]   turn left a little buzz at me and pausing a movie last time.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.600]   There's definitely a clear use case for it.
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.320]   I wear it every day now.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:50.960]   Yeah, obviously.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:56.800]   Mike Butcher and TechCrunch said Glass has taken over from the Segway.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:02.280]   Hype is a game changer but ultimately used by warehouse workers and mall cops.
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:07.040]   So now they're wearing glass writing their Segways.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:10.160]   Yeah, in fact, I think that's where you're going to see them.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:14.080]   And that's really safe.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:15.240]   I'm just saying.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:17.320]   I think we should talk about Microsoft.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.080]   Is there anything to say about Microsoft?
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.080]   The Microsoft Shackle?
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.840]   Yeah, the 535 is cool.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:23.840]   They're not going to sell the US.
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.440]   I don't think this is the new Lumia, the first Lumia.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:27.440]   No, because of the NLT.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.760]   But you know what, for an unlocked phone, the specs it has, it's actually pretty damn cool.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:36.160]   It's pretty clear that Microsoft has decided that it's going to take the Windows phone
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:39.520]   platform in a particular direction.
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:42.840]   They're going to make it for developing markets.
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:44.640]   They're going to make low-cost phones.
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:47.800]   The 1520 is the last flagship, the icon, the last flagship.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:51.240]   And these are not being updated and they're not, frankly, I don't think changing.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:54.920]   You know, I wouldn't be surprised if we get something to fall up on the 9th, the 9th,
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:55.920]   the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th,

[01:53:58.920 --> 01:53:58.920]   the 9th,
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:05.920]   the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the

[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:20.360]   the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the 9th, the
