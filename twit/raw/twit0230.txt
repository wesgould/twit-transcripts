[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.740]   from CNET's Buzz Out Loud.
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.580]   Great to see you, Tom.
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.340]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.940]   Dressed all in black like Johnny Cash.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.140]   Yeah, trying to fade in.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.700]   I'm very impressed.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.420]   Fading in?
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.140]   Is that what they call it?
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.460]   Right into the--
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.580]   No, no one calls it that.
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.140]   Just you.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.020]   He's fading in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.900]   Also fading in, Ms. Molly Wood.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   Hello.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.380]   From CNET's Buzz Out Loud.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.100]   Molly is-- there we go.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.540]   There I am.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.340]   Oh, finally got a camera.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.740]   I'm here.
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.500]   I'm here.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.580]   She's somewhere out there.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.620]   I'm just tucked in here, fading in.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.020]   We got a distant camera.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.420]   I know.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.180]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.540]   Thank you.
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.140]   It's going to be here.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.660]   I got a good Buzz Out Loud with you guys on Thursday.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.220]   That was a treat.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.500]   That was a treat.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.540]   That was a blast.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.220]   That was fun.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.380]   That was really fun.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.220]   You made some announcements, best of C.S. announcements as well,
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.020]   didn't you, Jim and Molly?
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.260]   But there, he's pulling it out.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.460]   The envelope, please.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.020]   Oh, you guys don't have a laptop?
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.500]   No.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.020]   No, no.
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.780]   So this is good.
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.620]   I feel a little disconnected from the chat room.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.460]   No, I know.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.460]   I do miss the chat room.
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.460]   But I don't know how to make a camera.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.060]   So you can watch my chat room.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.140]   Molly's got a droid.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.580]   Yep.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.300]   And Tom has an iPhone.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.700]   I feel like we should have some sort of a browser wrist.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.540]   Go ahead.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.660]   We already pulled it up.
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.140]   Three, two--
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.140]   I already pulled it up, too.
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.700]   We're too proud.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.580]   You guys suck.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.580]   Yeah, no, we-- because we prepare for your show.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.700]   Did you look at the Nexus 1?
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.060]   Oh, no.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.220]   See, that's something I don't do.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.940]   So would you please stop it?
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.180]   It's really embarrassing.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.300]   What I really want desperately--
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.020]   I mean, aside from--
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.540]   it doesn't have a keyboard, so there's that.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.780]   It's a beautiful piece of hardware.
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.780]   The really thing that I want desperately is the widget,
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.140]   the built-in Google weather and news widget.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.820]   That's like the big edition in 2.1.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.540]   I couldn't figure out what else they added in 2.1
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.500]   that I would really want, except for that one widget, which
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.580]   is just like super useful.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.660]   But it's right on your desktop.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.060]   It shows you not only the weather, but the news?
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.660]   Yeah, it's got like a news feed coming into it.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.160]   That's cool.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.620]   And it was so addictive.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.500]   I mean, literally, I just saw a couple headlines,
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.260]   and I would click the--
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.420]   I mean, it's probably terrible.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.580]   I'm sure I'll crash the car.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.500]   Here's something that puzzled me.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500]   I was talking to-- it was at an Android party
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.700]   in Android event last--
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.180]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.900]   Tom laughed.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.740]   That was funny, Mom.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.940]   Thank you.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.980]   That's what I like.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.660]   That was amusing.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.140]   That was funny.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.780]   That was hilarious.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.300]   That was quite amusing.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.140]   Veronica does that to me.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.460]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.900]   Hilarious.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.780]   Very funny.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.580]   Sorry.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.500]   What was I saying?
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.540]   Oh, I was at a party.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.180]   I was at a party.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.020]   So there you go.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.020]   Oh, there's more.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.020]   I was at an Android party.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   You were out partying with the Nexus one.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.220]   One of the designers of the Nexus one was there.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.340]   And I asked him about multi-touch.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.860]   And he said, well, actually, multi-touch
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.220]   is built into the Nexus one.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.420]   It's built into the operating system.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.820]   It's built into the hardware.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.060]   You know where it's missing?
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.500]   The Google Apps, like Maps, the Pictures app.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.260]   And why is that?
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.660]   I don't know.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.220]   But if they update it, you've got multi-touch.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.580]   Because Veronica's theory was that Eric Schmidt, coming
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.580]   from the Apple board, had made some pact with the devil
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.220]   that he wouldn't do multi-touch in the US.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.340]   But it sounds--
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.820]   No, no, no.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.860]   I thought it was my third.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.860]   Anyway, yeah, something like that.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.220]   No, no, no, no, it's mine.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.060]   Apparently, it's just a question of updating the apps,
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.140]   which they'll do soon.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.140]   So why didn't they have the apps--
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.660]   Well, why didn't they?
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.740]   Because they have it in Europe on the milestone,
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.620]   which is the droid.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.620]   I don't know if that's the case.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.180]   I think there's a little US license--
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.900]   People have told me they have it in Europe.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.060]   But I don't know if they have it in Europe
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.740]   in the same way that Nexus one has it.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.900]   But it doesn't do it.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.940]   Have you seen somebody do?
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.700]   Anybody in our chat room in Europe?
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   Does the milestone actually do multi-touch?
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.260]   Or is it capable of multi-touch, which
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.140]   is what the Nexus one-- and by the way, apparently the droid is.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.140]   The droid is too.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.140]   Yeah, it's perfectly capable.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.580]   It's built in.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.580]   I think that there was a little bit of a licensing thing
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.460]   in the US.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.580]   No, that's not funny.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.540]   Titus says my girlfriend has multi-touch.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.140]   I don't think that's what we're talking about.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.780]   No, different kind.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.660]   Inappropriate.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.460]   Inappropriate.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.940]   But anyway, I thought it was certainly very hot,
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.740]   but it didn't make me regret buying my droid.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.620]   No, and I guess if the Nexus one gets multi-touch,
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.540]   your droid will get multi-touch.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.500]   I think so, yeah.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.660]   I don't think they're holding it back.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.700]   What deal with who?
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.620]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.180]   Makes no sense.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.980]   They're not holding it back.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.420]   And that's why I wonder if the milestone really does.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.540]   Or maybe--
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.460]   who did the milestone?
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.340]   Motorola, that's the droid version.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.140]   It's the droid.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.140]   Yeah, it's the droid.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.260]   Maybe Motorola in Europe did something.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.620]   I don't know.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.940]   Maybe they may modify the apps.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.980]   Have a different agreement or a different patent situation
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.700]   or something like that.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.420]   I'd like to know one of this.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.940]   Yeah, I'm convinced that it's just a different licensing
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.820]   or patent situation.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.180]   And then so it's OK in Europe.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.180]   I don't know why it would be.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.700]   That doesn't seem because I--
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.340]   but I don't know.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.900]   But the multi-touch was one thing I
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.460]   was bothered with on the Nexus one.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.980]   Otherwise, I really love the phone.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.020]   It works really well.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.700]   It's easy to figure out how to do our droid look
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.260]   like a terminator.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.300]   I didn't feel bad about my droid.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.660]   Really?
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.620]   I mean, that was the one good thing,
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.260]   is I thought the Nexus one was really neat and really pretty.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.300]   But I didn't feel like I was missing a lot with the droid.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.580]   I mean, it didn't make me really like--
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.060]   because sometimes I don't know what happened.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.060]   You know, when you think it's a mic.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.620]   I did not like the on-screen keyboard though.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.860]   I like my keyboard, exactly.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.860]   I like my keyboard.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.820]   Let's get Jay up here.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.740]   And Jay Edelson is here from dig.com.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.820]   And ask him, because he probably does a lot of phones.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.740]   And while he's getting set--
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.060]   let me do a commercial.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.540]   This portion of this week at CES is brought to you by Ford.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.060]   It's just been a long-forward commercial.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.420]   Sync my ride.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.620]   Somebody in the chat room said, and I
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.700]   think it's appropriate question, why would you have a sponsor on?
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.180]   But one thing about our CES coverage
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.300]   is very different from the coverage we do back in the cottage.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.380]   We've had product people on all the time.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.100]   And we will have more product people on, not just
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.060]   because they're a sponsor, but because what is CES all about?
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.820]   But products.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.460]   Normally, I do not have vendors on.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.220]   And kind of Ford this year.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.300]   I mean, they own this.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.180]   They own the show.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.380]   And maybe it's not apparent because Ford's
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.900]   been a sponsor.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.260]   And they're a sponsor of yours too.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.140]   It's not been apparent.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.540]   But we aren't talking about Ford because they're a sponsor
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.180]   as much as because they really owned this show.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.180]   It was a Ford show.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.220]   Let me talk about Google.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.140]   You talk about Ford.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.340]   You talk about Intel.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.660]   I mean, those are people making the news here.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.460]   Let me do-- yeah.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.460]   Well, we'll talk more about all of that just a second.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.380]   Let me do a little bit of a Ford Sync commercial.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.380]   And then we'll be right back.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.940]   This whole trip actually was brought to you by three sponsors.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.740]   The folks at Citrix, the folks at Sync,
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.900]   and the folks at audible.com.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.740]   So we're going to mention all three in the show today.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.660]   And thank them profusely.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.860]   Ford Sync is, as you just heard, the in-car, hands-free,
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.940]   Bluetooth, media player stuff that has done so well
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.820]   in the new Ford cars.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.100]   And you can find out more about it by going to the website,
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.660]   syncmyride.com.
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.900]   I don't think the news for my touch and my touch--
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.180]   what is it?
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.020]   My touch?
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.940]   They rebranded it.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.820]   What's my Ford touch?
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.540]   My Ford and my Ford touch.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.140]   Terrible.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.420]   Sync is so much easier to remember.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.140]   My Ford and my Ford touch.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.060]   Sync is part of my Ford and my Ford touch.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.060]   That's what's even more confusing.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.340]   I know.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.140]   It's just a mess.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.420]   Anyway, I don't know how much they have on the website page
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.300]   there, but you can read a lot of news about all
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.100]   of these new features.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.580]   And it's just really exciting the idea
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.020]   of connecting in your car at that level.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.940]   So I invite you to go to Syncmyride.com,
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.580]   learn more about it.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.060]   And also, of course, the next time you're
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.780]   at a Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer, give it a try.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.660]   Syncmyride.com, or test it out at your Ford Lincoln
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.660]   or Mercury dealer.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.580]   Ford Sync, we appreciate their support.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.220]   They brought us here.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.020]   Jay, you're not here for work.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:45.980]   You're here on vacation.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.540]   I am totally on vacation.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.380]   Completely.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.580]   Now, see, that's my dream.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.580]   Come true is to come to CES and not have to do anything.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.300]   Well, this is my first CES.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.340]   You've never been here?
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.580]   I've sent people for you.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.900]   I've never got to go.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.780]   I've never got to go.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.980]   Doesn't even look like Ringo Star.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.260]   I think Ringo's here.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.180]   I wish I was that cool.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:04.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.700]   If you do the accent, I think we're going to see it a lot.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.100]   I honestly--
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.380]   Honestly, it looks like a cooler beetle than Ringo Star.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.380]   That's so nice.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.380]   It's Herman from Herman's Hermits, is it?
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.460]   You know what?
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.820]   That would be also cooler than me.
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.500]   No, no, no.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.220]   So anyway--
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:18.780]   So this is cool.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.500]   So you are here working.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.740]   You've never been to CES.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.140]   And you said, I want to check it out.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.620]   You know, the thing is, I've always
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.540]   been a gadget nerd my entire life.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.620]   I mean, probably the king of the gadget nerds,
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.380]   but I've never been allowed to CES
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.020]   to end like what would be my native habitat, right?
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.060]   And I got here.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.860]   And when my friends who are working here saw me,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.580]   they're like, oh, well, you can't actually see all of CES.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.380]   It's like too hard.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.100]   I'm like, there's only four days, and there's 8,000.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.340]   I swear to you, I think I might have seen everything.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.060]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.500]   Finally, in authority.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.820]   What do you like in chair?
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.660]   You know, it's like my knees are scaring.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.420]   Can we get chair?
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.020]   Can we get chair?
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.260]   I can use this poor guy.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.300]   He's just not like--
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.340]   You're in agony.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.700]   The reason I brought you in--
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.700]   I brought you in.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.460]   Thank you so much.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.900]   So we need you to help us with this Nexus 1 thing versus Troy.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.500]   Did you see that you must have seen it?
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.020]   I did.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.980]   First of all, let's get this out on the table.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.260]   What do you carry?
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.180]   I carry an iPhone today.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.100]   And by the way, that's novel, because as far as I'm concerned--
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.900]   and by the way, you'll notice no skin,
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.860]   no listening, special things, no cases.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.140]   Do you like Hugo Bearback?
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.060]   I go Bearback.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.860]   Mayday.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.500]   That's OH.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.980]   For me, I couldn't use an iPhone for all since it came out,
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.500]   because I was living in rural New York,
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.500]   and there was no AT&T coverage.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.300]   So I moved out to California thinking, hey, I can now--
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.220]   Oh.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.100]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.980]   You should have emailed me.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.500]   I told you what I warned you about.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.220]   It was a little top, and I can tell you right now,
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.420]   I'm investigating other phones to choose as an alternative.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.340]   So did you look at a Nexus 1?
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:51.820]   It's a good time.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.340]   I looked at the Nexus 1, and I think my first impression
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.060]   is I love Android.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.220]   I love the operating system.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.660]   I love the openness of that.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.220]   I'm excited.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.580]   It has enough apps for me.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.740]   The one thing it doesn't have yet is Verizon,
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.940]   or the CDMA, Sprint style--
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.660]   Well, coming this spring.
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.160]   Right?
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.260]   So am I going to get that, guys?
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.500]   Coming this spring to Verizon.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:13.860]   Yep.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.220]   All right.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.220]   That's what I've heard.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.100]   So that, I think, might, in fact, be my phone.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.980]   In the meantime, you could get one of these
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.100]   and just turn it on, and then you actually get data.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.820]   He's got a Sprint Verizon MyFi.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.820]   It's a good idea.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:26.900]   It is a good idea.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.260]   Verizon MyFi has saved Tom's iPhone, I think.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:29.700]   It is.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.700]   Now, the question is, though, will the Android have
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.420]   Red Laser, one of my favorite apps of all time?
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.380]   Isn't Red Laser Scans Barcodes and tells you
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.860]   where you can get it cheaper?
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.620]   Oh, the Android has a barcode.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.660]   Android has a barcode.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.500]   Android invented the product.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.540]   But I don't know if it has--
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.180]   No, it does it better than Red Laser.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.340]   There are three applications that do it, all of them free.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.700]   And the thing about Red Laser is it's
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.220]   a copy of those applications.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.340]   Shop Savvy is the one I use for big engine.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:57.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.660]   We're using Shop Savvy.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.740]   Shop Savvy is incredible.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.820]   Like a custom version for CNET 2 for electronics.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.820]   It's incredible.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.660]   And the thing is, you couldn't do it on the iPhone
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.780]   until the 3GS, because it didn't have an autofocus camera.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.580]   But the G1 did from day one.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.300]   So, in fact, that's a category that--
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.740]   Well, they're only fine.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.900]   I should be fine with that.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.060]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.580]   All right.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.020]   I'm all over it.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:15.980]   You'll like Shop Savvy.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.500]   I think it's--
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.300]   That's just showing me.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.860]   I can download it now, too, because I'm on Verizon.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.780]   I am such a dude.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.420]   You know, I had the BlackBerry for years.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.260]   Leo, you know I was always a BlackBerry guy.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.380]   And I had to give it up.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.060]   That's kind of a telecom kind of a thing.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.660]   Yeah, it's a little bit if you're a telecom.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.700]   A little corporatey.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.220]   Yeah, it is.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.500]   But do you think we're going to see even better Android
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.940]   phones throughout the course of the year?
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.460]   Yes.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.940]   Because Google has said, we're going to roll out
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.460]   a ton of these things.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.220]   Well, that's exactly what they told me at this party,
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.540]   is that this is just the beginning.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.500]   And the other thing I asked him, which I kind of surprised me,
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.060]   is, well, if that's the case, why do you sell a unlocked version?
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.780]   You have to use this with T-Mobile anyway.
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.220]   You have to buy a T-Mobile account.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.380]   Why would anybody buy $529 for an unlocked version versus $199?
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.300]   Since you have to get a T-Mobile account.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.300]   Now, T-Mobile does offer a month by month account.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.980]   So you can not lock in on the T-Mobile system.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.300]   Well, that's worth a lot though.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:06.980]   That apparently--
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.140]   Yeah, it is.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.900]   What it tells me is that this is a phone for a narrow niche
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.180]   that's smart enough to know that,
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.620]   that's smart enough to say I'll buy unlocked.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.580]   He told me that by far the majority of buyers
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.740]   are buying unlocked--
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.100]   Wow.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.220]   --not locked--
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.340]   --by far.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.620]   Well, there's also not any kind of upgrade path through T-Mobile.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.740]   So anybody who's already on T-Mobile, they're not getting
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:25.460]   a discount.
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.660]   Verizon will give you a discount if you've been with them.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.100]   I thought that there was an upgrade option.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.380]   Maybe it was only like a--
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.660]   You can't buy it through T-Mobile.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.900]   You have to buy it from Google.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.780]   You have to buy it from Google, which is why.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.340]   And then people are having-- there may be some kind of discount
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.540]   but they haven't figured out how to apply it.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.460]   And then it's led to that big customer service meltdown.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:43.980]   Let's Google.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.820]   Yeah, that's not a good thing.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.220]   Yeah, let's talk about the customer service meltdown.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.300]   Because they're only complaining about the Nexus 1
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.660]   to this point has been that Google is just unresponsive.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.160]   Right.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.500]   Well, to be fair, it wasn't Apple struggling
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.460]   when it's first few days.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.940]   I mean, we were all impressed with how fast they
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.020]   replenished supply in the stores.
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.500]   But they had the whole store infrastructure.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.700]   But, yeah, the experience of buying an Nexus 1
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.540]   was far superior.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.860]   I waited six hours in line for the first iPhone.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.420]   And it was a nightmare.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.380]   And you're right.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.700]   The servers were down.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.700]   The Nexus 1, I ordered it.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.660]   It came the next day.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.420]   Done.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.420]   Is that because you had the option to wait in line though?
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.780]   If you've been forced to buy it on Apple's website,
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.180]   would it have been the equivalent experience?
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.740]   Now, the other difference is the iPhone
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.140]   you have to activate through iTunes.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.140]   And I think that that's ultimately funky and steady.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.500]   That's where they had support issues was when that went wrong.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.140]   But if I can choose--
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.900]   At least there was someone to call though.
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.780]   Well, right.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.620]   But if I can choose my provider, then a certain amount
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.180]   of customer service experience is not
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.260]   going to be Google's fault.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.940]   It's going to be who I choose might be good or bad.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.180]   And people who had never used the beautiful T-Mobile also
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.860]   complained just a tiny bit of T-Mobile.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.780]   I've never used T-Mobile.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.420]   I've used T-Mobile for a long time.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.460]   I have Blackberry.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.700]   I had-- and right now it's running my N900.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.180]   But as soon as I get home, it's going to--
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.780]   Did you ever have a sidekick?
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.220]   I did.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.140]   I had a T-Mobile sidekick.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.100]   I forgot all about that.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.140]   That actually was a pretty good--
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.180]   That was pretty hip.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.100]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.260]   That's a great way to meet chicks.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.940]   It was my first time I ever saw a phone.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.620]   I went, that is targeting the teenage demo for a phone.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.380]   Right.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.220]   And I was like, wait, teenagers have phones?
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:11.940]   Is that allowed?
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.060]   I guess so.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.020]   We actually gave sidekick the best of CES.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.620]   Remember, Tom?
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.740]   That was when we were back in tech TV.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.260]   That's right.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.180]   It was still the danger--
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:19.500]   It was the same.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.300]   --communicator.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.540]   And we liked it because when you went flip it
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.380]   to the Star Trek sandwich, they had to take out
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.860]   because Paramount would have sued the pants off.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.700]   Actually, speaking of lawsuits, apparently Philip K. Dick's
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.660]   family is threatening to sue Google over the name Nexus.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.980]   That's the Nexus one.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.660]   Because, yeah, it's in do Androids Dream of Electric sheep.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.580]   Nexus 6.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.580]   That's the Android.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.580]   That's the Android.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.740]   It's the Dreaming of the Electric sheep.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.700]   But I think there might be--
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.740]   There's an XSX in Nexus 6.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.740]   There's a reference to Nexus 1.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.340]   There was a previous-- there was Nexus 1, 2, 3, 4.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:47.840]   Right.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.340]   Maybe even a 5.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.580]   But isn't there a point--
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.100]   Unless they use Microsoft number.
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.620]   Is there a point where we're just shut up?
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.140]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:53.640]   Really?
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.140]   I mean--
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.540]   It's a cool name.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.100]   Well, now do you think they'd be OK and not, like,
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.300]   charging-- I mean, not trying to license it?
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.780]   You know what?
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.820]   I think that they looked at the droid advertisements that
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.020]   said, "Droid is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm Limited."
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.300]   And they said, hey, little dollar signs
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.980]   appeared in front of their eyes.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.260]   And they said, well, why don't we get a license for Nexus?
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.420]   Because really, it's a tribute to Philip K. Dick.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.580]   It's an Android operating system.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.020]   Of course they call it Nexus.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.980]   There's not a confusion here.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.580]   Nobody's not going to buy Do Androids Dream of Electric
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.420]   Sheep because there exists a phone called the Nexus 6.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:24.980]   Also, I don't think--
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.780]   And I know this is out on a legal limb.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.540]   But I don't think copyright allows you to essentially claim--
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.060]   does it allow you to claim every word that is in a book?
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.500]   I mean, really, like, if you invented a name for something
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:34.500]   in a book?
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.500]   You invented a name.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.060]   It's different than just using a word.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.780]   Well, it seems a little fuzzy to me.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.820]   It's pretty common for somebody like Lucasfilm or whatever
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.460]   to try and protect trademarks when the only reason they're
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.060]   doing it is because they have a trademark that is necessary.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.620]   I don't think Nexus 1 kind of fits that.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.100]   Well, I think LucasArts can make a claim, hey,
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.620]   we're out there merchandising things.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.780]   We make electronics.
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.820]   We put these things out there.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.100]   So this could hurt our business.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.060]   I don't see the Dick Estate doing that.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.140]   I don't see them.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.620]   This is why the hear you say Dick is still wanting to.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.100]   I know you don't want to.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.220]   Oh, we're all just children.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.420]   So what?
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:09.920]   I know.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.140]   It's a silly way.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.100]   OK, one more thing.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.380]   Zenny Jardin from Boing Boing had a great thread going
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.140]   on the day of the Nexus 1 with people making quotes from
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.580]   Blade Runner and playing off it with Nexus 1 things about the
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.700]   phone and how it worked.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.420]   And that was great stuff for the Philip K. Dick Estate.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.620]   I'm sure they sold a lot of books as a result.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.140]   They may get greedy at Dick Estate.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:33.820]   No, get--
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.820]   And title.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.260]   Make sure those words are in the right hand, pay the plug.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.260]   It's all that you're getting into.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.500]   You're looking for the title already.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.020]   I like that.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.740]   I like that for the title.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.180]   That's my nominee for so far.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.500]   We're going to keep working on it, though.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.860]   3D televisions were a big story here.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.500]   Really?
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.780]   I hadn't heard much about that.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.300]   Yeah, but I was surprised by some things I saw.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:53.820]   You liked it.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.620]   For the televisions.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.220]   Well, for a saw, I thought I'd hate it.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.140]   So I had low expectations.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.460]   And I went in and I did think that the quality of what I
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.660]   was seeing was actually consistent with what I saw in a
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.740]   movie theater.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.300]   But the thing that really got me was when you combined it
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.380]   with the gesture control, with the cell at Toshiba.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.820]   Oh, you thought that was cool?
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.340]   Well, I just-- I knew it was out there for a while, and they
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.140]   never gave it to us.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.060]   But there's a good reason.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.980]   How long did you watch?
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.420]   Did you go through a couple of those demos?
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.780]   Only about half the time was she able to get it to do what
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.620]   she wanted to do.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:25.820]   Oh, really?
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.260]   She had a very good pattern.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.460]   So the idea is, it looks like Natale, where she's waving
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.820]   her hands, and there's this 3D globe on the screen, and
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.900]   she's spinning it like minority report, and spinning it left.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.580]   But then, frequently, she'd say things, well, let's just
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.860]   take a tour through the content.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.700]   It was clear that the globe had a mind of its own.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.740]   Or, well, can't they fix that?
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.140]   Yeah, but it's demo.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.100]   Well, that's the thing it seemed like.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.100]   I really want that.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.340]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.740]   Right now, controls are the big problem with all these
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.740]   machines that we put in our--
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.980]   So maybe she'd just be intuitive.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.780]   She'd go like this.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.700]   Well, either that-- I mean, look, we all want voice
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.300]   recognition.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.900]   We all want simple things.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.260]   We all want all-in-one remotes.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.140]   And nothing ever does the trick.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.860]   So I just want them to try something else, and maybe I
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.500]   can get there.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.100]   That was one of the announcements Steve Balmer made in his
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.460]   thrilling gripping speech on Wednesday night.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.780]   My favorite part was the power outage.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.540]   Is this a peaceful--
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.060]   After a--
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.340]   It was kind of like a rain delay.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:18.860]   Really?
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.140]   They practically had the outage.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:20.700]   It was like, very bad news.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.980]   The guy with the tarp come and roll the tarp's over the
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.580]   seats over Balmer's head.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.140]   And they started showing Hogan's heroes reruns.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.860]   And then, finally, they started.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.100]   And yeah, the whole speech was reruns, basically.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.580]   But one thing you did say is, Natala's coming this year.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.180]   That's the Microsoft gaming stuff that made Veronica look
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.460]   so silly going like this.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.820]   Well, it's going to make everybody look silly.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.740]   You know what?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.940]   Adorably silly.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.260]   Look, just try new things as often as possible.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.700]   We get locked in a rut.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.500]   I don't care if they're silly or embarrassing.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.220]   You're refreshing breath of fresh air.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.180]   Usually, we're just a bunch of cormogen's going, that sucks.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:19:59.700]   What's next?
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.420]   Well, I want more things that suck.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.300]   Because if I get more things that suck, eventually, I
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.380]   will get something awesome.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.300]   No, you're right.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.100]   Let them try stuff.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:07.620]   Let them try.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.820]   That's the argument for the late adopter, right?
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.900]   You always buy like three-year-old technology.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.100]   Everything works great.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.020]   It's fast.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.100]   It's perfect.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:15.580]   That's right.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.100]   So--
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.100]   Oh, gee, introduce some motion remote that I thought was
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.780]   actually pretty cool.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.620]   It was just somewhere where--
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.260]   It works like a Wii.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.980]   It works like a Wii want so that when you want to get to
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.220]   different quadrants of the screen.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.820]   And I thought this to me was the best sort of iteration,
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.460]   because it doesn't have as many potential bugs.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.220]   It's just like, wave your hands in the air.
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.380]   Because you just kind of go, like, OK, I want my cursor to
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.220]   be over here now.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:32.700]   Duke.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.140]   That would work a little bit better.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.180]   But even the Wii, don't you find a little difficult to
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.060]   navigate with the Wii you want and get it to do what you
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:39.260]   want.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.620]   It's hard to get it to get--
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.620]   It's not very precise.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.120]   Right.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.660]   What about the voodoo controller?
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.900]   Did you guys ever use that one?
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.500]   It's a handheld that it has a little bit of a motion
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.220]   component to it.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.340]   I kind of like that.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.860]   Motion is OK.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.940]   I'm going to give you that, Jay.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:53.900]   It's OK.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.940]   Let them keep working on it.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.860]   It's early days yet.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.980]   This one went ahead a camera.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.900]   The Toshiba had a camera aimed at you.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.660]   Part of what they were showing off, though, was the fact
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.660]   this is a TV with 8 3.2 gigahertz processors in it, the
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.820]   IBM Cell processor.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.180]   Which IBM is canceled, by the way.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.180]   So--
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:08.540]   Really?
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.220]   So it's kind of a--
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.380]   So that $11,000 TV is very absolutely--
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:12.380]   OK.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.380]   --is weird.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.940]   That's like when the people planning CES six months ago
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.860]   kind of get there and go.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.220]   Do you think people aren't going to remember that?
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.860]   And it had the 2D to 3D conversion.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.900]   No, right, definitely no.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.780]   They had up conversion.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.420]   Up conversion, 2D to 3D.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.060]   They also had up conversion of 2K to 4K, which didn't look
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:27.580]   all that good.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.900]   And 2D to 3D didn't look great.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.140]   But it was an interesting idea.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.060]   I actually talked to a guy who's a graphics expert about how
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.740]   do they do that.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.140]   And he said, the only way you can do it is with edge
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:37.580]   detection.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.420]   If stuff is soft-focus, if there's a shallow depth of
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.180]   feel, and stuff is out of focus, where you presume that's
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.060]   in the background, of course, that's not going to work.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.980]   If the focal point is in the middle, and there's stuff in
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.620]   the foreground out of focus, it's going to push it to the
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.540]   back.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.540]   So it's going to have some weird effects.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.140]   That's right.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:54.620]   I don't know.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.820]   I personally gave me a headache after a certain amount of
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:57.900]   time.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.020]   And my big issue with all of the 3D stuff, I'll just be
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.500]   honest with you.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.660]   You're sitting and watching this great football game, having
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.580]   that immersive experience.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.780]   And you turn to your buddy, and he's wearing those glasses.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.740]   I know.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.140]   What are you going to get the gunners?
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.180]   What, so are you.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.900]   And it's not going to be like--
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.660]   And your buddy's looking at you going like, man, your
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.860]   nose looks hilarious, right?
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.620]   We both look like idiots.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.660]   At least no one can see us looking like idiots, because
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.420]   we're in the privacy of our own.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.900]   Except then, they're getting the stylish glasses.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.140]   No.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.260]   I don't care how stylish they are.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.500]   You're still wearing dorky glasses.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.260]   And they have batteries.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.260]   And how many pairs of those?
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:30.900]   And they have batteries.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.420]   What's going to happen when the battery wears out?
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.900]   And it's like some funky, weird battery.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.500]   And then you're sitting there in your house wondering, OK,
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.300]   do I have to try to--
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:37.860]   Well, you buy new glasses.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.660]   Plus, you know those batteries are going to explode
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.500]   like the laptop ones.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.260]   I'm just saying--
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:41.700]   Oh, that's good.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.100]   --on your head, scalpers.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:43.900]   Into your eyes.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.260]   I presume that you could flip a switch and turn off the 3D
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.180]   and watch it in 2D.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.020]   I mean, that's a good point.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.260]   These TVs got to be able to do 2D, too, right?
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:51.580]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.820]   They will, of course not.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.420]   I'm not-- I just--
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.260]   I hate to say it, and I don't want to be the curmudgeon
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.900]   grouch about it, but I'm not wearing those glasses at home.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.860]   I'm not doing it.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.060]   I want to lay on the couch and put my head on the pillow.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.660]   And I am not going to keep 10 or 11 pairs of glasses around
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.140]   for when I want to have a party for the Super Bowl
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.140]   or for the Academy of War and Plan.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.140]   Right.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.700]   That's going to be like a new box that you check on.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.220]   You invite.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.500]   No, mark my words.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:12.980]   Don't forget your goggles.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.580]   Within a year, Oakley is going to have the Oakley active shutter.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.260]   Well, I got it right.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.260]   Gunted with this, yeah.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.100]   But actually, I think by next year,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.020]   we're going to see them rolling out the 3D TVs that
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.060]   don't require glasses.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.340]   I mean, I think then you're going to start--
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:24.860]   They can't.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.420]   They're starting to do displays that like stimulate 3D already.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.820]   You can't see from the side, though.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.580]   That's the big problem.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.580]   Yeah, but you kind of can't with 3D glasses either.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.500]   They have the display.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.580]   With the shutter ones you can't.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.100]   Oh.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.580]   They have the display.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.740]   But the problem is if you watch it longer than three minutes,
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.420]   you do vomit.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.660]   So that's a bummer.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.180]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:40.700]   OK.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.180]   Well, it's OK.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.180]   It's OK.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.700]   It's a hard one.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.100]   But you said you want a new stuff that might suck.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.300]   Well, that's true.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   It's good.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.420]   It's a good technology for certain applications,
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.740]   but I just can't allow myself to get set.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:55.620]   I'm not buying 3D.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.700]   Some of them aren't there.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.220]   Avatar.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.060]   Come on.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:58.780]   That was awesome.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.260]   I think Avatar would have been better in 2D.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.420]   I was just as good in 2D.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.380]   Oh, I'm not sure.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.460]   I'm just making things on now.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.220]   Did you just watch it in 2D in television?
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.180]   No, I watched it in 3D.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.940]   And I kept saying, god, I wish this room two days.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.980]   Seriously.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.540]   Don't you think--
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.380]   I heard people say that.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.180]   But it's exhausting.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.260]   It's exhausting to sit there and have that sort of stimulus.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.340]   It takes you out of the movie.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.020]   It would have been a bit.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.540]   Trust me, watch it at home when it comes out.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.460]   No, wait, wait, wait.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.020]   But did you go to iMacs or regular?
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:19.540]   Regular.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.940]   OK, because I think the regular size film 3D, for me,
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.900]   was a better experience than my friends who
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.300]   went to see iMacs 3D.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.340]   Well, iMacs even takes you out of it more.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.300]   Well, I saw iMacs 3D and loved it.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:31.700]   Loved it.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.460]   And I had a little bit of a better time at the beginning.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.100]   But after I'd watched it for 20 minutes, I was in.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.300]   I had no problems.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.820]   Most importantly, I looked at my daughter
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.340]   and my son, who was sending XMe.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.460]   And their minds were blown.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.860]   And I was totally worth that.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.300]   Ever.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.220]   It's a great movie.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.260]   It would have been better in 2D.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.340]   The griff points out-- remember, in 1978,
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.820]   what was the big story of CES quadriphonic sound?
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:53.820]   OK.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.540]   We've been here, done that.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.860]   I actually think 3D is going to be in every TV.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.500]   I think it's just going to be a thing that's in there.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.620]   And you could not use it like you say or use it.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.340]   It's not that much more expensive to make the TV do 3D.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.660]   And so I think that's why we're seeing it explode so fast.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.780]   Because they're like, you know what?
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.660]   It's not that hard.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.020]   Well, good.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.700]   And it makes people want to buy our TV
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.660]   because it comes with 3D, even if they're not going to use it.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.820]   It's really just iterative.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.660]   And then let's not forget that a couple of these manufacturers,
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.020]   let's not name names, LG, really, all they did
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.540]   was slap a slide into their press conference power points,
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.180]   the basically said.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.180]   And also, we are also going to do the 3D this year.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.260]   Because all of a sudden, they kind of
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.940]   got wind of the fact that 3D was going to be the big thing
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.380]   at the show.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.340]   And Panasonic is the only one with a ship date.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.060]   You know who did something stupid?
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.020]   It's sharp.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.300]   Sharp announced red, green, blue, yellow TV.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.300]   No, no, no, no.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.540]   Red, green, blue, yellow TV.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.260]   Not CMYK.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.140]   No, red, green, blue, yellow TV's.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.300]   And they kept showing yellow tubas that looked--
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.180]   Well, yellow.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.140]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.140]   There's a real problem.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.220]   I mean, what it did is it enhanced the color space.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.700]   But I was talking to our home theater expert.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.020]   He said, yeah, you have a broader color gamut,
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.460]   but you don't want a broader color gamut.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.020]   There's an established, defined color gamut for television.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.020]   And you want to stick to the standard.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.660]   You don't want to invent some standard.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.100]   It doesn't make-- you want accurate color reproduction.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.540]   And adding a fourth channel does nothing.
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.140]   So that was a very strange move.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.900]   I mean, let's put it this way.
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.380]   They're completely capable of doing something stupid,
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.580]   even if they do it in a concert.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.100]   Oh, totally.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.860]   So just like I said, the more stupidity is better.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.620]   Well, eventually somebody's going to hit the ball out of the park.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.140]   Jay Adleson, ladies and gentlemen, more stupidity is better.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:28.940]   Let's take a break.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.660]   I do want to talk about the best of CES.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.620]   So we'll get there.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.740]   We'll get there right after this moored from the folks
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.940]   at Citrix who do the Go to Meeting product.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.300]   Go to Meeting actually would have saved us a lot of money.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.100]   We should have just stayed at home and used Go to Meeting
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.100]   to go to Comda.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.020]   How long before CES is done that way with internet meetings?
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.580]   The whole point to go to meeting is you do more.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.380]   You travel less.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.780]   Anytime you're on the phone with somebody
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.260]   and you've got a PowerPoint presentation, a spreadsheet,
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.900]   maybe some slides you want to show.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.260]   And all you have to do is say, look, here's--
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.020]   I want to show you this.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.340]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.060]   Click Join a meeting.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.900]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.100]   Now they're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.980]   They're seeing that PowerPoint.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.580]   They're seeing the spreadsheet, the slides, the websites.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.180]   And it's engaging.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.580]   It's dramatic.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.300]   It makes you more effective.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.260]   And it's a great way to have meetings.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.820]   And best of all, it costs you a whole lot less than flying
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.220]   around the country to have your meetings.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.420]   I want you to go to go to meeting.com/twit right now.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.900]   g-o-t-o, meeting.com/twit.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.500]   You could sign up for 30 days free.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.140]   I'm not selling you a pig in a pock.
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.140]   It's going to cost you nothing.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.580]   You can at least try it out.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.660]   Call your clients, your colleagues.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.940]   Show the boss.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.580]   Say, look, this is-- what do you think about this?
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.820]   Would you think this will save us money?
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.300]   I think we get more done with this.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.300]   I guarantee you.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.380]   They'll say yes.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.300]   Do more, travel less, easy to set up.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.180]   Just take you a minute or two.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.540]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.500]   Thank you so much for their support of our travel down here.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.900]   I think it's kind of ironic in a way
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.260]   that they pay for us to come all the way here,
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.140]   where we could have just done it with go to meeting.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.940]   So seeing that every year does the best of CES you've been doing.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.060]   Actually, I think you guys took over for Tech TV, right?
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:05.500]   We did.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.540]   Well, G4TechTV did it for the last time in 2005.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.420]   And then we took it over in 2006.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.580]   And we've been doing it a much better job, frankly,
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.580]   than even Tech TV did.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.060]   That used to be Fisticuffs in that room.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.580]   We're trying to figure out what the best is.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.080]   Right.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.380]   Now, there's a Fisticuffs in our room.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.380]   Let me just run through some of the winners
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.300]   in the Tech TV days.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.060]   Well, there was the Danger Sidekick.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.860]   The communicator.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.980]   And my favorite, the Moxie.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.500]   Big winner.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   Right, I forgot about that.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.060]   I love Moxie.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.540]   Well, it was a great product.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.580]   Never really went anywhere.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.940]   In fact, just declared bankruptcy this year.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.740]   That's the yes and the nutshell.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.180]   It really is, isn't it?
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.100]   I mean, because you don't see all the products
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.060]   that are going to come out in the year.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.500]   And there's things like Photokina and CTIA.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.100]   So you don't see all the products in every category,
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.780]   necessarily.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.300]   And there's a lot of--
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:51.620]   I don't know.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.780]   The best of is not necessarily the best.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.260]   But it's the best of CES.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.940]   It's not necessarily the best products of the year.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.100]   I do like the two that you picked.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.380]   Let's start with the television.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.060]   The Panasonic VT25 Plasma TV.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.580]   Why did you guys pick that?
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.180]   Well, the main reason is because, like I said,
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.180]   that's the only 3D TV with a ship date, I think, in some ways.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:08.680]   Really?
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.140]   Are you kidding?
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.500]   I love all the TVs in here.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.820]   None of them have ship dates.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.540]   I'm pretty sure that is going to be the first one.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.220]   There may be a few more, but most of them don't.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.420]   I think that's the only one.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.140]   It's not a firm date.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.300]   They've all got like, you know, summer and this and that.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.700]   And Panasonic's got a firm date.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.200]   It's got a date.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.140]   And it's a really good TV.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.060]   It's a really good TV.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.300]   The display looks very good.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.100]   I love Panasonic Plasma TV.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.780]   We didn't give it because it has 3D.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.060]   It's that sort of a sideline.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.660]   It's just-- we love the TV.
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.100]   It's got internet connectivity.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.340]   I think it's a great picture.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.380]   I think a couple of things there.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.220]   It's interesting that it's plasma not LCD,
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.060]   because everybody's buying LCD these days.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.260]   And it's a lower power drawing plasma.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.700]   Much lower than cutting half.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.260]   I love the internet connectivity.
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.540]   It really is a big deal.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.300]   No.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.620]   Come on, Mr. IPTV.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.540]   You better--
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:47.980]   It is.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.420]   I'm a big fan of being able to watch stuff.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.500]   But I think that the software that drives my consumption
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.100]   is better with another product.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.860]   You like Roku or Boxybox?
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:58.860]   I'm a Boxybox.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.260]   Did you see the Boxybox?
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.980]   I love Boxy.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.980]   Did you see the Boxybox?
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.480]   I did.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.340]   I saw the Boxybox.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.940]   Do you want to wish that it was just a box?
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.740]   I do.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.460]   Instead of a box or the corner?
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.060]   Cut off?
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:08.980]   Yeah, like a little rear.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.100]   OK, that's a little weird.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:10.700]   I don't know.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.620]   But it almost doesn't matter, because then I look at the TV.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.380]   And it just--
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.500]   So for people who don't know--
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.460]   And Boxy's on it.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.780]   For people who don't know, what is Boxy?
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.700]   Boxy?
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.140]   I can--
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.700]   Jay, go ahead.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.900]   You're obviously a Boxy lover.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.060]   Do the thing.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.140]   Well, first of all, Boxy, I believe,
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.300]   is based on the original Xbox media center.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:26.800]   Xboxy.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.700]   Yeah, it's open source.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.300]   It's based on XCMC.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.060]   That's right.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.980]   And it's a software program that you can either download
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.340]   and install yourself, or with this D-Link Boxybox,
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.900]   and have next year television.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.980]   And basically, it makes internet video everything--
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.660]   all the media on the internet consumable on your television.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.580]   And it's as far as I'm using--
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.580]   Revision 3, including--
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.580]   Including all--
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.860]   Including all-- you know, seeing everything.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.500]   It's all there.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.420]   They have applications that can be installed on Boxy.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.940]   So you can actually have--
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.540]   Sorry.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.300]   You can actually have applications
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:03.060]   that dig and Revision 3 and Twit that allow you
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.660]   to consume it very easily.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.780]   And as far as I'm concerned, the gracefulness of the UI
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.780]   is the key.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.300]   And I've seen some really good UIs over the last couple
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:13.820]   of years.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.060]   I love the Voodoo stuff.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.780]   And I absolutely think that Roku--
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.340]   I mean, there's good stuff.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.940]   But Boxy, for me, and maybe it's because I'm
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.420]   a internet nerd, I thought was really great.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.780]   Which I'm not going to--
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.940]   I don't think I'm going to get in the internet televisions
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.940]   for your earlier point.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.300]   I was talking to Boxy about that.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.020]   I was like, you've got this box.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.980]   And you guys are talking about doing other boxes.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.940]   Do you want to be on TVs?
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.060]   And they said, absolutely.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.900]   We would like to make some deals with television manufacturers
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.460]   and get Boxy as an embedded system.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.620]   So you buy a TV and it comes with Boxy.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.500]   If that happens, then your internet television now,
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.380]   to me, makes sense.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.340]   Because you know what you're getting now, basically?
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.180]   Like, it's true.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.620]   The Viracast platform, right?
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.100]   That's the one that runs on Panasonic.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.980]   And it does have some good connectivity options.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.780]   But for the most part, it's kind of like the difference
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.860]   between Vcast and iPhone OS.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.060]   It's a very proprietary UI.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.260]   It's a proprietary system.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.180]   It's tightly controlled in terms of what widgets you get
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.300]   and what actual programming you get.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.420]   And Boxy gives you basically all web video.
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:10.820]   Opens it off.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.820]   So you prefer to go who widgets or any of the other built-in TV.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.140]   Yahoo, widgets is another very common TV platform.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:18.900]   That's almost like the thing they do.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.860]   And it's fairly open.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.180]   Yeah, but it's almost like that's the thing they do just
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.140]   to show that they have it.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.820]   I mean, they're not going to stream all of the video
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.260]   from the web.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.220]   They're not going to have that really sort of, like I said,
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.020]   elegant interface.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.940]   So Boxy, you can download.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.260]   You can put it on your computer.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.260]   You can run it on an Apple TV if you hack it.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.380]   There's a lot of things you can do it.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.540]   But they've now done a deal with D-Link
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.260]   to make a cube that has a corner cut off and sits funny.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.060]   And an HDMI port.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.740]   And it has the Boxy software.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.220]   It's an ethernet port or Wi-Fi.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.020]   I think it's a more Wi-Fi, right?
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.540]   And it has an optical audio.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.180]   It's a little pricey.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.460]   It's $200, right?
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.900]   Yeah, but when you compare that to the other boxes,
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.580]   the top boxes, it's kind of in the range.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.660]   It's a little more than a Roku, though.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.500]   Roku's $29.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.340]   The Roku's $99 now.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.020]   Yeah, really?
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.140]   Roku's a pretty killer price.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.340]   Roku is--
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.300]   But Roku to Boxy-- I mean, Roku is very utilitarian.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.500]   Everybody should have a Roku.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.020]   Period.
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:09.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.020]   It's too cheap.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.500]   It's very utilitarian.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.740]   It's too cheap not to have.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.580]   But Boxy's so elegant.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.420]   And even the design is kind of elegant.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.180]   I don't think it's up to you.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.260]   Well, there's also a pop box.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.660]   From pop, or a pop bar came out.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.100]   And they are starting to get--
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.980]   there's somebody to watch because they
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.620]   are getting a slick on the interface side as Boxy.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.380]   And on the technology side, they've always been sorry.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.020]   OK, Geek trivia.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.180]   Where's the name Boxy come from?
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.420]   Oh, I have no idea.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.340]   Why do the Android dog on Battlestar--
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.900]   Oh, it's after Boxy.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.860]   It's after Boxy.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.220]   I think that's-- well, think of the logo.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.660]   The Boxy logo's a little dog.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.460]   The daggot.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.180]   That makes sense.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.220]   Daggot, right?
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.420]   Yeah, very good.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.620]   Wow, well done.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.540]   OK, no, I--
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.300]   Chadram told me that.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.180]   Where's my daggot?
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:46.940]   I'm just now.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.060]   If you go to the Boxy-- or to the D-Link booth,
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.220]   or the NVIDIA booth, they're demoing it.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:56.780]   And I noticed that they won't show YouTube videos in the booth.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.460]   Because I guess they're worried about copyright.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:58.900]   Oh, really?
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.260]   Or will you shut the Boxy down?
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.540]   There's a back and forth with Hulu.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.900]   They don't want to be on Boxy.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.260]   Well, that--
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.060]   Which is again--
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.900]   The one drawback.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.420]   Typical Murdoch BS.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:06.900]   This guy--
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.900]   That makes sense.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.620]   I don't get the hell out of it.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.580]   You can maybe still get Hulu if you try.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.380]   I didn't find that.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.300]   You might be able to.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.780]   Yeah, it's a little bit of work, but it might be possible.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.740]   Yes, I would not condoning any.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:19.300]   No.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:19.820]   No.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.300]   No.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.180]   Although you can dig things, did you notice?
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.220]   Just want to point out.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.380]   You can dig from Boxy?
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.220]   There's a dig app, and you activate it.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:26.580]   That's awesome.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.020]   You can actually dig the video.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.140]   That's when it opens up.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:29.660]   Oh, really?
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.220]   That's really smart.
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.700]   Well, Boxy already has social media in it.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.500]   I mean, that's really kind of part of the fun of it.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.900]   You can Facebook share it.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.340]   I think that that's the future of everything.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.260]   All right, so the VT-25, I think we'll agree.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.140]   That's a great TV.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.180]   And I think a very good pick.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.380]   It's a credible pick.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.700]   And I'm not disagreeing a little bit with Jay.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.180]   I thought the Boxy was wrong.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.500]   Yeah, really the Boxy should have won.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.100]   Boxy was the best to show.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.660]   So we were like, well, Boxy wasn't in the same category as the TV.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.140]   It's a different--
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:53.660]   Yeah, it's a different--
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.160]   I don't know.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.220]   The TV is a little--
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.140]   Oh, yeah, maybe not best.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.940]   --a mundane pick, though, because there are a lot of great TVs.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.780]   Well, I think it says something about CES
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.900]   that it was sort of a compromise pick, where nothing at this show stood out.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:09.420]   Like the Palm pre last year stood out and said, hey, this is something really
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.260]   revolution.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.580]   And your computer hardware pick, though, did stand out, I thought, quite a bit.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.820]   The idea pad.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:15.820]   And that was the one--
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.340]   The U1 from Lenovo, the idea pad U1.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.060]   Apparently, our best in show voting was super close.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.340]   And I think that it was between the idea pad and that TV, because that is just--
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:25.860]   Well, they both--
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.340]   So clever.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:26.340]   --so clever.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.420]   --in their own category.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.460]   They each won their own category.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:28.940]   And wait a minute.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.740]   Tell me about this.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.740]   Oh, jeez.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.860]   Oh, this is amazing.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.500]   You're going to buy it right away.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.300]   It's a netbook, but then you actually can undock it.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.500]   So it's a netbook running Windows 7, and you can undock the display.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:46.380]   And then the display becomes just on the fly, like hot, swappable, a slate, tablet running
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:46.880]   Linux.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.380]   And then--
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.660]   --blue dog Linux tablet with a real simple interface for photos, video, web surfing.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   Multi-touch interface.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.660]   Wow.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.540]   And then you redock it, and it syncs your browser, and then just switches back to Windows 7 on
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.540]   the fly.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.540]   Oh, that's pretty cool.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:02.540]   And also, it's gorgeous.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.540]   It's gorgeous.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.540]   It's gorgeous.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:04.540]   It's gorgeous.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.540]   And snaptragons.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.540]   So it's good.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.540]   I mean, in battery life, 10 hours.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.540]   A real 10 hours.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.540]   And it is beautiful.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.380]   The base continues to run when you pull the tablet out.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.020]   So you can actually hook that up to a monitor and have two computers running at the same
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.020]   time.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   Yes.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.020]   And then you can pull it over here.
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.860]   For the low, low price of--
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.540]   Under $1,000 was all they would say.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.540]   They would give me a full price.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.540]   Not $99.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.540]   Not $99.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.260]   And it's funny, because it's the size of a netbook, but it's 3 and 1/2 pounds.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.180]   So it actually feels a little heavy.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.180]   Now, a little bit.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.180]   But you know what?
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.220]   The fact that you can just pull that thing off was so magical.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.220]   I loved it.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   It's beautiful design.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.620]   That's the thing about true innovation in the--
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.620]   I feel like frickin'--
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.500]   --in the what's his name, where it felt like magic.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.500]   Like it was so--
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.500]   Much beautiful.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   --you know.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.500]   I like it when things actually work.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.900]   You can do another thing, and then you can touch it, and then put the thing back on the
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.900]   thing.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.420]   Because I was kind of skeptical until I actually picked it up, and I pulled it out.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.060]   And in like-- it was a flash.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.780]   It flipped the tablet, started running.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.460]   I was like, this actually runs.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.460]   It's not just a concept.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.460]   Oh, look at that.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.860]   I also like it that even when you detach the top, there's still like this Plexiglas shell.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.860]   And it's so pretty.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:04.860]   I think that's a nice touch, actually.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.860]   It really is.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.500]   And then you don't have kind of a keyboard with that.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.940]   It looks like you broke it.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   Right.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.940]   You know.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.940]   I think this is very interesting.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.020]   And also, by the way, the Snapdragon processor was everywhere.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.820]   It's in everything, including the new phone.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:23.340]   That is an ARM processor, gigahertz ARM processor, that has enough power that a lot of people
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.860]   are using in CE devices.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.700]   I think it's one of the big stories here, is that high-powered chips are now becoming
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.620]   so easily widely available that you can see them in cars.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.300]   You can see them in CE devices.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.500]   And I think that transforms everything.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.980]   You know, the voice recognition in sync is powered by nuance, which does the--
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.980]   Right.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.860]   And I asked them, and they said, I said, this is-- how do you do this in a car?
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.780]   He said, well, because the car is practically your PC's now.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.700]   They have enough horsepower and they have enough ram in them that we can really do challenging
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.060]   applications like voice recognition.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.300]   The other one that almost won Best of Show and won in its category for Card Tech was
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.420]   my Ford Touch, which we talked about a lot earlier.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.420]   Right.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.660]   It was a real close contender.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.660]   I think this should have won.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.100]   I don't know if you guys nominated it.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.780]   This was a very interesting product.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.780]   It was.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.860]   There were a lot of e-book readers out there.
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:14.220]   It was the copia that you mentioned, which has kind of a kindle with social networking.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.220]   That's--
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:20.380]   But this one, the entourage page looked a lot like that career video that was on dig a
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.780]   while back that was a Microsoft concept product.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:29.620]   It was a two-page e-book reader, the left page e-ink, the right page, a computer, and
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.100]   you could drag from one to the other.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:35.540]   You could have a real computer on one side and a real e-book reader on the other side.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.780]   I found the e-book reader really laggy in the one that I tried.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:43.060]   Yeah, they made-- the prototypes they were showing around did not have the snapdragon,
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.060]   the full snapdragon, 700 records.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.460]   So maybe it'll be faster.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.660]   It's a couple of things that were interesting.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.420]   First of all, it was a big e-book page.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.940]   It was an almost a 10-inch page.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.660]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.740]   And they put a Wacom digitizer on top of it.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.100]   So you could draw on it.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.500]   Although the drawing, again, was a little clunky.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.500]   They had to get the speed.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.620]   The drawing on the plastic logic cube, I thought, was the best that I tried.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.900]   Is it an e-ink screen as well?
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.900]   It's an e-ink screen.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.220]   You don't have to use a stylus or anything.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.380]   So it's not an issue of e-ink.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.380]   This one I'm wondering.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.380]   Is it a processor or is it an e-ink?
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.140]   It must be a processor, I think.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.580]   Because you were able to draw on the plastic logic pretty fast.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.980]   But can we get back to know the killer app of these things is reading books on them?
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.980]   Right.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.980]   And just get a Kindle.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.980]   Well, that's right.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.420]   I mean, because it has to feel like it goes away.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.420]   Kindle feels like a book.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.900]   Yeah, and that's the whole point of the Kindle.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   This does not go away.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.500]   Also, I have to say, given the reading factor, I find the spelling of that product unacceptable.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.260]   Oh, the inter-kept T-M-D-G.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.660]   That is just not-- that is-- no.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.980]   It's the entourage.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.180]   I actually think that I would not buy it because of that.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.180]   Product marketing, though.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.180]   I have issues.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.860]   That was in the portable media category.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.580]   And this is part of the thing that as we evolve, right?
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.420]   There's not really MP3 players anymore.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.260]   In fact, portable video players aren't really a big thing anymore.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.260]   No, why would you get one?
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.260]   So the e-books are in there.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.620]   But the tivet is the one that won the category.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.620]   It'd be the one.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.620]   It'd be the one.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.620]   The edge was a finalist.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:06.500]   The tivet is a tiny little module, like about maybe four times the size of a credit card
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.140]   or something that lets you do mobile DTV over Wi-Fi.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.420]   So it's the receiver for mobile DTV.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.780]   Kind of like a sling catcher?
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:19.580]   Well, it takes the broadcast mobile DTV, which is that separate broadcasting of digital
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.660]   television that they use for phones a lot.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.660]   Like the flow TV?
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.660]   It's similar to flow TV.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.660]   Yeah, similar to flow TV.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.220]   And it adds it to any device, including a phone or a portable media address.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.220]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.220]   Yeah, over a lot.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.100]   So that you can get 30-plus channels on your mobile phone.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.100]   And whatever there's more, what flow is.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.580]   What kind of flow is this model was?
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.060]   Flow sells a little tiny TV.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.700]   But really, they said that's just almost a prove that we could do it.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.660]   Really what we're doing is reselling this 700 megahertz television connectivity where
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.900]   we re-broadcast real-time live sports and stuff.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.820]   And you can get it on your phone, get it on other things.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.820]   Is it Vcast?
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.420]   Is it the same kind of technology?
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.820]   I think it's just different people doing it.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.660]   The TV cast was not using the DTV.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.660]   I don't think it's using this.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.660]   The TV broadcast.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.660]   The same one the Tivot is using.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.740]   No, but the thing about Tivot that's cool is it adds it to everything.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.740]   Right.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.740]   So T-I-V-L-R-T, am I sorry?
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.740]   T-I-V-I-T.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.780]   It's from a company called Valipse, V-A-L-U-P-S.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.780]   And how much is it going to be?
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.980]   It's a subscription thing.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.580]   So it doesn't really matter how much it's going to be.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.140]   It's a matter of how much it's going to cost a month, right?
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.140]   That's going to be the big issue.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.140]   We'll find out.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.140]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.140]   So it's pretty and it comes in college.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.140]   It's pretty.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.660]   So you can watch live TV on your mobile?
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.660]   No.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.540]   Well, there are very rare occasions.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.540]   And that's the problem.
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.340]   Like the Academy Awards and you're stuck in the subway or some game that you record
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.340]   in the DVR.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.340]   Okay, hold on.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.340]   I say no like that.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.340]   But you know what?
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.980]   I don't want to watch like lost on my, you know, I'd rather, you know, but I might want
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.300]   to watch a live event.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:59.300]   And I definitely watched, I was watching Blizzard Blizzcon on my phone while I was walking the
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.180]   dog because I had it on direct TV.
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.180]   Well, there you go.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.180]   It was using sling.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.180]   So yeah.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.180]   And I've watched a Twit on the Ustream.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.100]   Well, yeah, we're on mobile phone.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.900]   I'm sure all the revision three stuff is too.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.140]   So they say 90, 90 to $120.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.980]   No, I don't think there will be a subscription.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:14.980]   No monthly.
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.500]   It's just a broadcast.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.780]   It's basically an antenna.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.780]   Right.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.780]   I mean, it's just picking up a broadcast.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.780]   Oh, I get it.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.580]   So it's just a fancy antenna that goes in your pocket and has built in Wi-Fi.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.780]   So it's as slow as a rebroadcast service.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.100]   So you would have to pay a monthly fee because they're actually caching and rebroadcast.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:35.380]   But the advantage of Flow is they cache it so you can lose connectivity and it won't
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.380]   buffer.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.460]   I mean, it's almost like kind of buffering in the phone.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.460]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.460]   I can see.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.060]   I could see wanting to have, although you'd have to be a pretty big TV buff.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.060]   But I could definitely see it for news.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.780]   I mean, there's going to be those moments when you get to CNN breaking news alert.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.780]   How cool would it be?
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.540]   Don't we want it to Jay as an IPTV guys, don't we want to be everywhere?
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.540]   I mean, that's the idea.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.340]   I'd like to be on the big screen, but I'd also like to be on the little screen.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.460]   I want my tibit to work with my my Ford Touch-enabled car.
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:03.220]   Well, my thing is you you want to be when you're pulled over molly wood.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:07.620]   You want to be on something that someone already has, in my opinion, because asking
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.820]   people to carry more stuff is insane.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.820]   I know that's a problem.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:11.820]   Or even buying a tibit.
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.820]   I mean, it should just be part of what that's part of the service.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.820]   See, that's the problem with the glasses too.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:16.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:17.820]   More stuff.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.820]   Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.900]   I could just see all those 3D glasses gathering dust on a TV.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.900]   Oh, God.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.580]   The clutter factor alone makes me crazy.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.260]   And you got to buy more because if you have a family, big family, family gathering, people
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.260]   come over and you can't watch it.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.260]   No, it's not good.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.260]   And you need chargers.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.260]   I know.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.260]   And then your kids are going to break them.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.260]   Like my toddler, come on.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.260]   Do I have to go anywhere near those fancy Panasonic chargers?
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.860]   The tibit broadcasts over Wi-Fi to your device.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.780]   So can you use more than one device on one tibit?
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.780]   It's the funniest thing.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   Well, also I wonder, yeah.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.780]   Could you bare-boom a device?
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.140]   No, no, it's this little, little tiny mini Wi-Fi, right?
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.140]   Because it's your range.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.140]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.780]   The tibit is itself a station that it does a little bit of a zap over to your phone.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.940]   It probably has like a 1 millimeter range.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.140]   Otherwise, you know, people will be watching your TV.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.300]   Yeah, just start up a TV station and you're building.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.060]   You're listening to Twit, watching it too.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.980]   I hope at live.twit.tv with Molly Wood and Tom Merritt from CNET's Buzz Out Loud.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:15.540]   J Adleson from dig.com and we're going to have more of the news from the Consumer Electronics
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.460]   Show in Las Vegas and just a little bit before we do that.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.900]   I would like to mention my friends at audible.com.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.660]   Does anybody here listen to audiobooks?
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.660]   Anybody at all?
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.660]   Yes.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.660]   Yes.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.660]   Yes, yes.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.660]   Good.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.660]   All right.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.660]   Does it get to everyone?
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:35.100]   Well, it's funny because when we first started doing this years ago, it wasn't not that
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.380]   many people did, but I think now all geeks do some audiobooks because we all have little
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.380]   devices that we can listen.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.900]   I guess that kind of really confirms what we just said.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.860]   It's the kind of work on the device you got, right?
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:51.060]   And the idea, I just, I mean, to me, I would rather listen to an audiobook than watch television
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:56.140]   on my device because the picture that I see in my head is so much better than anything
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.060]   that I'm going to see, even on a big screen TV.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.180]   And that's what I love about audiobooks.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.180]   I read a lot.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.780]   The other thing I love is that I have a busy life and I don't get as much reading time
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.780]   as I'd like.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:10.140]   And if you are, you know, in the car and you're not reading or you're at the gym on the treadmill
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:16.140]   and you're watching Oprah, it probably add up all those times when you can't hold a book,
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.660]   but you've got some time to spare.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.300]   You're going to get two or three hours a day of reading.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.660]   Imagine the world that'll open up to you.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.220]   All the books, all the things you wanted to read, all the material you wanted to keep
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.100]   up and that's what Audible is so great for.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:34.700]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E, Audible.com, 65,000 titles, radio shows, comedy performances as well as
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:39.500]   books and books in every category, fiction and nonfiction and home improvement and self
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.540]   help and science fiction, the best collection of science fiction ever.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.740]   I know you're a certain laser you always are recommending when it's possible, an Audible
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:52.580]   version of the book because again, who has time to read, but we always have time to listen.
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:57.140]   Audible.com/twit2 is the URL if you'd like to sign up for the Platinum account and get
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:02.580]   two free books, Audible.com/twit the number two.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.140]   The Platinum account is two books a month.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.500]   It's the subscription plan I have.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.860]   I easily go through two books a month.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.500]   In fact, I know people, I've talked to people who have long commutes, they have two or three
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.500]   Platinum accounts because they go through two, four, six books a month.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.100]   Two is a good one to start with.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.100]   Two books a month.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.340]   First two books are yours, absolutely free.
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.780]   You can cancel at any time and you get to keep those books.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.180]   There's no cost, no obligation to you.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.100]   Go to Audible.com/twit2 and sign up for Audible today.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.700]   I think you're going to thank me for it later.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.260]   It really is a great way.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:31.700]   I think a lot of geeks are doing Audible.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:32.700]   I really do.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:36.580]   I think it's become the kind of in-fashioned thing to do is listen to audiobooks.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.500]   We all listen to podcasts.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.900]   You know what's interesting about audiobooks that I like is that you know exactly how long
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.500]   it's going to take you to finish the book.
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   That's a good point.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.500]   I never thought of that.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.620]   You can say, "Oh, I need to finish this by Tuesday for a discussion."
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.620]   Whatever.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.620]   You can schedule the time.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.620]   You can find me on the Fuster Wallis Infinite.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.140]   Just take me 15 years to read.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.060]   Some books just take longer than others, but in Audible you know.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.780]   I'm reading that on my Kindle which I find vaguely encouraging because it's like you're
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.780]   30 percent of the way there.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.780]   Those dots.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:02.980]   I don't have to look at page numbers.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.580]   I'm like 30 percent sounds like a lot.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:05.580]   That sounds good.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.580]   It works for me.
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:10.060]   I've read 10 times as much since I stopped being intimidated by the size of books.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.060]   That's a good point.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.060]   The Kindle they're all the same size.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.300]   I never, and then someone gave me the physical copy just as a supplement and I thought I
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.820]   never would have picked this one.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.820]   Cryptonomicon, you know.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.820]   Oh yeah.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:22.820]   The Baroque Cycle.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.820]   Don't even give me a start.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:24.820]   Oh.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.900]   We're not doing an ad at this point, but Cryptonomicon and Anitham are both on Audible and really
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.380]   good listens.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.740]   Those books will engage you in pulling away.
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:32.740]   I loved Anitham.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.740]   I thought that was such a good book.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   I thought that was a wonderful book.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.300]   I actually just pushed it on a friend of mine who normally doesn't read that kind of book
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.900]   and she texted me yesterday like, "I love this book."
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.900]   Well it's so strange.
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.380]   This is the newest Neil Stevenson novel.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.340]   He's got his snow crash and the Baroque Cycle which I never did finish.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.140]   I couldn't even get through the first one.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.140]   You loved it?
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.140]   I finished it.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.460]   That's because you're educated because I have nothing, no life.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.460]   He likes books that are just about knowing things which is basically...
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.460]   No.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.460]   There's like a tell that's all the books still for us.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.460]   No, it's interesting.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.460]   It's interesting stuff.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.020]   That stuff takes you someplace.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.020]   It takes you someplace.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.140]   I love though Anitham.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.980]   And what's funny is it's, at first it's a science fiction book and then it's a book about
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:12.180]   monks and it just goes all over the place.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.180]   But it engages you.
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.500]   It makes up a new language and you have to figure out what they're talking about.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.060]   But it somehow resonates.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.060]   He is a master.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.060]   That's it.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.420]   I love the sense of scale in that book.
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   The idea that humanity had progressed 5,000 years and that societies had come and gone.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.820]   It was just sort of this really like perspective inducing read.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.420]   Do you know what just came out?
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.420]   It's probably not an audible yet.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.940]   Is Daniel Suarez' freedom?
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.180]   It's the sequel to Demon.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.340]   Which I know Demon's unaudible.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.900]   But I don't know either book.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:38.900]   Oh, Demon is great.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:39.900]   Great.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.900]   You got to read Demon's.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:41.900]   You will love it.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:42.900]   Yes.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:49.980]   A guy who owned it, online gaming company dies and a demon goes off and starts investigating
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:50.980]   his death.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.980]   A demon?
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.060]   Yeah, like you know D-A-E-M-O-N.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.060]   A demon.
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.660]   Not just investigating his death though causing all, wreaking all kinds of havoc.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.580]   It's almost like a giant booby trap.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.740]   So it's like some weird kind of universe where demons exist?
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.740]   No, no, no.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.740]   It's an internet.
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.740]   It's a computer.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:07.740]   Oh, an internet game.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.740]   Computer.
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:15.460]   He starts using the network to investigate his death and start taking revenge and then
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.180]   start setting up a dark net.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.460]   Oh, I got to find out more about this.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.460]   Oh, it's fantastic.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.460]   This sounds exciting.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.460]   I don't know what I've walked into.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.860]   Weirdly, you seem to have walked into a book group.
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.860]   I'm not sure what happened.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:27.860]   It was a tech podcast.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:28.860]   It was.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:30.860]   It's funny.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.860]   No, it's about unlikely.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:33.860]   Sorry.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.860]   Dr. Kiki, she's been out on the shore floor all day.
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:35.860]   I have.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:36.860]   It's been so great.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:37.860]   So exciting.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:43.740]   No, we've been at CES for all four days of CES and doing kind of weird wacky stuff.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.740]   We've been streaming live.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.540]   We've been recording all the shows here.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.580]   And Dr. Kiki's been here as co-host, but she's also, we've got this crazy wireless rig
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.580]   that Colleen built.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:52.580]   That is so impressive.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.580]   It's so awesome.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.580]   Blown away by Colleen.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.580]   She's amazing.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.580]   Colleen's amazing.
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.580]   And it uses EVDO.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.820]   And it's just, but you weren't doing streaming.
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.020]   You were just recording, but we were using it to stream.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.260]   Yesterday we were doing live streaming from the show floor, rounding all around South Hall,
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.060]   upstairs South Hall, Center Hall.
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:11.100]   Today it's just been to tape, so no live stuff.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.700]   But we'll get all of that out on the feed.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.820]   In the next couple of days you'll see more and more stuff.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.460]   So if you go to twig.tv/ces, all of our coverage will be there.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.700]   And I think our goal was, it's funny.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.300]   I used to say this when we were at tech TV is to do virtual, a virtual trade show, but
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:31.420]   we were so tied to the form and the big lights and the big cameras and the stage that we
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.340]   couldn't really do what you do at a trade show.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.740]   And this wireless rig has let us walk around, go to parties.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:37.740]   It's been great.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.620]   I've been running around and we weave through the crowd and come up and interview people
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.940]   on the spot and it's a lot of fun.
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.820]   The listeners are actually at the show.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.820]   That was the goal.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.820]   The real experience without the foot pain.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:49.820]   The sweat.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:50.820]   Without the ad.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:55.340]   At home you can put your feet up and rest and relax, but here we are getting sore feet.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.340]   Yeah, we sure are you.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.340]   That's right.
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.340]   Who are you?
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.100]   Actually here, I'm going to go with Stepbrother, no pun intended.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.220]   We're getting permanent nerve damage for you.
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.940]   Some years after CES my little toe will be numb for like months.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:06.940]   That's right.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:11.380]   Tom and I were talking about this because every year you forget, it's like childbirth.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.580]   Otherwise, you'd never repeat it.
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:17.940]   Every year you forget how awful it was and you go back and with the highest of hopes,
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.580]   like, oh, I'm going to go see a show.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.580]   I'm going to go on a...
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:21.580]   But you know what it is?
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.380]   Sleep deprivation causes long term memory loss.
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.380]   Yes.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.380]   No, no, really.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.860]   That makes perfect sense.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:29.860]   That's actually really...
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.260]   I think that really is why you forget childbirth.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.260]   It doesn't have anything to do with the pain and the worry.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   It's that you're so tired.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.460]   It also explains why fathers are supportive, you know, because they're not obvious.
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.260]   Obviously, they're losing sleep too, right?
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.260]   Yeah, totally.
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.260]   So anyway...
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.260]   Otherwise, they would bolt.
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.260]   I don't know how we got it to turn them out.
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.260]   CES in the childbirth.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.260]   So we went from book group to mom's group.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.260]   And dad's group.
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:50.260]   And dad's group.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.260]   And let me tell you about the shoes I'm wearing.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.140]   Let's talk about shoes.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.540]   So did you see anything today, Kiki, that was interesting?
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.540]   Oh, I saw all sorts of things.
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.820]   A couple of my favorite things today.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.580]   The Panasonic booth.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.180]   I always love the earthquake booth behind us.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.180]   Which I don't know.
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.060]   You may hear it on the audio podcast.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.300]   I think it's rolling off on the video stream because it's about 20 Hertz.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.700]   I mean, it's as low as you can get.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:14.700]   It's all about...
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.700]   We're all getting a goodness eyes from it.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.700]   Great foot massage.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:22.380]   The Panasonic booth has a great eco section and that was something that I went through
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:27.740]   and took a look at their home fuel cell and their solar technology, their home energy
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:31.780]   management system that they've developed so that you know where you're using electricity
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:36.900]   and how you're losing it in various ways, how you're using it so that you can better
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.300]   and more effectively use your energy and lower your energy costs.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.100]   So that's something that's really cool.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.660]   Also far though, it's only available in Japan.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.260]   So we just have to wait for them to bring it over here.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:54.380]   And then there's a Fuji film, little 3D camera, handheld digital camera, 3D, 2D capability.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.380]   Okay.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.940]   Now I can make my own 3D movies.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:57.940]   Oh yeah.
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:00.940]   It does still in video photography and you can...
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.060]   The trick is it has these two lenses that are eye distance apart.
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.060]   Right.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.060]   That's what you need.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.060]   It has a stereoscopic.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.060]   That's cool.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.060]   Oh yeah.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.060]   Last year at eye stage, there was that 3D webcam.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.980]   I can't remember what it was called, but it had the two little eyeballs.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:13.980]   It's just cute.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:14.980]   It's cute.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.420]   I'm gonna feel so left out if everything goes 3D.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.420]   It's okay, don't worry.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.420]   It's not going to happen.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.420]   It's not going to happen.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.420]   It's not going to happen.
