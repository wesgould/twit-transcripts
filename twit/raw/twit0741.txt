[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.880]   I thought really honestly like it was like a hobbit about my height. He's a little tall
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.560]   Yeah, we had a big bear hug and everything. Oh, yeah, we did the event together. He's a really great guy

[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.800]   Okay, but first let's say hello to Mike y'all get in the country for a change are
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.440]   No mad or digital no man. I too have seen Andy a knock-o. He is
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.000]   His ears are really burning right now
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.200]   You were in Athens the last month
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.520]   Yeah, we were in Athens for months Spain for a month and we actually went to Armenia for a week and that was really cool
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.800]   Really had a good time. They went to a tech conference there fun. We're all the Armenian
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.520]   Tech stars were there they
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.680]   Don't believe I was gonna say unless she's there. Yes, of course Kim was there both there. You're kidding. No, I'm not
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.240]   Everybody with I was there. What's his name? Vaynerchuk was there Gary Vaynerchuk's Armenian fellow roost
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.880]   Extraction but close enough exactly
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.680]   Nice and we'll go to Mexico on Tuesday. So this is a brief interlude to visit princess squishy
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.120]   Exactly some squishy time and squishy face time. I like that squishy face time
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.440]   And more importantly the great box la vah
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.600]   Then you know what Costco has great baklava. I just have to say I can tell you where to get I'm gonna be in Athens tomorrow
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.040]   Yeah, I am I think I probably should not eat that I haven't had any sugar since February and I think I would die
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   You could this is the quickest way to be like
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.960]   It would be a good death. It would be a good death. It would be a years with a sugar in one slice of it's right
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.040]   Yeah, I would like that a dress
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.040]   There's no sugar and well, there's probably a little sugar, but it's mostly honey. This is a false to stay exactly
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.560]   Seth Rosenblatt is also here security guru editor-in-chief at the parallax th e dash parallax dot com. Hi Seth. Hello. Welcome back
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   Nobody's called me a guru before
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.760]   Well, I don't even have the face you get some merchandise
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.400]   I'm sure like doing, you know retreats with people. I've been told to go to the top of a mountain before
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   And stay stay yeah
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.760]   Well down you have your ashram has a garage. We know that much the ashram does have a garage the bat cave is garage enabled
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.520]   Actually, I wanted to talk to Mike Elgin because yesterday you tweeted. Thanks, California. You just put me out of work
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.440]   Yes, are you out of work? Oh, okay?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.780]   So I heard about this of course where I learned about everything on a twit podcast. I was listening to
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.240]   Twi it a B5
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.200]   Yes, and they were saying oh this there's this new thing that's supposed to bring uber driver
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   and with drivers into these
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.800]   realm of
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.320]   unionized civilized mankind and by the way that you're not they're not gonna let freelance writers
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.680]   Submit more than 30 something 35
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:26.360]   I'm like are you out of your mind like that's what I do for living signed into law in September
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.640]   It becomes the law of the state on January 1 yeah among a lot of other laws including the new California
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.680]   Privacy bill the IOT security bill the legislature got very active this year
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.160]   But just thank God weed is legal because I you know
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.360]   Yeah, so the I
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.120]   I'm gonna speak here on behalf of the state legislature my wife. I'm an employer. Yes my wife is an employer
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.360]   She hates the California state legislature
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   Oh, this is making it hard for employers, but the theory behind this is
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.120]   That a lot of businesses will use independent contractors to avoid paying
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.920]   Benefits yes, and so they designate you you're writing let's say you're a columnist for computer world
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.400]   You're writing a column every week for two columns a year computer world should hire you as an employee
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.240]   But they avoid that by saying well he's an independent contractor, so California is saying no no
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.880]   You and uber drivers and all these other people need to be employees right wrong
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.200]   The the problem is that this is part of the fantasy land
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.320]   Interpretation where if you have a bunch of freelancers and you illegalize freelancing then they'll just hire them all no
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.960]   They just those people just go out of work. Well, I'll be honest Lisa saying we're moving to Vegas
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.600]   Well, that's what I would do that's the other thing that happens the business
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.840]   The businesses that's right. That's right. And so you know I actually have two
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.600]   Publishers that I submit more than 35 columns a year to why 35
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   We're that I don't know they just know
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.000]   Lorena es Gonzalez who's an assembly woman in San Diego has actually been a very active
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.760]   She helped create this bill and she said that apparently that they had like talked to some freelance writers journalists whatever
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:17.060]   Yeah, but the problem was I mean she clearly didn't look into you know bloggers and just kind of like the
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:23.040]   Fast amounts of us money this way. This is the scientific method. She used yes well
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.360]   Well, you're right one a week that'd be 52 split in half 26
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.080]   They went based on columnists so they split it in half for 26 and then they then they
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.040]   Well, that's kind of low. All right. We'll make it 30. Yeah
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.520]   arbitrary she admitted
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.680]   Yeah, but this is the other this is the second attack on my line of work that has occurred in the last couple of weeks
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.320]   So Zuckerberg decided that you know Facebook
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.800]   I should say I shouldn't personalize it Facebook decided they weren't gonna fact check political speech
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.320]   Which got all the press and also opinion columns. I'm like wait you not gonna fact test check opinion columns
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.320]   We didn't even miss lap opinion on any piece of fake news junk and that's fine
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.280]   And what does that say about opinion writers and then this this thing is it's
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.400]   We'll get back to a B5, but this is more tech
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.080]   Yeah, it is what it says it's not about opinion raised it says that Facebook doesn't want to weigh in on what the truth of
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.040]   fallacy of a statement because they're morons
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.760]   Opinium columns are based on facts that are checkable. This is like who doesn't know that it's like
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.960]   They're not know but if I say in my opinion column Facebook is evil. Yeah, you might say that's a fact
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.120]   But well it you might not
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:45.360]   Okay, so but nobody says that there's no such thing as a column that says that and doesn't go like to say
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.640]   Why that's what opinion columns do but you're
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.520]   And I think the same thing with political ads in fact the FTC and this is what
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.440]   Zuckerberg brought up. Yeah
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.160]   Does not does not
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.200]   Require that broadcast you can lie in a broadcast that the FTC requires truth and advertising with the exception of political ads
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:11.720]   And so Facebook's just doing what the FCC and FTC do but my point is that in like you have a reported article
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.320]   That's not an opinion column and then you have an opinion column
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.980]   They should have be based on the same standard. So for example if if either one of them says Facebook is evil
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.080]   That's not really that's just a
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.720]   That's just a claim that's not even libelous. I could say you're evil
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.840]   sacrificing puppies by the thousands that's if that's a
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.320]   Provable fact provable fat. Well, it's actually it's not a fact. So it's like you can't be proved or provable lie
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   But my point is that
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.980]   The biggest problem is that they're not fact checking anyone if they say that opinion
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:54.200]   Columns aren't can be fact checked because every every Macedonian teenager is gonna say oh, it's just like everybody is
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.880]   Oh, it's parody, but the good news is they won't be able to get a job in California
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:05.040]   That's the good news. Right exactly. So all we'll all be out of work and so yeah, no, but it's it's just it's just ignorant and
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:14.320]   It's it's extremely sort of a clussy way to just I spent decades literally Leo decades getting the point where I can be a freelance
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.360]   Writer with a couple of weeks you want to travel internationally even if I spend time overseas
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.320]   You don't want a job, but even if I didn't
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:30.200]   We've been if I wasn't nomadic, you know, it's like I've spent I've I've made a lot of sacrifices to get the point where I can be a
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:36.360]   Freelance have my own company right this is gonna impact what you do at your blog because that means you
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.040]   Can't freelancers you're gonna have to limit how many contributions they make a year not yet
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   But that has more to do with the amount of funding that I have
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   Right with the funding I don't have but if you were the
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:55.680]   This would be a well, I mean what's really interesting to me about this is that there there's a legitimate reason for state
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.400]   legislatures
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.800]   To look at things like the car sharing economy and the gig economy and stuff like that and say hey look
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   You are doing an end run around our laws
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.640]   These people need to be fully employed stop doing this in the way that you're doing it
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.240]   There's also a very legitimate reason to allow journalists to be freelancers and
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.400]   You know
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:25.160]   And to allow them freedom of work and freedom to be able to move from publication to publication as they see fit
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.800]   How it is I mean I'm still boggled by this law
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.720]   I write about it when it when it came out in the you know in the SPJ a society professional journalist was
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.240]   You know has been
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.880]   working on this
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.600]   And I'm still boggled by the by how this thing got passed and the way that it got passed
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:52.120]   And why have all the laws that Newsom decided to not sign he looked at this and said oh sure yolo this is fine
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:59.720]   It makes no sense to me and and it's so confusing as to why it was able to get through in the way
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.040]   That it is there's very good reasons for why journalism is set up the way it is now
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.560]   and has a lot to do with the lack of stability and lack of unions in
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.440]   journalism jobs and
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.160]   and and there's you know a very and there's very bad reasons for why the gig economy is the way it is and
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.040]   Trying to fix them both with you know the world's largest all-peen hammer seems like a really bad idea
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.140]   You're a freelancer flow. I am a freelancer
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:32.040]   I am your freelancer a twit by the way. I am and you're on more than 35 shows a year till January 1st
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:40.320]   She's a freelance. That's I don't know if it is. I don't know if it applies to podcasts. Yeah, I don't even know if it applies to broadcasting
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.020]   Apparently it doesn't least according to the didn't even think about that me
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.120]   I'm my my imagination. I'm gonna keep coming in until you guys lock the door on me
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:54.240]   But you know I'm in my part right now, you know my husband said to me this morning because we were talking about it
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.160]   He's like, you know what you got to go do the you got to go do your democratic thing and go get signatures to get this amended
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.720]   So being that I'm here in California. I'm stuck here. I'm I have
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.400]   Building a family here and I've been here all my life
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.680]   like I'm gonna have to go do some grassroots campaigning to get this amended because yelling at Lorena on
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.500]   Twitter is not gonna get it changed at this point
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.560]   So I am yelled at a lot a lot which I completely understand and absolutely of course
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.880]   That's what's gonna happen, but I I have to do something and being that I live in the state and I
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.360]   Have the privilege of having a husband that has been you know gets benefits for us. I
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:38.360]   Should go find some time to to do some grassroots campaigning and well
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.200]   Diplomatic way
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.440]   We shouldn't be too naive about the political process. Yeah
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.920]   Yeah, it goes in effect January 1st, but then the state has to try to enforce it then it goes to the courts
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.840]   There's many there's a long road before this actually gets enforced in it
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.120]   Yeah, I don't and I haven't studied it very closely
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.420]   I heard about it on twi it and haven't had real time to study it
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:08.600]   But is it when the company is in California? Is it when the employees in California?
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.200]   I don't know what in California in California. Well, I just moved to Paris. I'll tell you who it affected is Aunt Pruitt
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.680]   Who is a freelancer for tech republic?
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.040]   But as soon as he moved here tech republics that's sorry
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.880]   We can't employ you any longer because you now live in California. Yeah, and so there's definitely an impact
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:33.080]   And it's an impact on a lot of the people that I know and we use and the tech industry is full of freelancers
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.000]   It feels to me
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.700]   like a creepy
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.200]   End-run around the First Amendment because essentially what they're doing is they're saying yes
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.920]   Oh, wow, there's this rise of independent journalism
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.880]   How can we stop that how to suppress it and should journalists be exempt and maybe this is just for uber and Lyft drivers?
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.760]   I
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.440]   Wonder how uber and Lyft drivers the idea was to actually the idea was supposed to be to protect us
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.700]   Right from what I understand to make sure that if we are working this much for a certain
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.680]   Publisher we should be considered an employee. So, you know
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.480]   Do it once make me an employee?
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.240]   The problem is that who am I going to be an employee for I write I write one
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.120]   So I write for a public a new publication call it insider pro, right?
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.560]   They so that I'm you know and I write for security intelligence
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.480]   I write for fast company and I write for some other publications
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.880]   Are they all supposed to hire me as one of them supposed to hire me and I never write for the other ones that they're basically deciding
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:36.800]   Where my voice is heard as a journalist, right? It's outrageous. It's outrageous and it comes in and it's important to note for people
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.160]   Who aren't aware that this comes at a time when journalism continues a very very?
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:48.720]   Bad downward slide in the number of people employed on a regular basis as journalists there are
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.520]   7200 fewer journalists in the US this year than there were last year
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:00.640]   employee journalists, you know people are being forced into marketing positions into PR positions with
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.080]   You know at a shocking rate and and it's a real
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:12.400]   Problem for the business of journalism and for the important role that journalism does play in in you know our modern
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:19.840]   Dialogs the somebody in the chat room, and I missed the name. I went by quickly
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.800]   Made a good point. I actually work for my own company
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.640]   and
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.600]   Yeah, I'm a yes. Yeah. Yeah based in California
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:39.480]   Adiatically enough and and so I actually have a contractual relationship from company to company technically with so it's not about me personally
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.760]   But it's if that loophole though is widely used why would never uber and Lyft driver do it
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.560]   Then the legislature will throw that one out. You know it's funny in Mexico
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.400]   It looks like you're hiding in Mexico City there's that uber is fantastic
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.240]   But the driver is never the person who owns the car right so the person who owns the car hires a driver
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.000]   Yeah, yeah, oh you mean uber and Lyft or taxis
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.880]   Kind of did I say that well kind of are they trying not to be taxis?
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.400]   Well, they want they don't want to be considered taxis, but they're you're just carpooling right just carpool. That's really
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   That's what they say that's it's ride sharing
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.480]   And here's the build is ride sharing and here's the question
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.400]   I think the I understand the theoretical thing somebody wants to give a ride somebody wants a ride
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.920]   So they put them together and that's all it is and that's not clearly not what it actually is
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.960]   But is being a taxi driver this amazing job that where they have great health care and something like a
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:38.480]   Does anybody know if they're like no no well, I think seems like they're scraping by yeah
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.080]   I'm very see I have two hats to work because I'm an employer and an employee
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.200]   and I
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.960]   On the one hand I want to be very less safe there and just say well if you know if there are bad jobs in the world
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.120]   You don't have to take them and there are people who want those bad jobs
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.520]   You should allow them to take those jobs, right?
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.000]   People love being freelancers. Yeah, they're not they're not
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.880]   It's like ridiculous. Well, is there widespread exploitation? Is that the problem?
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.880]   Well, they're I mean there are in some there are there are
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:18.000]   The problem is in journalism. It's a lot harder because people don't know what the market rate is you know like
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.200]   Sorry $15 a career in journalism. If you're not in broadcast is a vow of poverty. It's like it's not a great job
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.760]   Whether I knew I was getting into it. It's like me. It's like I probably said this last time
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.800]   It's like the old joke the difference between a journalist and a large pizza is the large pizza can feed the family
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.820]   And it's it'll be funny and
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.160]   Yeah, right but shit is it the state's job to say oh
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.000]   Companies you got to pay these guys because I think you're right Mike doesn't mean that they will yeah
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.840]   It just makes it harder for everybody
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:54.640]   I mean I think in the tech industry especially this is important. We know that that tech companies have been using
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.400]   freelance and contract
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:05.120]   Employees as ways of getting around people who are otherwise doing 35 plus hours a week of work
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.200]   especially in
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.280]   Low wage or minimum wage jobs
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.800]   So the intent behind the build clearly seems to be on the up and up
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.400]   It worries me is this particular part of it and it doesn't just affect journalists
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:25.800]   It also affects people in in Hollywood working on TV shows working on movies because a lot of those are freelance
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.160]   and they have some of them have union protection because of
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.360]   The what's the union there?
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.400]   Can't remember the name of the union but
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.080]   The writers guild sorry, yeah, of course
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.040]   But for others, I mean, you know, this is this is simply gonna force journalists either out of California or
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.840]   Journalists outside of California are gonna benefit at our expense. Let's make it bigger than journalists
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:58.200]   Is it as the San Francisco Chronicle says is this killing the whole gig economy?
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.640]   Is this bad for everybody who's a gig worker and is it bad to be a gig worker? Are you being taken advantage of?
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.200]   It doesn't feel it that way right now
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   I mean, I could I think that could become the case I again I feel like whenever
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.980]   There's opposition to some new version of something
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.960]   There's all this outrage as if the old version was great. Let me give you a
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.460]   Not to change the subject but like prisons like everybody's against private prisons. They're awful right awful
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.080]   How are the public prisons doing like they're awful too and like
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.240]   Well, I mean, I'm actually glad you brought that up because one of the issues here is accountability
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.520]   You've been freelancing
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.640]   I mean, I haven't really done a lot of freelance work because when I left CNET
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.840]   I founded the parallax and this has been going on for you know for four years now, but
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.120]   You've been freelancing a really long time. What rates are you getting paid?
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:57.240]   You don't have to share but what like compared to how they were because I've heard from friends of mine who freelance at places where
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.040]   What they got paid for an 800 to a thousand word piece in
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.680]   2005 yeah is
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.360]   Unchanged from what they got paid for the exact same length piece in
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:17.640]   2015 you know, I mean so so clearly journalists are being taken advantage of and it's clear that it's that that it's not
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.560]   for
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.360]   Wages yeah, but it is good for freedom the difference is is that a lot of journalism
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:30.160]   Especially if you're in tech journalism you can do from a beach in Thailand. Why are we not all on a beach in Thailand?
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.880]   Because the Sun is
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:39.960]   Record I'm not go freelance so that I could travel the world I went freelance because I left a really
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:48.240]   Really difficult job and this was the only thing that I had the opportunity to still be able to contribute to my family
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.160]   I know very few people go freelance because they can't get a job
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.120]   Yeah, they do it because they want to be freelancers. So just just in my own in my own that's babe
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.620]   That's not what flu was saying. Yeah, I know but there's no way
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.600]   I did not have time to find a job
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.920]   I needed to immediately start making money and so the wheels just kept on turning and now I am where I am
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.440]   Right still freelancing. It's not to say I haven't been
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.280]   But what I'm saying is that you chose to go the freelance route rather than to look for another job route
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.120]   I did it out of desperation. Okay, but you did made that choice what this bill is doing is saying no
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.680]   You don't get that choice. You have to do the one you didn't choose
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.160]   Yeah, that's when you have to do yeah by law and in my own case I can make three or four times
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.040]   as much
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.200]   Working as the editor-in-chief of magazine in New York City that I make as a freelancer
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.080]   But I choose to be a freelancer for my own reasons
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.680]   Mm-hmm, and I don't think it's any of her business whether I make that choice or not
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.960]   I don't like her
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.040]   Forcing me into choices that I've rejected already
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.840]   It's outrageous. There are no protections either of the
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   employer decides not to
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.040]   employ you
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.240]   Exactly you're writing a exactly exactly that wasn't taking into consideration that well
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.040]   That's the next thing to go because California is in a at-will state
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.600]   But it could be far. I'm gonna reason but that could go away. They could become a
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.240]   No longer an at-will a right to work. So the problem with that is that I'm an adult and I'm not a child and I don't need
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.160]   a
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.800]   state legislator in in San Diego
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.560]   Telling me that oh, I'm not protected right so I know what the the risks are
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.000]   I know what the the deal is and I've made my choice and she's trying to override it
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.040]   We'd have we employ 20 or 30 freelancers including you flow effective including all of you not me not you
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   I don't give you any money. No
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.800]   No
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.680]   Because then I'd have to I mean I got free water if I paid you have to kill you
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:49.360]   Water but but I'm thinking of a lot of our shows. I mean Paul Therott and Mary Joe Foley are freelancers and he and not goes a freelancer
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.320]   I'm gonna a riches a freelancer almost all our shows. Yeah, we use freelance hosts. I
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.000]   Shouldn't be saying this out loud. We pay each and every one of them and give them fine benefits
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.120]   Yes, I don't think our business would it would be a very different business if we had all use staff hosts
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.040]   There'd be a lot fewer shows and less less hosting work. So you hire freelancers
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:15.760]   I have in the past. Yes, okay, but if if this goes into effect and let's say you did have people who are doing weekly columns
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:22.340]   For example, would you as a result of this hire them and give them full benefits and the whole bit one of the
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:30.640]   And I want to be really really clear about this one of the greatest pleasures about having started the parallaxes that I've been able to
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.400]   pay
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.280]   Very talented journalists people who are far better at this than I am very good wages a very good
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:44.960]   Compensation for their stories if I had ever been in a place where I could hire them outright
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.360]   I absolutely would have but I could tell you right now and I could tell you this is true
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.180]   But this law won't put you in that place. No, you can't because you add benefits
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:59.080]   Yeah, the cost is much higher. Oh sure and if I had to have 20 or 30 more employees
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.440]   This wouldn't sure it wouldn't exist. Yeah, all those freelancers you talk about have other jobs
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.120]   They're doing this is a side hustle right or something like that
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.120]   So it's like this is the beauty of freelancing is you can you can diversify your income streams
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.760]   right and it's like
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.760]   It's a great but there's not a lot of jobs out there for those of us who do want to have full-time jobs, too
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.360]   Right, that's why freelancing is so great. They're not gonna give
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.040]   Give you a job. They're just gonna take away your current job
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.120]   I understood what California government wanted to do for lifting uber drivers
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.400]   I and I had I was very much in agreeance with it as a California voter
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:46.320]   But then I saw what it was gonna do to my business and I was like, why couldn't you guys just use something separate like
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.880]   So I'm gonna have to go to the grocery store and get signatures. I mean
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:01.120]   This my friends this is the subject of our next segment. Oh my ear. Oh soap
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.080]   It looks like a bar of soap. That's actually an earo beacon
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.880]   Eero is our sponsor. It is the it was I think the first
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.760]   Like consumer mesh
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.880]   Wi-Fi out there. I remember when I first read about it. I thought that's crazy
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.160]   That's what are they and then I got it and I went this is that's crazy to use anything else in fact
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.840]   When the new arrows came out I bought those gave the old ones to my mom and Rhode Island
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.840]   I love it because I could go on to the arrow app. I could see how her networks doing
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.880]   I can see how ours is doing I can pause our
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.640]   16 year olds internet on on school nights, which I do 10 p.m. Internet is off
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.320]   Yeah, they really oh, I love the howls
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:49.760]   Internet withdrawal is a terrible thing to see I
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.480]   It's great because you know while Michael's watching YouTube and we're watching Netflix
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.600]   We can still get email because the ear is smart enough to route the data appropriately
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.840]   You don't have to worry your security camera is gonna go offline because you're watching Netflix in the bedroom
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.600]   Eero is easy to set up to you put the arrow up on your phone you plug in the Eero base station
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:19.040]   The phone will help you position the beacons and you're done and at any time I could see what's happening
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.440]   I could check usage I could pause the Wi-Fi I can get alerts. I love this part
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.800]   Every time somebody comes in to the house. I could see them join the network and I and I could say oh
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:35.240]   Look you can also share your Wi-Fi without giving away the password. There's a great guest mode
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.080]   I pay the additional ninety nine dollars for Eero plus because you get so much more
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.600]   Including by the way great ad blocking malware protection
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:51.240]   I'll ever have to worry about ransomware in our house because all of that malware is kept out of our email that is fantastic
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.200]   Why are you looking like that Seth
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.720]   You want to hack me go ahead. No, I don't want to hack me baby
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.360]   I think I want to see some spearfish and email
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:10.600]   Eero protects and secures all the traffic going through my network using strong encryption and security protocols
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.560]   I just think Eero solves look Wi-Fi
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:20.080]   Started great, and then you got 20 computers 15 IOT devices and the neighbors got that super duper Wi-Fi
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.560]   MIMO router with four by four antennas that's blasting you you need Eero
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:31.960]   So the Wi-Fi keeps working. I am very happy. Look at the Eero secure - and all the additional features you get
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:39.720]   Never think about Wi-Fi again get yours fixed as soon as tomorrow because we've got free overnight shipping when you go to Eero

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:06.400]   Thrilled that we use your although something weird has happened two nights in a row at 748 p.m. Comcast stopped working
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:16.280]   7 for you TV or the kid like no the I don't try the cable TV the internet and then and then I said oh
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.280]   The first time and I went online and said yeah, there's an outage 50 to 500 people are out
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:28.960]   I don't know what that means and it'll be back at 11 18 and then and then the same thing happened the next night arbitrary
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:35.880]   Wow you think it's a DDoS says you think somebody's like I think we're living in a simulation and it was I could tell you have
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:43.760]   Comcast yeah, it is not having internet is bad why we have twice now tried to watch El Camino
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:51.040]   Why he's halfway through the internet's gone out. Why don't we have gigabit fiber everywhere because we're not in Sweden
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.880]   I know no, I know why yeah because because
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.320]   The incumbents this is always the case is true of fossil fuel
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.960]   It's true of cable internet the incumbents have make so much money on existing infrastructure
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:10.360]   They can afford to pay the members of Congress and lobby them in the FCC to protect their
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.160]   Monopoly and that's what we have in this country of a duopoly the FCC enforced it
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.920]   They said only the phone company and the cable company in that any given region can provide internet service
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.320]   and and they did that because the cable company said oh
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.600]   We just won't make enough money to put in the infrastructure
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.000]   You've got to protect us and then once they put it in they said and now you have to keep protecting us
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.400]   I mean it's terrible. It's criminal
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.640]   We invented the internet in the US and we have the worst internet in the
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.040]   Oh, we're invented no not as worse not not worse than Australia
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.000]   Yes, Australia has a similar problem though. Yeah, right?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.880]   They're also really spread out as we are that may be another problem is geographic size of the region and they have suicidal bushes
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:57.480]   Yeah, well every dangerous spiders that everything will kill you there drop bears including the internet now
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   We have a lot of Australian listeners and I just want to say I'm sorry. I apologize for these guys
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.080]   No
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.160]   Andy and I have had a long-running joke about the Kimby Kimby Bush on the material podcast for the last six weeks
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.960]   No, if you touch it it makes you want to like basically kill yourself
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:21.260]   It's like the most painful thing if you touch it and but it looks so pretty and it looks fuzzy and beautiful and inviting and then you
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.800]   And it go it is
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.920]   Bush's before you start using it
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.200]   So magically my bill has is now gone up to the point where it's just pushing $300. Oh my god
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.680]   I know it was 200 you do knock the kids off the internet
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:44.160]   So so in SF I have the option of switching to Sonic gigabit
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:50.440]   John just got which of it fiber here downtown nice. Are you getting it John?
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.880]   He's out to go get the fiber you just ran out the door
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:02.440]   Door knob anyway, you like it well no I haven't switched to yet because I'm worried that with in a house with five people
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.920]   Sorry six people I have roommates
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   And everyone has their own bedroom. So there's that I'm just gonna hang this on my mic and there it is on
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   Yeah, it comes and says oh
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:17.880]   Spons actually we have 10 gigabit symmetric Sonic here. Oh nice pretty nice
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:23.600]   I download a lot of things and I come to come visit it down. Oh you want all your time getting my apps
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.920]   It's the bits are free the son lived in Roseville for a while. He had
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.760]   Consolidated communications blistering fast fiber in his apartment and I just go over there
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.000]   I mean seven I was to hook in an ethernet would be like 700
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.640]   Down it was so good. We have so many problems when he moves we do
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:49.440]   We have so many problems globally and even in this country and even locally like the wildfires that are gonna burn up
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.120]   The internet we need something to distract us from all of it. Okay. Well
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:59.960]   Completing is a happy place. So someone in the chat room just just brought this up in a slightly snarky way
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.800]   But they're absolutely right. Um should internet be a public utility. Yes
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.960]   So in my mind because we've done a great job of maintaining other public utilities. I mean I agree
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.360]   I do think it should be solved. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm all ears
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.560]   By the way, yes more dick more more blackouts coming in fact
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:24.520]   I don't want PG and E having my internet calm cast well, they're not public calm cat
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.560]   PG and E we say that they're evil does that yeah, they're oh they're evil. That's just an opinion
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.560]   There's a whole fact we may actually shut down again next week
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:39.200]   I should just warn people yeah black out, but they're apparently heavy winds high hot winds are coming high hot winds a high hot ones coming your way
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   so
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   What was I about to say I forgot now
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.360]   When did you hear what we should do to fix the internet should it be publicized? There's a very simple there's a very simple solution
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.560]   Metropolitan areas should
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:34:00.900]   Could whether through eminent domain or through investment build the infrastructure and then lease the infrastructure to multiple
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.000]   Commercial entities to provide the internet over that infrastructure
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.200]   So just like the road system they should be owned by the municipalities
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.660]   But everybody should be allowed to use those thoroughfares giving us competition
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:19.780]   I that's my opinion that that's the well the part of the problem is that our government
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:26.900]   That which is controlling all this stuff is owned by corporations because we have money and politics and if we could get the money out of politics
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.420]   I think the competition would happen it all comes down to that. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. That'll happen soon
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:39.300]   The problem is optimistic people who get the money are the ones who in charge of saying no we don't want any
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:45.620]   That's not gonna happen. All right. Where do you want to talk about Apple? Oh, no, let's talk about Google because you've got a pixel
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.380]   Four I'm so jealous. She's so fed up with Google flow was at the event
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:56.060]   This week the made by Google 2019 event. Did you you were in the room? That's called not orange
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:04.900]   The white one it's pretty look so I mean is the regular pixel for not the pixel for XL
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.900]   On not
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.700]   They just given up on not copying Apple if they just given up on that
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:22.380]   This is a four top burner yours is a three top burner so you can only have three pots burning on yours
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.380]   But you only have two lenses
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.540]   It's an electric two of the burners. It's an electric
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:35.740]   Leo their holes that's all that matters so as holes in this logic the general consensus on the made by Google
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.660]   Event for those who weren't there you were there for those who weren't there was it was incredibly dull
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:46.020]   I saw Martha Stewart and Annie Liba with so I don't know I was fine, but even Annie Liba
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.580]   It's felt like she was kind of well
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:52.820]   She didn't have much I wanted I saw that she wanted to talk about the subjects that she shot
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:58.460]   Yeah, the pixels that they had given her but obviously they wanted to talk about the camera hardware and how it works
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.740]   But you know highlight for me was Martin Lavoy. Yes
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.100]   Oh andy next to me. He was just like oh my gosh. It's a man boy
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.300]   I've just heard the shutter shutter just going off to me
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:15.320]   So mark Lavoy's former Stanford professors and emeritus now who really kind of is a pioneer of computation
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.660]   You went to Google has done a lot to make Google the king of computational photography
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:26.700]   although you might argue that other companies like Apple and maybe Huawei are
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.060]   Are also doing some pretty interesting stuff. Sorry. Huawei is not allowed in this country
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.020]   Well, if you had a while way for you, yes, no, I know
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:41.240]   I I guess but I did what Mark Lavoy told me to do by zooming in and using the telephoto lens on the
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.940]   He said do not crop the images. I didn't crop zoom in. I zoomed in and
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.660]   I was not that impressed
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:53.620]   I posted them in the Twitter community if you'd like to go over there and see them
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.460]   I have a picture of Amtrak looking very jaggedy
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.740]   You probably take drink a lot of coffee so your hands are probably like this right?
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:04.260]   Here's the thing. I mean she wants to use our hands. They don't want us to use the tripod
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.140]   They want us to be able to just go out and shoot. Yeah
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:13.060]   Not any Leibowitz was using this big rig this big stabilizing rig
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:17.300]   Yes, we saw on the photo she's using the stabilizing rig the same one you can buy on Ellie
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:27.020]   Yeah, so it should be some we should be in the all about Android category somewhere. Yeah, I was just gonna find your pictures pictures
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.340]   Yeah, pictures pixels pictures
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:35.460]   Yeah, I try to capture a bird with it, but I got the it flew away that you weren't that impressive I
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.900]   Wasn't that impressive that you weren't that impressed to
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.180]   Here's the zoom. Yeah, your photography wasn't that important
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:49.700]   So that's so this this picture is of Crockett and Crockett is directly across from where I live
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:56.340]   Oh, what's the point where there I can see the warehouse the warehouse the one of the polar bear in the seal? Yeah
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.700]   The warehouse yeah
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.260]   Friend used to bounce there. Yeah, we we still like to go there. It's a nice timeout
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.780]   So Amtrak goes through there and I happen to catch it and I like to go out here
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.220]   Sometimes at sunset because you could see the seals in the water and it's just really beautiful
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.220]   The birds are command. It's very serene
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:16.980]   And so I there's Amtrak so I got out of the car at the marina
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:21.300]   And I tried to take a picture of it and it was moving slow enough
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:26.220]   But like it's still when you zoom in it just looks like soft. It's soft exactly
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.020]   Some of that may be atmospheric. Do you think it looks a little hazy?
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:35.920]   But you can see in the water the water is not great. Well if you go to bird picture
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.800]   That was here's a boy picture. That was really that was a hard one. That was just up in a tree
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.700]   The wind was blowing so hard that day, so these leaves were moving
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.940]   Remember it can't stack very well if there's a lot of motion, so
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.420]   That's the problem that might be the problem so the last little picture I posted in there. Oh boy. We're here
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.780]   That this looks good. It does but how much zoom is that that?
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:06.040]   My thing this was about four or five and it goes up to eight as far as I can remember
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:13.340]   And still looks a little pixelated. Yeah, that's the thing it looks pixelated to me. I was expecting a little more
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.980]   crisp
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:21.100]   So I'm gonna play with it and one of the things both Apple and Google have done
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.580]   With this generation of phone is say oh and we're gonna add some it's gonna get better
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.260]   So Apple's pushing out deep fusion in the next few weeks
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:34.620]   I would guess with the iOS 13.2 and Mark Lavoy said when he was talking about you
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:41.180]   So in a picture of the moon he says very bright, but the background is very dark. You can't do both yet stay tuned
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:48.100]   Applying that also Google was gonna be shipping an update to the camera. Yeah, yeah, they're always making it better
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.180]   Yeah, every I mean we always say on all my Android everything Google does is beta
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:59.300]   Because you just kind of know that getting into it. Okay. Well, it's like the beginning. I'm sorry. Is Gmail still beta
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.540]   No, they know they after five years or something. They are more than that
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:08.580]   Right
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:15.660]   So you kind of before the show we're saying yeah, you know pixel three might be a better choice for a lot of people
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:22.500]   Not why spend a thousand bucks if you've got a pixel three. I just I'm really miss the fingerprint scanner on the back
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.500]   Oh show me face how fast is face? Oh
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   Why are you wiping it on yourself? I don't I know because it's instinctual. Okay. Oh that was quick look it unlocked
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.060]   I wasn't even look at it before she even looked at it. Let me let me cover your eyes and see if it
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.060]   Oh, yeah, don't try are you dead?
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.220]   It unlocked
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.300]   She I for those of you listening I put my hand across her face
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:49.220]   I mean wasn't just your eyes her whole upper head is gone. It's still unlocked. Is there no fingerprint?
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:55.420]   Biomatrix all non nine good grief zero silk nothing on the front either
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.740]   So this was a story and actually Seth I'd be curious what you thought about this was a story
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.420]   Google
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:06.980]   Apparently in the pre-release versions had a switch as apple does on the iPhone that says require attention
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.740]   You know, you I want to see your eyes, but in the release version your eyes could be closed
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:17.340]   Somebody BBC tested it with people pretending to be asleep. It's still unlocked worse
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.620]   You could be dead
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.620]   Yeah, or or decomposed
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.180]   Or have somebody
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.220]   Recognize your facial bone structure then apparently
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:33.180]   Surgeons will benefit is that a security issue your finger print fingerprint sensor still works when you're dead, too
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:39.980]   Also, the yeah until that decompose the solely chip radar should be able to go penetrate earth and the top of a casket
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:46.420]   So so fingerprint does not work if you're dead and cold
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:51.060]   So the fingerprint at least is after you just called on the inside apple you simply met it
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:55.360]   You can warm some of this finger if you cut off their thumb and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.360]   You can microwave it. Okay
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.380]   What if you're emotionally dead
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:07.380]   Is your dead inside work? It'll still work so but you know so you sound like you're saying that's a tempest in a teapot
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:14.240]   I mean, it's not it's not a non-issue. It's certainly something that I think we should have the ability to control
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:20.940]   I mean I said that switches said your eyes have to be open or you have to be making a particular face
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.260]   I don't know
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:29.580]   But I would love it if if one of these companies mandated that to use their facial recognition to unlock your device
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:35.380]   You had to make some kind of goofy face at the phone that would be brilliant because who would know a good you could do that now
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:41.740]   Right if I did the face recognition, we should try this. Okay when I get my pixel 4. I'm gonna try like okay
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.500]   This will be my face
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.340]   Yeah, that's a good one and then you practice it works
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:51.180]   It still works she's taking her turn. No, it doesn't with your time out
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:56.820]   So that I think that's a good point Seth only you would know except that people would gradually learn
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:03.500]   Every time you looked your phone you wait. Yeah, there was something going on. Yeah, like the finger the pattern on luck
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:12.140]   I actually have a lot of problems with facial recognition on phones as a way to as the only way to unlock the device that's
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:20.380]   Have multi-factor or additional people who I mean as a motorcyclist people who who are on their phones on cars in cars all the time
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.380]   Make me want to
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.420]   Strangle them. Oh, so you're saying if you're gonna
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.940]   With solely you probably don't even have to lift it you just look down at it
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.700]   Oh, you're gonna love the new version of Android Auto phone in the car
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:37.140]   This is the first phone to ship with an actual radar chip in it. That's the solely
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.580]   I haven't it has to be approved by the FCC and the equivalent worldwide in fact
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.860]   I understand you can't buy solids not turned on in some countries India
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.940]   It's not they're not gonna sell the phone in India
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:53.520]   It Google says that it all it they they whitelisted right so it's like us UK Canada
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.740]   Australia and I think and most European countries, okay
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:04.420]   So lies in Europe huge number. Yeah huge now exactly and you five eyes will unlock the phone really well
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:09.860]   I really fast yeah, but it's it's really not a global phone for because of the solely chip
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:15.620]   And if if I as a solely chip user in the US go to a non solely country. It just stops working
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.820]   It that's what's it's a it's geofenced. How do how do I get into the phone?
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.460]   Geofenced without a fingerprint. Well, you have a backup with a pin, right?
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.860]   So he just says I can't do it and and that's the only way I can
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.340]   Get back into the phone after it's off and
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:35.940]   Which is interesting because Google you know one of the one of the selling points they use with Google Fi is you can
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:41.660]   Take these phones to any country and they'll work as normal and you'll just pay your yeah
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.260]   But you'll pay the exact same price as you would you don't have to get a special international
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.780]   So that's interesting because
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.100]   It
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:59.740]   It feels like I hate to say this Google's copying Apple Apple gets rid of the fingerprint reader Google gets rid of the finger
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:04.260]   People Apple gets rid of the headphone Jack Google gets rid of the headphone Jack does it seem?
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:11.300]   I mean maybe it's like a response to consumer. It's driven by need and demand is what we want not that apples
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:18.180]   I mean we not we but these debates were happening a decade ago with browsers, right? The big thing was is you know
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:25.860]   Is Internet Explorer going to copy the latest feature in Firefox the answer is you bet now runs Chrome and now
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:32.020]   Well, except except now Chrome and Firefox are doing their thing and it's all to me as far as I'm concerned
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:38.540]   I think like the more important issues are how do these devices handle the the things that?
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:44.820]   Consumers need to be concerned about and businesses need to be concerned about when it comes to privacy security
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.780]   Well your security guys is is face a bad idea?
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:54.740]   I think face is not a bad idea on the face of it, but I think
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:59.980]   Seriously, I think it's something that should be an option
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:07.720]   I think making it the only biometric especially after Apple and Google had such great success with fingerprint readers that
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:15.060]   Forcing people onto facial recognition biometrics that is a bad idea. I think it's too soon
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.220]   I think the technology has not yet been
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:25.860]   Figured out. I mean we've had biometric fingerprint readers on laptops for a decade and a half for two decades prior to phones
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:31.980]   So we should point out though that there's fingerprints in this fingerprints that there's face ID and there's face ID that
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:39.820]   Some are more effective than others Apple in fact said that our fingerprint reader has one in ten thousand false positives
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.820]   Our face reader has one in one million false positives
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.700]   So they they pitched it that was a more secure
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:51.540]   The fingerprint reader on most laptops until recently was not particularly
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:47:00.060]   Right it was it was it was Apple's purchase of whatever the company was the Israeli authentic or something that was it that
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:05.760]   Allow them to really push the development of it and you know and and that spurred the market
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.740]   I'm just concerned that with how how little we know about how
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.980]   About how facial recognition data gets used
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:21.860]   And and and oh but it's not it's not it's not it's stored in all cases. It's stored on phone
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   It's not sent to the cloud
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.900]   It Apple doesn't send to the cloud Google doesn't send it the cloud. It is on phone right. They're not sending your face
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.540]   metrics somewhere else there's any well well I
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:38.700]   Mean they are sending a hash and they do and they do know it's in a reversible hash though somebody given that hash is not gonna
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:45.220]   Get some information about you. They do know when it fails. They do know how I mean they're obviously getting something again
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:52.140]   They're able to improve it. Yeah, I mean in truth the the biggest risk is a matte the mass acceptance of face
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:48:01.620]   Authentication where people like y'all I'm already doing with my phone but it's a net benefit because until recently people didn't lock their phones at all
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.600]   Right when you had to enter as a four digit code even
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:12.060]   Most people more than half didn't it was the fingerprint reader that forced people to secure their phones better
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.140]   And Apple was able to say there was no you're gonna use this
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:20.940]   Technology and you're gonna enter a pin and it's gonna lock no matter what you cannot right any no modern phone
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:25.640]   Can you use without it being locked right right but the reality net gain in the long run
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:31.580]   I mean you can't set them to you can still turn off locking and all that no you can't no you can't you can't no
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.220]   Not on iPhones not on pixels not on
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:40.500]   Samsung's walk around and I could unlock phone
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:46.900]   I'm total I was totally guilty of that until until I had a fingerprint reader on my computer on my
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.860]   phone his phone
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.140]   He's dead he's still better off than a phone that didn't have any protection
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.620]   But the difference is that now that we have biometrics on the phone all kinds of
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:03.020]   Applications have emerged that rely on well, okay think about think about like last pass my bank my bit my
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:08.820]   So so so what though one of them one of the major issues is that at least in the US
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.900]   we haven't yet sorted out legal ramifications of biometric login and
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.540]   It's still not considered
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:22.940]   A key that you know right even though it's your face and it's unique to you
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:28.820]   And so you and so law enforcement agencies don't necessarily need
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:33.100]   You know a court order in order to force you to unlock your device
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.500]   That's
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:43.820]   You know that for one thing that's problematic the other thing is is that there is potential for abuse when you have when you
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:49.900]   When we've seen that demonstrated that you can show a photo of a person to a phone with facial recognition
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.580]   And have that device unlocked you can't really do that with fingerprints easily
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.180]   Yes, but we're now that we're in the world of GANS
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:05.100]   Which is the technology behind deep fakes you can actually generate and you can do you can do brute force attacks on password solely is smarter than that
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:10.780]   Apple's face ID is smarter than that. You can't show it a picture it at that's why you have radar
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:17.220]   That's why you have these depth sensing cameras. Mm-hmm. You have to make a 3d model and even then there's also
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:23.900]   Infrared sensing so you so you need to have it heated it becomes more and more difficult
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:29.540]   I you know you're probably right you can make a simulacrum that would unlock a phone, but it is non trivial
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:35.360]   Mm-hmm. I think that we're beyond that time now on the other hand the Samsung S10 and no
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:43.660]   Which have I've never liked it a kind of a crappy ultrasonic fingerprint reader. It's really slow. It often fails
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:52.260]   It turns out if you have a screen protector on your Samsung phone. It's not reading your fingerprint
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:57.060]   It's reading the pattern on the back of the screen protector and so anybody can unlock your phone
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:04.100]   Samsung says we're gonna try to fix this this week that is an example of just bad design
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.500]   Especially since those Samsung phones come with a screen protector
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:11.060]   I don't know if the Samsung screen projector does that or only third part. They do are we yeah?
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:16.420]   Yeah, okay, I thought it was just one plus no no Samsung weirdly comes with a screen
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:22.940]   I thought why it why are they doing this? I guess because so many people like it. Yeah, it's convenient. I always peel it off
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.460]   really? Yeah, that's brave
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:31.260]   Look at this face down on the table the man owns 30 phones. It doesn't matter. I don't care
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.980]   If a phone dies, I give it to my kids
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:46.180]   All right, you know, I don't know what to say I think it's I think on balance. It's good any any security is better than no security
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.380]   Yes
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:54.940]   Your right mic that a lot of software like our banking software suddenly I can unlock my all my financial stuff with just
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:59.500]   Face if that face is wrong or bad or not good. That's a potentially a problem
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:03.700]   I just try to set it up with my bank on pixel for I did not ask me for it
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:08.060]   Oh, really? Yeah, you have to turn it on you have to go in and they by the way
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:14.900]   They make you sign a very at least my bank all my banks make you sound very long multi multi page disclaimer
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.340]   Which I think
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.660]   Boils down to you if this doesn't work. It's not our fault
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:27.020]   You're taking all responsibility. I just like the idea that this is this because so much valuable stuff is in this phone is
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.860]   secured and
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.780]   And my banking information is further secured. I just feel like the
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.100]   Even if it's not perfect that if somebody's targeting me
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.860]   They're gonna get in if they can build a 3d model of my face with an internal heater
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:46.260]   They can get in but that I want some speed bumps. That's all we're talking right set them ultimately security is just speed bumps
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.300]   You can also use face ID for two factor authentication
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.860]   Just need another factor the other thing is I think the truth is that where to the point now where it's too late
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:53:02.380]   It's not even worth having the conversation face ID is and face authentication and face everything is here to stay forever
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:09.060]   It's like we were not talking back. I know that you know some some governments want to ban it. We're talking temporary
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.700]   They'll bring it back later when it's you see marketing to well, there's well
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:17.300]   There's different there's certainly a difference between facial recognition to unlock your device and facial recognition
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:25.040]   You use my police on the streets used by law enforcement or used by private companies for retail and marketing purposes
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.380]   and
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:30.380]   There's and I think one of the real challenges state of California has banned
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.260]   law enforcement from using
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:39.060]   Until 2022 and the theory is the real problem is false positives people of color
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.660]   Women are not
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:47.060]   Accurately, you know represented so until we can fix it. Let's not use it right. I think that's sensible
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.380]   But they will fix it. Don't you think those that if you're Taylor Swift?
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:54.380]   We know state tell us if to use this in her stadiums. There's people stalking her
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:54:00.220]   There's face recognition used at the gates to make sure those people don't enter the stadium
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:05.940]   I that does not seem bad to me. No, I think I think there are legitimate uses of facial recognition
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:11.380]   I think that there has to be a much more robust public debate about what those are
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:18.940]   I think that relying on lawmakers who have struggled for you know decades to figure out how to construct a decent password
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:22.060]   To be leading this debate is a problem
[00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:27.100]   But I also feel that it's a problem for the tech companies to be leading the debate because they have a financial
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:32.660]   Investment in this that goes far beyond anything else. I think there's more
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:41.620]   I think this is actually emblematic of a massive problem with tech which is that the more advanced tech gets the harder it becomes to
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.980]   accurately talk about what the problems with it are and
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:51.220]   Figure out who the stakeholders are and figure out what the responsibility should be there's there's no discussion
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:58.500]   except in a few verified circles of the ethics of of what's going on that worries me deeply and
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.780]   you know and
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:08.660]   And I think overall that we are not really we as a as a country and we as a society are not really talking about
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:13.420]   What we want this for what we don't want this for do we want it to stop Taylor Swift being stocked?
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.980]   Sure. Nobody wants her to be stocked except for her stalkers
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.980]   But what else do we want to be walking past?
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:29.060]   You know t-shirts in in a shopping almost your undertone right and then and then have you know
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:33.580]   Your phone vibrate with ads for a discount for t-shirts. That sounds horrible. What's the price?
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:39.380]   Who can my point? My point is the public will care because people give away their privacy for three dollars
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:46.060]   And but but that's why it's up to us geniuses here on Mount Olympus to make these decisions. So you opt in right?
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.060]   Well, the biggest
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.060]   confusion around face
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.620]   Recognition technology is that it's all lumped together
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:58.140]   So for example the way you you need to use Jin Yang's like not hot dog method for
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:03.980]   Waiting out stalkers. You don't recognize everyone who comes in. It's like oh, there's there's so-and-so there's so-and-so
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.780]   No, Mike has just made an obscure reference to
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.900]   300 arena by the way
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.900]   Fantastic
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:17.020]   Not stalker not stalker not stalker me me me stalker right that we can all get behind that
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:20.380]   approach to face ID there's nothing wrong with that
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:27.380]   As long as you're not trying to identify everybody and what's wrong with it though is a place to use it and every other black man is
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:33.780]   identified as a perp even though he's not just because he's an African-American that's problematic sure it's absolutely
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.540]   problematic and it's great that they band it for that reason also emblematic of the larger system
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:41.580]   Well, yes, sorry in other words is exactly like it was before when they were using their own
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:45.100]   Consider tech companies developing
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:53.140]   technology especially something like facial recognition not using it in say the US or other countries that have
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:57:00.580]   More advanced debates about what the technology is for and then selling that technology for uses that we would be abhorred by
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:07.900]   And again these these conversations are not happening by and large the technology is being forced on people
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:14.380]   and and I think again that that without the conversations about ethical impact and
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.740]   How it is that we want to proceed?
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:24.100]   We're gonna wind up in a situation very similar to where we are with privacy and other things where where there's issues of community standards
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.100]   There's issues of what privacy means
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:33.780]   Now in Android 10 you can you now have a nuanced option for choosing which apps you've installed can
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:40.100]   Can use your GPS and and locate you and tell I love that by the way, which is great doing that
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:44.620]   Why didn't they do it back in Android for well, you know what I mean?
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.700]   Like we didn't we didn't say anything we were so innocent
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:53.060]   We were before wasn't coming after us and going there's a Sephora down the block from you
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:59.780]   Did you know that there's well see we'll see we'll see this this is the point is that people may say oh sure for three dollars or whatever
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:04.100]   I'm happy to give away my privacy because you're giving me 15% off on a t-shirt
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:08.980]   But I actually suspect that once people's phones are vibrating or we're doing whatever
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.660]   Notifying them that there's these discounts who cares no one's gonna care
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:21.460]   It's gonna be an overwhelming deluge of nonsense and there's it's worse than that too because like we're you know people in Marin County are all concerned like
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:26.500]   Oh, we don't want face recognition used by the local city council exaggerating here
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.840]   But then like tick to who knows if tick-tock is not scanning everybody's face and just
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:37.980]   Beaming that that's your that biometric data back to Beijing to the problem is that most people aren't technically
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:46.020]   Sophisticated enough to know what the consequences might be that's right. It's too complicated and nor necessarily should they no
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.740]   You know I don't feel like you know well we do our best
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:55.500]   I think all of us do our best to let the public know what's going on. That's our job. That's our job
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.860]   They're not particularly they don't seem particularly interested well
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:02.620]   I try to have this conversation with my gal pals like we'll talk about you know
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:08.860]   I try to talk to them about well the on the subject of like the marketing that kind of hits you all the time
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:14.100]   They're like well, I don't mind that like Facebook is taking my data for instance and like you know
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.540]   Sending me this stuff because it just makes stuff that much easier
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:23.780]   And then I say well, but how would you but how do you feel knowing that that stuff is getting sold to companies to like push things
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:29.540]   Towards you to like get your money and then when you say it in that way like and that's not a difficult thing to say
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:35.220]   That's a very like obvious kind of little statement to put out there and that's when the person goes. Oh
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:38.260]   Yeah, that's a good point
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:48.860]   You know sometimes I get that but you know what I feel like sometimes
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:53.740]   We are telling horror stories to people who just say no, this is all great. What are you doing?
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.420]   Well, then I tell my friends I go listen guys
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:59.500]   It's okay listen because Sephora's always after me when I'm near Sephora. I know
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:06.780]   I don't let you forget. No, I was another makeup store the other day in LA
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.460]   Called Riley Rose and they were like, you know this Sephora one block away
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:21.340]   Hypothetical you actually get notifications. Yeah, and I and I have a Sephora app you did you must have a very big part of the Sephora community
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:28.420]   I am I mean and they actually just just to give them credence. Yeah, they're very technically like they're one of the highest kind of
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:32.460]   technically inclined companies especially in kind of the
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.340]   Marketed to women with realm
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.060]   Mm-hmm
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.540]   And so they did this as a way to kind of be like
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:44.540]   This is how to like get more people on the door and to like come to the classes and to come try on makeup and it works
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.260]   And you don't mind
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:52.460]   You've embraced it. I am just like all right Sephora shut up dismiss, but you didn't delete the app
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.940]   No, I'm still and I didn't tell it not to have location access to my Android 10
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.940]   I do like it both iOS
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:04.620]   13 and Android 10 are now telling you that apps are following you and giving you the option
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:10.980]   Oh, they bug you too like Android bugs you and they're like are you sure you want Instagram to open every time you hit an Instagram link?
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.060]   Are you sure about this? I'm like, yes, but I
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.140]   See they're gonna be the unwelcome guests soon, right?
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.220]   I
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:25.260]   After years and years and years of not having these features. I appreciate that. I do I want the I mean
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:30.340]   Yeah for things like links. Yeah, you know, you do have to choose and then once you if you choose
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:39.300]   To do it one things I like and at least for me on 10 is that it's been asking me about once a day with a different app each time
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:44.100]   Whether it's GPS or I'm finding out that apps like there's some some apps
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:51.220]   I have I have a little thermal printer that I use just like print out stupid things and apparently and it's a it's a Chinese app and
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:54.940]   Apparently it has access to my location. I don't know why
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:59.060]   Why do you have access to that? It's yeah, it's a locally stored printer
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:06.160]   Like probably worse than that. They may also have access to every single file you print that has all my print is like memes and stuff
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.300]   So it's fine. You print me. We don't need to follow her anymore. No, I'm a bullet journaler
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.980]   I like to like I like physical media. Okay, stan inside a journal
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:19.580]   I'm that's how I if you ever get an invitation to join fancy bear or the Russian troll factory
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:24.540]   Just you know that may be why I'm just saying she's good with memes. Yeah, someone's got a big
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.540]   Eastern European so I know
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:35.700]   Let's take a little break. We're gonna come back with more fabulous panel Florence ion is here. Oh that flow from all about Android
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:43.420]   Look, I you're living you're doing the Eastern European thing. You got the hoop earrings. This is me Leo
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:46.340]   I like you're being yourself
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:52.860]   We also have Mike Elgin. He is our gastro nomad gastro nomad that net if you want to
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:58.180]   Dine with him when's your next event Mexico City in November and December?
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:02.820]   We have two coming up and then we've got a good your New Year's Eve in Mexico. No, we're not gonna do that again
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:08.300]   It was fantastic last year, but it was just really Mexicans really are into going back home with their families
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:13.900]   So finding chefs and all that stuff really bro, but the two coming up are just gonna be amazing and people don't realize how
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:20.460]   Exquisitely high-end like the cuisine of Mexico City can be. Oh, we're gonna really explore that
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:28.300]   That's why Bravo's a reality TV show now based in Mexico City. Yeah, it's called Mexico dynasties Mexico City is the greatest food city
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:35.220]   It's just amazing so they're the phenomenal phenomenal food there. Yeah, not just street food, but yes high-end chefs
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:42.380]   Yes, unbelievable on blue and we explore all the Mexican things that have been adopted by the world like chocolate vanilla tomatoes
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:48.500]   Chili's all that stuff Mexican and they're like Mexico City is a huge expat city, too. There's a lot of folks who came over
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.980]   during World War two and
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:57.340]   There's a lot of different influences there. Yep. Yep. Our coffee guy is like this super genius in terms of coffee
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:04.020]   We do all this coffee experience stuff. He's actually of Lebanese descent and it's like a lot lots of expats
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.980]   It's such a cool city such a party. Yeah, digital a gastronomat
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.300]   Elgin.com and of course Seth Rosenblatt
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.300]   He's our security guru
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.840]   We're glad to have him editor-in-chief of the parallax at the dash parallax dot
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:24.820]   com or Seth are on the Twitter a show today brought to you by cap terra business software is kind of a kind of a funny
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:30.060]   Almost a ghetto in the software world, right? I mean there's a lot of money in business software
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.580]   But so often you go into a business and they're running programs that you know
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:36.380]   And they still have to use Windows XP and IE 8
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:43.340]   Because the program was written so long ago and it requires an old version of Windows. They suffer with that it crashes a lot
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:47.660]   I know we you know we've had that situation we went to cap terra and said is there anything better?
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.100]   Yes, it turns out there's this thing called salesforce. Have you ever heard of it?
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.100]   Cat terra is a directory of business software
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.020]   modern state-of-the-art
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:03.620]   functional business software there's great stuff out there for every business 700 categories
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.380]   thousands of programs
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:11.900]   Everything from you know digital workplace software video management software mailing list software
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:17.460]   But also things like church management software yoga studio management or there's even more
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:24.240]   sanctuary management so whatever your individual line of business is you can find software that will help you get the job done now
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.140]   You might say well there's an awful lot here. Well, here's the best part
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:33.780]   You can search for what you're looking for narrow it down. They've excellent filters that are tuned to exactly what your search is
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.140]   So narrow it down you want it on premises. Do you want it in the cloud?
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:41.420]   Do you have you want to make appointments with it? Just depending on what you kind of stuff you're
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:44.940]   Looking at you can compare for side by side
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:51.220]   So that you can you know see the features of each kind of like in the magazines where they have the side by side comparison chart
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.380]   But here's where cap terra really shines
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:59.420]   one million plus reviews of products from verified real users and
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.820]   There's a thousand new reviews every day
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:08.420]   That's because millions of people use cap terra to find business software and and because cap terra is free
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.380]   Yes, absolutely free
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:16.300]   I think a lot of people like to leave reviews because that's a way of kind of paying it forward in fact if you'd like to do that
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.900]   That would be awesome. There's a thousand new reviews every single day
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.980]   Captera believes software can make the world a better place because software can help every business
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:31.540]   Become a better version of itself. Why suffer with the worst software when the best is waiting for you capterra

[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:07.260]   Twit I still want to talk a little bit about Google because there's so much then they're talking about
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:14.780]   Yeah, including this new concept of ambient computing. Mm-hmm. So on twig we go and Stacy was very excited about this idea of ambient
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:19.660]   Oh, yeah, well she covers IOT and I gather well. Here's this here's
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:22.820]   What rich osterlo said when he opened
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:30.780]   The the event he's the vice president of device and services came from I really like rich he came from Motorola stayed when they sold off
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.900]   a Motorola
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:38.420]   Rick not rich Rick Osterlo said if you look across all of Google's products from search to maps Gmail the photos our mission is
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:41.580]   To bring a more helpful Google for you now
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:47.020]   This is by the way a little bit of a different mission from to organize the world's information and put it your fingertips
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:53.380]   But he says creating tools that help you increase your knowledge success health and happiness now when we apply that mission to hardware and services
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:58.460]   It means creating products like the phones the wearables the laptops nest each one is thoughtfully
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:05.380]   Responsibly designed to help you day-to-day without intruding on your life without intruding on your life in other words to be in the background
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.660]   ambient
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.660]   Anytime you need it just speak
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.340]   Go goes listening. That's my house
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:19.740]   Is that what ambient computing is it's computing in the background?
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:26.600]   Yeah, so this is this concept has been around since the 70s 80s 90 something like that's been around in computer science for a long
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.380]   Long time if you recall Andy Ruben's operating system was called the ambient OS
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:37.380]   So like the four and right it was called ambient OS well not before Android. This is this is after Google
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:44.420]   Oh for essential exactly that was the ambient OS but but the but the computer sciences have been knowing about this
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:48.160]   It's not just talking to a virtual assistant, but it's also lots of sensors
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:55.480]   That know what you're doing why you're doing it and sort of guide you along and it's kind of just the the computing is it's not just
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:02.220]   Input output through requesting searches. It's like you know having the thing to
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:07.000]   Sensor that knows when you're a little chilly and turning up the heat without even bothering you about it
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.440]   So it's like essentially being immersed in a world of sensors and computers that are
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:18.140]   AI is a key point and I remember this in the 70s and 80s and the problem was these sensors were massive you looked like a
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.280]   Robot walking around you know that well what's happening?
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.280]   I think you can give Apple credit for this because in mass producing the iPhone they've created a
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:31.500]   Industrial channel to make these things smaller and smaller and smaller cheaper and cheaper now
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:38.940]   Everything has sensors your car has sensors your house has everything there everywhere because they're so cheap right and but not just just now
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:42.220]   consumer devices are getting super intelligence and
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:46.220]   Sensors that are doing things and a great example it sounds like a trivial thing
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.780]   But it's actually really interesting from an ambient computing point of view
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:55.060]   But when you when your alarm goes off on a pixel 4 as you're reaching for it. It quiets down. It sees your hand
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:02.800]   So this thing about the psychological effect where your environment changes as you move around in 3d physical space based on AI
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.060]   That's and sensors that are like making these decisions
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:10.260]   We're gonna get super used to that the car starts when we're walking toward it the door opens and unlocks and opens
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:17.940]   Everything's just gonna start increasingly just adapting and changing and doing things for us automatically and we just would just feel like these
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:24.100]   All powerful beings walking around on Mount Olympus just like everything's you know and and by the way
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:31.100]   The the most common and oldest ambient computing device is the automatic door at the grocery store
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:38.440]   So we're all used to that we feel it feels if we walk up to an automatic door it doesn't open we walk into the glass
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.340]   Exactly and then when you wake up after
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:45.700]   Or you're a ghost right but it really is a new era and it's
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:51.660]   Google's right to be emphasizing this buzzword because it's actually going to be one of the most interesting things over the next
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:55.380]   Other products it sells the new nest mini
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:02.640]   Which is the second generation version of the first Google smart mini sports speaker and this one
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:07.420]   What's different about the mini so the nest mini in particular so the nest mini
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.020]   I you know have like an extra mic so that it can hear you if it's like really loud
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.780]   And also
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:17.300]   Speakers it sounded I heard it said much apparently I so I got one
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:21.500]   But I haven't because I'm moving houses. I haven't like plugged it in yet the base was really good
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.220]   Yeah, and which is good
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.260]   I mean they want to make it if it's a sub $50 device
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.740]   They want to make it something that you know feels like so they want you to have this in every room
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:33.700]   Yeah, it has a has a wall hook so you could put it on the wall and you just have it be this
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:40.420]   Part of your house like soap on the road. Yeah, have you used have used the soap on a rope hanging in every room of your house?
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:43.980]   Yes, I did. Okay, yes, I do it. It's like a talisman for him
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:50.260]   Have you used the hand gestures to control the the four? Yeah, I did on the demo units
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.540]   I'm not I'm super not into it. It's I mean to me
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:57.340]   I'm not sure I make hand gestures at my phone all the time. Yeah, but that that gesture
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:03.980]   So I think that's why solely is kind of interesting. It's radar. It's the first time we got radar in our devices
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:08.260]   I'm so excited about all this radar apples you one chip as a form of radar as well
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.260]   and both of these are going to be put into
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:16.740]   Verte augmented reality glasses when the augmented reality glasses look like regular glasses and it's really gonna
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.440]   Oh, look at that. She's nothing's happening. She's a witch
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:26.740]   So one criticism I've heard people say is that it these have to be fairly exaggerated gestures
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:32.080]   You can't walk on walks off. Yeah, you can't you can't you can't be elbow from the elbow up
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:37.820]   Yeah, we're all gonna get pixel elbow turn off a live caption cuz I create your own gestures
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:44.160]   Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm trying to look it up for you right now. I suspect that
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.240]   In every case and it's kind of like the grocery door is a really good example
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.080]   I'm glad you brought that up these companies move slowly with the capabilities because they want you to get used to the door
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:13:00.080]   Just opening yep, then then they add new features that you can make your own gestures
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:06.800]   Or although I have to say we still can't make our own trigger words for these smart devices, which drives me nuts. Yeah, you know
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:12.720]   You make your own commands if you as I have to teach me no, but I want I don't want to say hey goog
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.160]   Yeah, I'd like to be able to say all of our phones only buzz. Yeah, we used to do that in the Motorola
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.280]   It's not I mean that five years ago. I could do that. They can't do it now. I don't understand why not
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.280]   So the only gestures that are currently available
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:30.200]   From shipping is the one to skip songs which skips to the next or previous song cool
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:37.360]   Very nice screen and yeah, and this is just the full HD. This is not the quad HD of the XL
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:42.360]   90 Hertz refresh rate by the way, notice that if you'd like to scroll up and down
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.680]   You can you tell you can see yeah, I was watching Baywatch on this the other day
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:52.840]   It they have a channel on Pluto, so I was just like curious, you know, it's a baywatch channel
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.520]   Yeah, I'm yeah, all baywatch yeah 24/7 baywatch
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.800]   Yeah, let me tell you they don't know is save people in it sometimes people get eaten by sharks
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.200]   Like the episode that I watched
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:09.040]   But I was what I was just watching it to like test it and the speakers on this are really good
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.040]   They're like super
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.080]   super
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:22.760]   Definitely an upgrade I'm just it's more dense than the pixel 3. It's a different, you know, it feels like here's the thing about soul
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:29.560]   The people don't understand about solely so they're very tightly restricting under what circumstances it will accept different commands or whatever
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:35.000]   But there's no reason why this chip can't work from the back of the phone through your pants
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   And so people can be waving over their pants
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.720]   Goes through fabric it doesn't now because they've already officially restricted it
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.800]   There they could just turn that on and it would work that's how the initial demos were at Google
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.680]   I owe they should know call you a couple years ago and it was supposed to be a
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:53.680]   They're moving the watch by going like this like the watch was scrolling. It was like a little tiny violin
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.720]   Exactly, so you think they'll do that they'll slowly expand the capabilities as we get used to yes
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.720]   I think they will and I don't want it up to third party already just the phrase ambient computing
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.400]   Comes right up to the creepy line a little bit doesn't it especially because it's from Google?
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:13.000]   Oh, I do you know mine? I've been living with this stuff for two years now
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.320]   Yeah, and I it was so the other thing about the nest mini to add to that is they had mentioned that it's going to become a part of the
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   Nest security system
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.760]   So that basically the microphones will engage if something is going on
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.760]   so even if you don't have nest cameras that have microphones on them the
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.840]   Nest the cam the microphones in the nest mini is the smart
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.200]   Speakers will be able to listen in if there's an alarm going off
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:43.400]   And kind of let you know that there is something going on at your house that way the other thing they're doing is ecosystem play
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.840]   Right because all the nest stuff works better, but only with the other nest which is yeah
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   I replaced my ring doorbell
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.240]   With a hello doorbell and now when somebody rings my doorbell my nest hub
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:59.160]   Says someone's at the door and they and the one with the camera shows a picture
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:05.720]   And if it if they and by the way, this is the creepy line if they recognize the person they'll say Michael's at the door
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:13.360]   Well, you have to put that in now. Yes, do we want do we want the option in the future to be able to opt out of this?
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.840]   Yes, do we want the door or or the flip?
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:24.560]   No, but at some point all these things are going to be connected and you're going to be renting apartments or buying houses or whatever
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:31.360]   That have these things built in right and it's either going to be Amazon's ecosystem or apples or Googles or whatever
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.760]   Chinese manufacturer is not upsetting the rest of the world at the moment. Why is camera? Yeah, what's your address?
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.640]   I live on 612. Why way? Yeah, right?
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:47.280]   So it's interesting you say that because I so I'm was I am selling my house in the midst of it
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   And I had to take down a lot of stuff
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:57.600]   Because it's really creepy to have potential buyers walk into a house that has hot mics on it and hot cameras
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:03.320]   And which is why anyway, so all the cameras were taking offline
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:09.520]   I muted all the smart speakers in the house of which you can imagine like I have everything as a review unit
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.520]   So it's perfectly outfitted
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.000]   And it was upon request
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.520]   I also had to take down anything that we didn't want to include in the house because then people will want to have that as a part of like
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.360]   you know because you're selling it as a part of the package and
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:29.360]   People are still dubious about the idea of all this IOT in the home
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.560]   Yeah, just having hot mics and you know the problem with that though is that the microphones will
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:42.560]   Inevitably end up on our bodies instead of being sprinkled around the house and will each have our own individual microphone that which is our track
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:50.280]   A lot of the ambient computing stuff is happening in the in the in the hearable type devices and Google's earbuds is one example
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:56.120]   But that but this is a an even more impressive example is a product called the Jabra Elite 85H
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:01.280]   Right basically it turns up and down the ambient sound based on what it very recognizes
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.480]   So if it hears traffic it figures well, you're walking into traffic
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.840]   You probably should hear these cars coming at you
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.160]   So let's turn that up and then you walk into a coffee shop
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.440]   It's like well, you're probably gonna want to work
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.760]   So we'll turn that down my gearbuds kind of work like that too
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.720]   So I can hear what's going on around me while also, you know
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.280]   So I know the conversations around me on transit when I'm also like rocking out
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.880]   But this is the new world where where AI
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.960]   Recognizes things in your environment and adjust things on your behalf automatically. This is ambient computing
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:32.560]   That's what the camera does in the pixel for the whole point of the camera in the pixel for is that it has all of that
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:39.200]   Machine learning smarts the you know the the computer is doing all of the work that your DSLR
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.760]   you usually have to do manually to kind of get the results that you wanted and
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.360]   it's it's
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.080]   And to your concern I don't think if history is any guide
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:56.080]   They're not going to care that much or they're really going to be against the idea of giving people control the whole all this one
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.200]   These wonderful benefits come at the loss of control, right?
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.160]   So all this stuff is gonna be happening automatically
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.760]   I mean even look at something as trivial as in on Twitter where you can see the latest tweets recently
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.460]   There's a lot of demand for that so they put it in there grudgingly and then automatically it reverts the other one
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:16.400]   They really really really don't want you to have control over your Twitter feed none of these companies want you to have control over any
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.520]   Of this stuff because that's not where the money is that's not where the algorithms
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.160]   You know they want to be able to just like have this automatic thing going all the time
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:28.820]   And they don't want nerves like you and me basically saying okay like I want to be in control of this. Yeah, so I
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:34.440]   Earlier last week I had the opportunity to try on not ride
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:39.000]   But try on a new motorcycle helmet made by a company an Australian company called foresight
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.800]   And once we got past the jokes about their internet and and our health care
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:48.900]   You know suicidal bushes. Yeah, well
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:52.520]   Homicidal but anyway, so so you know
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:58.640]   one of the pieces of tech that they've put into this thing which is really really interesting is that you turn it on and
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.960]   It scans ways and Google Maps and other
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:10.120]   Systems to see if there is law enforcement in the area if there is a traffic incident in the area
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:15.040]   Notice I said incident not accident ask me about that later and
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:23.880]   If there's construction going on if there's any kind of road related thing if there's and eventually it's supposed to be able to tell if
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:31.200]   People have been avoiding a particular lane or something and use that to warn riders that
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.360]   There's some there's something going on in that lane and you should be prepared to to evade it
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:40.000]   Maybe it's a branch. Maybe you know something else in the middle of the lane
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.320]   It's it's something that you would think motorcyclists would really want right you want to know these things and invent
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.680]   So what I think yeah
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.920]   But by it by it's a community that is heavily populated by
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:21:00.920]   People who are skeptical of anything that tells them what to do or how to do it
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.000]   interesting and and so I'm wondering if
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.080]   There's going to be at some point some kind of backlash where people are just gonna look at this stuff
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:18.280]   It's not gonna matter who comes up with it. They're just gonna look at it and say nah, you know, I don't want this
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.280]   I don't need this
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:25.280]   Won't they be at a disadvantage though to those of us who do say we want this and need this well
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:30.760]   Might be a disadvantage for not having an Apple watch there'll be a dad. I mean serious serious is a
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:35.560]   Do you do you feel like there's a hole in your life because you don't have some kind of watch?
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.660]   I feel people are staring at me. They are saying why doesn't have an Apple watch is
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:48.720]   That's why I don't want the pixel buds by the way like I don't want it listening
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:54.200]   I don't want the Google assistant in my ear when I'm out on the trail like I want to be left alone when I'm on the trail
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:22:00.480]   Yeah, what you guys be the luddites of this generation what you and those people well then I go home and I walk in
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.900]   But that's hello flow is that avenge you're gonna win in the long run is my point, right?
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:10.240]   And that those of you yes or holdouts are simply gonna look like you were just kind of luddites
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:15.200]   It will be a generational thing young people just use of the stuff I don't know because
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:19.760]   Facebook was supposed to be the great arbiter of social networks and
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.600]   I don't know if you guys were aware of this but a lot of young people
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:29.920]   Have stopped using Facebook Facebook is to them what my space is to us
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:35.640]   Or friends or friends Facebook is a baby boomer product is sure Tom is very happy here
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:42.400]   I'm sure they use they use they use Instagram not just for for sharing photos still on Facebook
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:49.800]   Then they you well yeah, but they don't know that but but but there you but what they're using Instagram for is to send messages to each other as
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.640]   Comments on photos and then they delete the photos
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:57.000]   It's no accident though that they're using Instagram that Facebook owns Instagram
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.080]   I think Mark Zuckerberg very cannaly said we're buying what's happened. We're buying Instagram
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:05.960]   So that we will always and I think they'll buy the next they tried to buy snapchat couldn't do sure
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:12.600]   But but there's but I think I think there's there's already the idea right whether or not Zuckerberg actually owns these things
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.320]   There's the idea of people saying we're not going for the obvious product
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:22.040]   We're going to do an end run and they're using Instagram in ways that they that Facebook wasn't intending
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.960]   Instagram itself wasn't intending Instagram I'd be used also you secret Google Docs by the
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.760]   writer or or or what's his name?
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.920]   Patreus who who got nabbed because he was communicating with his lover over
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:39.840]   Gmail draft. I mean oh my god. That's incredible
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.400]   This is by the way the story of technology
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:49.360]   Yeah, this is this this is what's wonderful about technology is the people who create technologies very often misunderstand how it'll be used
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:53.960]   The users end up defining it look at Twitter. There was no ad symbol. There was no hashtag
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:59.800]   It evolved and it became better because yeah users a users invented all that stuff
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.480]   So it's all about the users is really what we're saying
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:07.760]   I think what Mike and I are saying is the world's gonna change whether you are a
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:14.560]   Independent-minded motorcycle rider or not sure but I think I think that people are going
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.960]   there's going to be a growing number of people who look at this stuff and
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:25.440]   Either use it in ways that were never intended and reject the standard default features in ways that
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:31.960]   Push them more and more into the realm of what we would consider to be hacking rather than just tweaking it or whatever or
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:34.640]   There's people who's gonna look at it and say no, right?
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:39.320]   Absolutely not and I mean we don't why Mark Zuckerberg's impressive
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:45.400]   He saw this coming and he bought insta-g- he tried to buy snapjack couldn't bought Instagram made it look like snapchat
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.960]   Yeah, pretty much killed snapchat, right?
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:52.840]   That's that's a smart mogul snapchat has moved to by the way more
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:59.160]   It's more content focused like it's that's what they kept trying to do right? I know but now it's like I
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:08.120]   Don't know kids. So yeah, I still see a lot of teens on there. Yeah, there's it's still like it's mostly about the doggy pictures in the vomiting rainbow stuff
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:15.080]   No Instagram took that over actually. Yeah. Yeah. There's an Instagram program called threads that
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:24.440]   Is basically snapchat the stories does dissolving messages is snapchat the close friends thread the close friends filter on Instagram now is the new way to
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:31.440]   securely share photos of your children if you don't want to put your children public facing on Instagram perfect
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.640]   So yeah, I mean
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.800]   I don't know if I want to talk anymore about Mark Zuckerberg, but
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.920]   How how did he do he did a Georgetown speech on free speech?
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:53.240]   They got some sorry I love that's just my he got some pans on some some did anybody appreciate that no
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.160]   What was he trying to do here? He was trying to put Facebook on the right side?
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:05.720]   45 minute a speech making his case for internet services. I want to talk to his hand free speech
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:14.440]   I want to hear how he is being said Mark's handler. I would ask what are you telling Mark first of all like nobody tells Mark
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.120]   nothing
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.240]   Right, I mean probably that's probably it like is it is it?
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:27.960]   We're gonna have to watch this guy grow up. Yeah in real time. We are we have been real
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:33.200]   I mean I've been with him since college. He was if I could talk to his handler. I'd say listen Priscilla
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:41.440]   No, he's he so my my universal theory of Mark Zuckerberg is that he actually lack
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.080]   He's like not only colorblind, but he's colorblind
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:50.400]   Ethically like he can't see that's correct. What's ethical and what isn't ethical? He just can't tell the difference. He's not evil
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:57.000]   He just can't doesn't know that it's able not immoral exactly stupid, but you can't say he's stupid because he's
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.760]   He's doing all right. I
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:06.580]   Don't think I don't think I'm just a network to get all the hot chicks on campus. So clearly he knew how to rally
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:12.380]   That's the social network movie view of why Mark Zuckerberg. I know but it's a much more interesting story
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:21.460]   They were already together he had a girlfriend great score for that movie
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:26.780]   I know I want I want to know what the air is working version of my life. No, it's a it's a Trent Reznor
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:31.780]   Atticus Ross. Yeah, it's the nine inch nails sanitized version
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:39.520]   Alright, I want to take a bit more. I love it. I'm so bored with Mark. Yeah, I'm tired of talking about Mark
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.780]   Yeah, do you think his day is over?
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:45.880]   No, I think unfortunately not no
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.180]   Do you think that Facebook is doing what it needs to do to prevent?
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:53.300]   election tampering in 20
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:59.540]   We know we know that they're not we've had worse than Facebook now by the way. It goes beyond just
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:06.060]   Always it's always been beyond Facebook. Yeah, I mean so so there's three main things that that to prevent election
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:10.460]   Tampering right we need to be doing one is focusing on how
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.700]   physical voting
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:19.180]   Machines are dealing with votes and that requires paper ballots that requires risk limiting audits
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:27.100]   Which are not being mandated in most places, California is but it's a it's a there's a very few states that are mandating them
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.500]   For you what the third is but
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:37.780]   You know the we're simply not doing enough on on the actual ballot site on the online side when you have an organization
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:43.580]   With as much reach as Facebook that that throws up their hands and says we're not going to deal with
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.740]   lies
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:48.740]   Coming from politicians in the middle of campaign season. I
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:55.380]   Mean utter utter nonsense. Would it be somebody proposed John Constantine and tech crunch proposed that Facebook?
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.180]   Just not sell political ads
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:05.060]   Middly they're turning their back on some a significant amount of revenue, but they have plenty of other sources of revenue if they didn't sell ads
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:14.220]   Pardon me tick-tock does that yeah? No ads you could still you could still have a you know a Tulsi gabbard page and put stuff up there
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:19.420]   Right, but you couldn't buy an ad which would eliminate the whole this is John Constantine's piece in tech crunch
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:22.340]   You would eliminate the whole issue wouldn't it would that solve it?
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:29.380]   I would be happy with some sort of national law that said that any sort of algorithmically determinant
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:35.700]   Political advertisement is banned so you can you can do billboards you can do TV commercials
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:41.980]   But if you're secretly giving like a hundred million people a hundred million different versions of an ad that's already going on
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:46.540]   Yeah, I'm campaign-spelling a million dollars a week. Absolutely. Yes book ads right now, right?
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:49.940]   It's all under the radar. Nobody knows what you know what it's funny
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:55.660]   It's true because the one ad that Trump put on tried to put on all the networks CNN was the only network
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:59.380]   It was used to run it. Yeah got a lot of heat a lot of attention
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:06.220]   And in a way drew all the attention away from the fact that's probably they're doing the same thing or worse on Facebook
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:10.900]   But you're not seeing it because they're right. That's right. That's right. You know we I think we sort of touched on this
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:13.140]   last month when I was on but
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:14.900]   when
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.980]   the
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:20.060]   Deep fake video about in Nancy Pelosi
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:26.660]   Was you know that that came out over the summer was banned by YouTube the Internet's you know
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:29.620]   co-branded cesspool and
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:31.900]   Was not banned by Facebook
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:38.940]   You know that that sort of puts into relief like how utterly chaotic if there's anything that needs regulation
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:45.900]   I think when it comes to to Internet and technology this would be a great place to start just take the money out of political ads
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:50.620]   From from social networks. I understand Facebook's point of view
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:56.180]   Which is we don't want to weigh in on the truth or false, but then they're weighing in because it's a nonsense
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:31:01.740]   Gorgon by by not acting they're acting well. We're just a platform the phone company is not expected to
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:09.700]   Monitor calls for lies. We're just a platform whenever whenever you're in a situation where the power holder the people with the most money
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:14.140]   Are allowed to do whatever they want then you have no
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:20.100]   Restraints on whatever they can do and it favors the powerful and it doesn't favor those who are out of power
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:24.960]   It doesn't favor those who are downtrodden doesn't favor those who don't have other means of
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.580]   participating in the conversation
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:36.740]   You don't see people on Facebook spending millions of dollars of ads so that San Francisco has navigation centers or homeless shelters
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:41.860]   But that's what it needs right you need that it needs to be a shift in public thinking
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:46.780]   That's why you buy advertising and when you only allow the powerful to participate
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:52.740]   Then you are putting your finger on on the scale also if you have a political advertising
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:59.460]   Legislative world where the rules apply to some media and there are no rules in the other media
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:03.500]   because we've for some reason left it up to the frat boy then
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:11.220]   You know all the all the dirty politics goes to that platform. Yeah, Zuckerberg gets all the money becomes a magnet
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:19.180]   Macedonian teenagers pick our next president and it's like, you know, it's not the G. The GRE who picks our next president exactly that's
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:22.980]   Let's take a break Macedonian teenagers wish they were that
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:31.440]   Bad for Macedonian teenagers our show today. Oh actually before we do that do we have a promo before we do the wasabi
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:37.700]   We do not we can very very busy preparing for someone's vacation. So somebody gets to go on vacation
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:43.100]   Oh, I'm jealous. Yeah, I should I should probably mention that I won't be here next week next week
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:47.460]   We're gonna do an all-twit host show because we don't have to pay them freelance fees
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:52.900]   So it'll be Jason and and Micah hosting Twitter
[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:58.660]   They could fight over who gets to be in charge who gets the one health care package who gets the health care package
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:03.780]   And sit in the big chair even more valuable than a good health care package. They're all really tall too
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:09.580]   Sit in the big chair. I don't understand what's gone wrong with our hiring process. They're all taller than me
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:12.420]   I don't know that should be a lot. I know where yeah
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:16.740]   Mm-hmm something has gone horribly wrong
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:22.700]   Then the following week is it Lindsay Turrentine the following week the following week will be Jason Snell
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:29.980]   And the week following that then Lindsay Turrentine and so we've got gonna have a lot of fun on Twitter
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:33.260]   And then I will be back on the November for the November
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:37.740]   9/16 17th show November 17th show
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:43.860]   I am I have Keith says in the chatroom. I've developed Little Man syndrome
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:46.900]   I'm not a little man, but I'm a little ear man
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:50.100]   then them our show today brought to you by
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:57.020]   Wasabi hot cloud storage if you're thinking about moving your data storage to the cloud and everybody is these days in fact
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:03.700]   Gartner estimated by 20 25 80 percent of business will just have shut down their local data centers
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.940]   80 percent 10 percent now 80 percent in five years
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:14.940]   That means a hundred sixty three zettabytes of data will be migrated to the cloud by 2025. It's not a real number
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:21.820]   Sounds like I'm making it up bazillion gazillion. It's uh, it's 163 followed by 21 zeros I
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.060]   counted them
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:26.380]   It's a lot of bites those zettabytes
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:32.980]   So it's clear that it's gonna be important cloud storage can be more important than ever and I think unfortunately a lot of people go
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:37.100]   Oh, just use Amazon or all you just maybe you just use Microsoft
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:40.500]   Nobody said all you just use Google, but that would be the third choice
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:46.700]   I want to give you a fourth choice that you actually should use and this is wasabi hot cloud storage
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:48.700]   now, I know this is a tough sell because
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:52.980]   You never heard of them. So let me tell you why you want wasabi first of all
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.660]   They have a patented process for writing data on
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:02.460]   Dissequentially as opposed to in blocks they pat they created this when they were back at carbonite and now Jeff flowers and David
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:12.020]   Friend have created wasabi enterprise class cloud storage that is 80% cheaper than Amazon and up to six times faster
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:20.820]   Faster and cheaper. Okay, that's pretty good. They don't charge for egress Amazon does and they use the Amazon S3 API
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:26.300]   So you already know how to use it, but they don't charge unlike Amazon. They don't charge for API requests. So it's more affordable
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.300]   It's very flexible. It's faster
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:32.460]   11 nines of durability. That's the highest you can get
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:38.400]   They also do integrity checking regularly they rotate through all the files
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.260]   Make sure not one bit is changed and then you can even declare and this is really good nowadays
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:46.260]   With ransomware you can even declare some are all of your storage immutable
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:53.940]   That means it cannot be modified by ransomware by fungal fingered employees not intentionally not accidentally it's safe
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.260]   Of course data center redundancy
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:59.900]   It's HIPAA compliant FINRA compliance EJIS compliant
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:05.860]   Honestly wasabi is just as secure in some cases even more secure than on-prem storage and
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:09.900]   Yet still people will go oh, yeah, okay Amazon
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:14.460]   No, you got to remember wasabi all I'm asking is when you go present to the boss you say and boss
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:17.020]   There's this one more thing just one more thing
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:24.260]   80% cheaper six times faster 11 nines of durability immutable storage no charge for egress no charge for API requests
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.060]   It's wasabi you want to bang on it
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:30.660]   We're gonna give you unlimited storage for a month when you go to wasabi WAS
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:36.820]   ABI.com offer code to it unlimited free storage for a month you can really just
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.800]   Burn that stuff up just do everything you can wasabi.com offer code to it. I
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:51.580]   Thank wasabi so much and I really am a big fan of David and Jeff over there and thank them so much for believing in us enough
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.820]   To introduce wasabi to you through our
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:58.780]   Podcasts I invite you to support twit by going to wasabi.com and using the offer code
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:02.760]   Twit yeah, Google's announced that they're not gonna allow unlimited
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:07.660]   Storage for pixel 4 photos are gonna be I phone users will not be affected
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:13.220]   No, but anybody who bought the pixel 3 the pixel 2 the OG pixel that you had unlimited
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:17.380]   Storage of a wide I don't want to get rid of the pixel 3. Yeah, so I still have it
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:23.300]   You do through your I get a pixel 4 and then as it go away apparently it's because the iPhone
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:26.580]   Is is lower
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:33.860]   It's only pictures you took on the iPhone. Yes, you get you unlimited. Yes
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:38.900]   Unlimited storage I didn't even know I was getting unlimited storage. Yeah, it's because they don't
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:46.900]   Efficiency image codec. Yeah, they leave those be iPhone if you take it on the iPhone if you take it on pixel 3
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:50.340]   They don't mess with it. It's digital in fact even if it's raw, right?
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:55.660]   I leave it if you take it on a pixel 3a or a pixel 4 you do not get unlimited
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:38:01.100]   So this is the new way what they're gonna do this from right and it makes me nervous because are they feeling the heat of
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:03.660]   Just
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:12.300]   Not when you're talking about trillions of photos a year being added he's buying the pixel
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:19.620]   I just it makes me so nervous because they kill they kill products and services like it's a bodily function if they were to ever
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:26.120]   Nobody has can could download nobody even cares nobody even cares nobody even and the problem is they do see that headline
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:30.780]   And now they care that Google this is silly. It's just so I care. You know what they're engineers
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:37.860]   No, no, we do care. I'm saying we care it Google nobody Google cares because they're engineers in fact Ben Thompson has a great article
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:42.500]   about Google in which he says the real problem is that
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:47.340]   The their engineers they feel like you should just know what we're doing
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:50.020]   We don't need to really market it
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:56.660]   He says Google from its founding has succeeded simply by being better and letting the masses figure it out for themselves
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:00.440]   It completely worked to Google search was better than anything else in the market, right?
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.900]   By virtue of being on the internet was immediately accessible to anyone zero marginal cost basis
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:11.420]   We all said we all found it. We all went to Google everybody started using Google the company struggles though
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.580]   This is again Ben Thompson's trajectory when it actually has to sell something
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:23.060]   Look no farther than Google Cloud Platform a distant third to Amazon and Microsoft the company is currently trying to brute force its way into contention
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:26.380]   Hiring a VP from Oracle a whole bunch of salespeople
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:34.780]   But those efforts will run up against the company since that simply building better stuff should be enough did our Chromebooks terrible?
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:37.620]   No, they're great. You're using one. Yeah
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:41.580]   Four of us I'm using a witness machine
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:45.580]   But but the point is is that they they actually do build some things
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:50.700]   That when the mark it's not saying that no, that's no, they're not saying he's not saying they build bad stuff
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:54.060]   But they don't know how to sell it they marketed the Chromebook
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:58.460]   Yeah, because they put it into schools and they got the kids on it and the kids know it very well
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:05.260]   And the kids brought it home and the parents go my kid uses a Chromebook and then the kid goes to college and the kid goes and gets
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:11.740]   Himself a pixel book go in either not pink or black and then they go wow. This is a four-case screen
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:14.380]   Oh scandal looks so good on this
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:18.940]   So Thompson says and maybe maybe he's wrong. I mean he's been wrong
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:26.180]   Google has to he's very smart. He's been wrong Google has to get better at all parts of the funnel from initial awareness to
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:31.460]   Education to conversion to channel to distribution to support however
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:35.700]   There's not much evidence the companies made progress in any of these areas when he says education
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:42.300]   He means educating people right in the education market and given how strong the companies core business remains not much motivation to either
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:44.580]   He says they're doing so fine in search and ad sales on search
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:52.060]   They don't need to succeed. I mean, isn't that a hot take from 2010? It's a hot take from that bad event made by Google 2019
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:57.740]   Sure, but that's they didn't even barely put any effort into it. They didn't sell anything. It was boring
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:03.980]   Well, they sold an ecosystem. They sold ambient the idea says the thing with visions. They're easy to come up with right
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:10.740]   Harder to articulate even more difficult to build. It's the selling though that requires dedication. He says Google lacks that
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:16.460]   No, you disagree Seth? I just I see their bottom line and I'm not sure that that's an accurate read
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:20.460]   But the bottom line comes entirely from sale from searching certain ads
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:23.300]   Is it I mean, aren't they doing?
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:31.340]   Close hardly at least if not a billion on on hardware. That's just software installs
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:37.900]   That's the thing is like there's a billion Android users, maybe two billion out there
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:44.620]   But that's again facilitated by all these hardware partners that they work with it's not really Google doing that
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:47.260]   I mean the reason Android is such a big deal
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:53.500]   I would say in North America is because of Samsung and all the other manufacturers that came through and put all that money behind
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:57.780]   Marketing because when you think about like when I see what Apple does what it's marketing is
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:04.860]   It's so much better than what Google doesn't even Samsung like gets on that train the picture really quick
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:07.340]   The Pixel 3 sold worse than the Pixel 2
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:13.660]   The Pixel 3 until they released the 3a if they realized whoops, maybe we need to make a less expensive one
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:15.780]   But that had an edge the Pixel 3 sold
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:21.500]   In its entire year less than Apple sold iPhones in two weeks
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:24.380]   So no, they're not a player in hardware
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:30.740]   No, but the point I'm making is that their hardware is always in service of whatever software service it is that they're pitching
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:35.140]   They don't I mean it's not that they don't care about the hardware, but it's just not their big big concern
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.140]   so
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:39.340]   you know and in looking at some of the adoption rates of
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:45.020]   Of their products it who cares about the hardware when you've got an in it
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:49.060]   And I think it's over two billion or very close to two billion now using Android
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:58.900]   It doesn't they make money on every Android install though not every not every but the fact that the largest OS in history means that it's very difficult for
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:04.060]   companies like Huawei to come up with an alternative to replace them because they're kind of irreplaceable
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:11.540]   I do think it has to be said that the the pixel line of laptops and Chromebooks generally
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:17.660]   Maybe not Google's own pixels are going to do I think it's very likely that they're going to do in the corporate
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:22.840]   Client market what they did in education the rubber bottom one the grippy rubber bottom one you like that
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.700]   Everybody loves a grippy rubber bottom
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:28.540]   It's grippy. It's grippy on the pixel book go to by the way, and it's a very pretty grippy
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:32.700]   I'm talking about as a pixel book go that little ridgy. Yes, but it reminds me
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:39.420]   You know it reminds me of what the black MacBook Pro back in the day. Yeah, those are super sweet line
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:44.180]   I'm gonna buy this computer. It's only offensive you go out and get an ace or for half the college kids bought
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:50.820]   MacBooks like crazy back in my exact all these long ago all these parents that are lying and cheating to get their kids in Harvard
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:51.820]   They're gonna buy Matt
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:58.540]   Felicially hushman's already bought like seven so I can you can order him from prison Victor came up to me in the hall and said
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:03.460]   Carson should I buy this for my son who's going to to college and I said yeah sure
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:06.700]   Yeah, I think there are better
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:11.980]   Chromebooks than the pixel book go men. I think they're many no the pixel book go is really nice
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:16.380]   It's the thing is it's it's doesn't have fingerprint doesn't have it doesn't matter it has great speakers
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:22.260]   It has a great screen. It has a very comfortable quiet keyboard. It's very it's much lighter than this
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:26.220]   You can actually easily pick it up like a like a tray like you're serving
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:30.700]   It's a really as flows as it's a really really ideal college student device
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:36.660]   It's the 4k screen, but the 4k screen and the sound quality is optimized for that's your TV
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:42.660]   Mm-hmm, and and everything else about it's great for it's lighter a little lighter than this thing
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:44.340]   Which is the pixel book?
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:46.620]   The pixel book I think is a superior device
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:51.620]   But that one also comes with a core is seven if you want to pay that much money and you want to you know
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:56.540]   Get into development. I'll tell you that much money. Yeah, but wait a minute the pixel book go
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:04.340]   With the M3 a really crappy processor 8 gigs of RAM is 64 gigs of sorts is six hundred forty nine dollars
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:08.460]   Still cheaper than but it's not cheaper than anything except a Mac
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:16.300]   They're going after I love against with college kids. Well every college kid has a has a has a
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:20.720]   MacBook you can get to 1399 and a pixel book
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.740]   Go if you put an i7 16 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs storage in it
[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:30.180]   And I would argue that you'd be better off with a Mac book. It does a lot more than a pixel book does
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:38.240]   I loved Kevin Tofol's theory on on on twig where he said basically the pixel book go is the is the pixel
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:44.820]   Slate bolted into the yes. Yes. That's what it is. It is literally. That's the screen
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:46.940]   They maybe should have done because that yeah
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:53.620]   It's a puzzle. Yeah to me. Yeah, it's a puzzle. I'm not sure I understand what Google's going for
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:58.620]   I'm not sure if it's us that it's going for no, okay. Well, we'll see if it's going to roof
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:02.100]   They're going to think of the children's the grippy rubber bottom
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:07.980]   Which is the as far as I can tell the only distinguishing factor on this thing is that what makes them want it besides what it lacks
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:15.380]   I mean the the high-end model has half the storage of the pixel book, right? Yeah, it doesn't support the pen
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:20.660]   Yeah, it's out or it's out or it's a it's a limited more limited thing and it's not that's a good thing much cheaper
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:25.680]   No, but that's why Martha Stewart was there, but but but I love the pixel by the way the pixel phone
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:30.760]   Oh, yeah, I got the inside scoop. Why was she there? She loves the phone. She's a huge fan
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:36.520]   She's like if I had this in prison this would have been she does she did she was fine in prison, please
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.840]   She had her own shower and everything
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:43.980]   Anyway, she can afford a lot of sleep. I've seen oranges that are black. It's good. She had her own shower
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:49.200]   I'm just saying because it was orange new black is that the new TV show about the pixel for yeah
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:55.200]   I ordered the orange one because I want to be different a lot of people are not happy about that color
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.840]   I don't think it's bad. I want it it matches it matches sets
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:01.680]   Kind of actually it's a little
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.320]   Less
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:08.640]   Burnt did you say yes? It's like a it's like a brown orange. I looked at it
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.920]   So so I got the I got the pixel three last year and I looked and I'm on fine
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:18.600]   I looked at trading it in and doing the whole thing and then I saw the pitons that they were going to offer me I
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:24.960]   Know and I just shut that browser window and went into three as I'd rather do a show
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:33.240]   Craigslist they offered so little for it for for upgrading like if it had been two to three hundred I would have considered it but they
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.720]   Less than that
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:41.720]   Oh, no, it was two to three hundred that they offered but that still only takes it down to just wait three months
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:46.480]   And you'll be able to get a four and a half the cost if I wait a year I'll get a pixel five
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:53.600]   Everybody knows that Google discounts sharply. Yeah, very rapidly. Yeah. Well, I got my pixel three for free
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:48:00.480]   They basically discount it like a two hour windows where they would give you vouchers
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.960]   Right, I live in Airbnb's and one of the vouchers was for Airbnb
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.960]   So it was like an eight hundred dollar voucher
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:09.320]   For an eight hundred dollar phone tell you the free phone but to sell these things. Yeah
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.060]   Marilyn would like you find but we have that story
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:14.400]   Because they learned from their mistake
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:19.400]   We got haunted by the ghost of Marilyn Monroe. I must have missed that I dropped it right in front of where she died
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.280]   The Palm Springs home and it's because I was talking talking a little talking smack about the Marilyn
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:30.880]   Yeah, she heard me and I dropped my phone. She was a candle in the wind. Oh my god. Yeah, no
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:33.440]   It's like all it's a whole thing on all about it's yeah
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:36.680]   It's I'm never talk ill of the dead because that's what happens
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:42.480]   So besides the pixel book go there's also the smart speakers. I think we're forgetting
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.400]   The whole Google strategy what's that in terms of I
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:53.960]   Love the Google Hall max. I think they should make more of those not little ways to get the nest Wi-Fi. Oh, yeah
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:58.680]   The nest Wi-Fi which is a speaker and Wi-Fi together. Well if you want to do if you want to buy that one
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:00.680]   Um, I didn't know there were choices
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:06.920]   There should be choice because that's the last thing I need is for my I got speakers everywhere already
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:14.480]   I mean exactly isn't it just a upgraded Google Wi-Fi they call it nest. It's kind of upgraded. So not all the nodes have
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:21.920]   The nodes that are the connectors not the main node if the base node. Yeah, not the base node
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.920]   From what I understand does not have an ethernet plug in it
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:30.980]   So that is the big thing for me because I hardwire a lot of my IOT
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:33.880]   Unusual the most people they have one router
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:35.400]   That's what and that's what Google said
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.440]   But I think you shouldn't take that away from people because you're just assuming that that people
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.600]   You know even the arrow, you know the original arrows had ethernets at the bottom
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:50.320]   But now they don't either I mean I think that they just look at the market and they say because people aren't because we aren't I guess
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.960]   I'm not educating people enough to tell them they should hardwire these things because Wi-Fi is just
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:00.040]   It's not always the best but uh, how about the
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:02.840]   the automatic
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.000]   transcription of recording on the memo
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:12.320]   So I haven't I know Lauren good was a huge is is a huge fan of that. She's tweeting a lot about that this week
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:17.520]   I've been using live caption a lot. Yeah, there's also otter AI. I use that on the iOS
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:24.280]   But this is all done on device. Yeah, I kind of like that. Yeah. Yeah, this has been coming on at random on my phone
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.280]   And it's disturbing
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:32.000]   I have a three I'm saying that yeah, and it just it just it just starts transcribing
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.920]   What are you using live transcribed the I think it's live function. I think it's like I don't know what it is because
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:43.240]   Suddenly there's a screen on my phone that's yeah, yeah, that's like you said
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:48.880]   Hey Google and then as after you say hey Google. I said hey Google. It's not doing it
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.880]   But if it's did it
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:57.920]   I just set off a thousand devices
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:05.240]   But if you accidentally say trigger it it will then continue to transcribe
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:12.040]   It happens with and then somebody out in overseas will be studying it to give information
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:16.760]   This is gonna freak out a lot of people so I know it's not first of all
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:22.080]   It's on its on phone right they shrunk the machine learning down so the transcription is on amazing
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:26.720]   Programming feet by the way, and we had an interview with the folks who did that
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:29.160]   I don't know about Android if you want to go back to that Google I
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:31.160]   Time it's nice archives
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:36.540]   All right, so you thought you didn't have a promo video. I have a promo video
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:45.860]   This week on all about Android all about cross promotion all about cross promotion
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:49.280]   Let's see what else
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:52:00.000]   How about the pseudo flaw Seth is that a big deal SUDO let's use Linux users run commands that a big deal no
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:06.980]   Is it - well you have to have in your okay now we're gonna really get geeky for a minute in your pseudo
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:09.240]   Or is shut that you have to in your suit owners
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:11.080]   demand file
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:16.040]   Have an app that you could then trigger. I mean most people that will not affect them
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:22.320]   But I agree. I mean you shouldn't I'll be allowed. I mean the whole problem was if you have a user ID - 1
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:26.080]   That it will roll over and then su do
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:31.160]   Do you say pseudo I would say pseudo it's supposedly it's as you do as you do
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.980]   Which I really hate as you do. It's like Jeff, right? Yeah
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:42.000]   Anyway, if you pseudo - 1 then you can then any any any app can
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.640]   Then be a root and you can have it. Yes, it's not good
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:55.480]   it also sounds like they're fixing it and and so and it also won't affect most people because it runs on Linux and the number of
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.840]   People the number of people who it affects is is tiny and it doesn't sound like it can be scaled up to Android
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:03.900]   Unless you've rooted in dundraings, so she's Linux
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:10.240]   The Air Force has retired 8 inch floppies. That's a good thing
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:14.160]   Too soon too soon the joke is too soon
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:19.880]   So they are they were using IBM series one 8 inch floppies 50 years
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.080]   They're finally
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:25.880]   Retiring them when they miss a launch control system to replace them with quote solid state stories
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:32.360]   I finally got money from the government to replace that stuff because that's the only reason they were to using that old school stuff
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:38.720]   I'm telling you in my in the minority when I say that I think it's good that things like miss a launch systems are
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:42.320]   based on really old technology they're gonna use smart missile launch
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.760]   Oh my gosh
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:50.800]   Please run DOS. They're still using the series one. It's actually predates DOS. They're not using DOS
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:53.560]   They're moving to DOS
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.720]   Oz is a little too modern
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:57.640]   Sorry
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.640]   the GAO
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:08.720]   In 2016 said the Air Force plans to update its data storage solution port expansion processors portable terminals and desktop terminals by the end of
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:17.040]   2017 we've got all the cloud there. No, you definitely okay. I will grant you that you do not want missile launch control in the cloud
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.200]   No, you do not have it be launched with hey Google are you gonna use your
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:27.200]   I said it
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:36.200]   Is that me I turned that off - I don't know why that happened I want to be at the ATM machine
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:41.040]   When it gets infected with the malware that makes it spit cash out. Yes, please
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:51.200]   Motherboard and then run broad fat caster Bay ratio and funk have just uncovered new details about they call it jackpotting
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.200]   I think that's a good name. That's beautiful
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:55:02.720]   10 a.m. Rights, Joseph Cox on a late November morning in Fryburg, Germany a bank employee knows something was wrong with the bank
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.040]   ATM it had been hacked with a malware called cut-lit maker
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:14.520]   That is designed to make ATMs eject all of my inside of them and their euros choose so they're worth more than a dollars
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:20.440]   The control panel reads ho ho ho let's make some cutlets today
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:24.760]   alongside cartoon images of a chef and a cheering piece of meat
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:32.440]   Apparently it's a play on words because in Russian maybe you know this flow a cutlet not only means a cut of meat
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:38.320]   Language by the way, but I but I bundle a lot of language no a Latin language. I don't speak Romanian
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.320]   Yeah, so I don't understand
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:43.920]   It's a Latin
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:52.080]   So apparently that's all there is to say about it. I just like it, but here he is here's the chef actually that chef boy
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.280]   R.D. I was gonna I recognize that straight out of the yeah
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:59.880]   Well, you know capitalism he made it over there. Oh, oh, oh
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.720]   Let's make some cutlets. They should be really more ho ho ho I like mr.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.840]   So some goodlets today, what's interesting in the story
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:10.720]   Joe
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.320]   Remembered Barnaby Jack's hack at black had demonstrating this
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:18.960]   Yeah, I was in 2010 so I was there for that. I remember that yeah, that was a
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:23.120]   That was I think my first black hat actually which was
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:29.080]   quite intense to suddenly see an ATM spitting fake catch with Barnaby's face on it all over the
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:33.800]   Oh and in case anybody's wondering if you walk by an ATM and it's spitting out
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:41.280]   To keep it no, it's illegal to take it even though you can well you're just cleaning up cover your face
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:47.520]   Cover your face and stroke Sam part of the anti littering campaign ho ho ho I'm collecting cutlets
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:50.160]   Do not look at me
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:53.400]   I am not Leo la part
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.880]   I am not I am are you practicing I'm practicing collecting cutlets
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:03.080]   That was good. Yeah, are you gonna use a ubiki to log into your windows machine?
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:05.240]   so
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:10.960]   I'm confused by this because I already do that and I've been doing that for a long time
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:18.600]   And I'm not sure what year is new well you could do it on a max and Linux apparently, but now there's a ubiki
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:25.160]   But I've been doing it on login for windows. You've always done that I've been doing it with windows 10 for at least two years
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.900]   So I don't know I missed something in there because never mind
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:34.540]   Forget I mentioned but it's important. I mean it's good. You should be using your ubiki login to
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:39.480]   Yeah, or Titan key or whatever it is any kind of two-factor key, okay
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:44.920]   Yeah, I really should instead of keeping an drawer and make your husband do that too. I know
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:47.200]   For reals
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:49.200]   Is your husband insecure?
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:53.800]   No, not at all. No, not at all. Just his nest system. Yeah
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.320]   Or account. Yeah, we don't have to go public with that. That's private
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:01.000]   We don't have to tell the world
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000]   Sorry
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.700]   I already talked about on the material podcast if you'd like to listen the material podcast on the real
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:17.800]   I'm the arena of tech journalism. I gotta make money wherever I can just anticipate the end of her freelance career wants to cash it
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:23.560]   I will do a diaper commercial. I don't care. I will do it. She is she's doing the cutlet on Twitter
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.760]   It's spitting out promos
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:31.480]   Our show today brought to you by legal zoom when we started Twitter
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:35.920]   I was I got went to Kevin Rose who had started a number of companies who was an entrepreneur and I said what do I do?

[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:13.520]   It was really sorry. I really brought down the house. Did you kill her or did she just die?
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:17.000]   Wow a question you
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.400]   Apparently it is
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.200]   We did put her to sleep on Friday at 13
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:26.360]   That's why I was gonna give you sympathy because we had to do that with Aussie yeah, because he was in pain
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:30.240]   Yeah, she was in pain and we wanted a humane thing and I struggled with it
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.840]   But I told us she said the humane thing is the humane thing to do so that's why I'm sorry a 13th on a full moon
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.240]   We did it so you hope to go on their own you don't it's hard
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:44.200]   But everything went to the neighbor next door who has four cats. I was like boy go take it take it all you know
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.200]   We did we paid extra
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:48.520]   We paid extra he said okay
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:56.120]   We can bury the dog. We have a special pet cemetery. Oh, he's gonna throw him a pile over there for an extra $60. We'll bury him
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:02.120]   So I said sure I'd not gonna that would be mean to just throw him in a pile somewhere did they say that?
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:08.840]   In the pile essentially it's they said we you know, oh I got ashes. We're getting an urn made see what I'm saying
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.640]   $300 listen
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.280]   Fluffy was a really
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:21.840]   To put my first dog to sleep a year and a half ago Athena and she's a wonderful dog
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:27.520]   And I loved her very much so are not a chance was I gonna spend $300 on an urn and ashes
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:34.000]   Haven't you people watched big Lebowski? Do you know what happens to ashes? This is a it's a bad scene
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.120]   No, don't scatter. I'm just keep on me keep on the mail
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:43.080]   Thankfully they were they not fault my vase is broke during the earthquake we had recently but the ashes are still intact so
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:49.440]   They should should be intact. I mean they're gonna do ashes a showtime show. I want to see this show
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.920]   About uber the it's called super pump. This is the Mike Isaac
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:58.040]   Yeah, it was the book based on my guys
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:02.320]   Everywhere by the way every airport like bookstores
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.960]   Has it boom?
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:07.280]   So best possible producers there the guys who did billions?
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.920]   The creators and showrunners for billions, which was a great show about very rich people so they're gonna do super pumped
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:20.440]   All about the the Travis Kalanick story. Oh, I want to watch that. I will watch that but I want the Aaron Swerken version
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:26.720]   With a great soundtrack. What's the last thing here? Are they bringing newsroom back? I saw somewhere they're bringing newsroom back
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:32.120]   What's the last thing Aaron did? Was it newsroom? Did he read billions? No? No, no, no, no
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:35.760]   No, I'm just you know, I'm just you know when it comes to Silicon Valley
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:41.080]   Are in sort of gonna such a good, you know, well speaking of Silicon Valley that HBO shows coming back this month, right?
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:45.000]   I know I just canceled me so I didn't I didn't read Isaac's book
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:52.480]   But I took me a moment to think about I read when it came out some Twitter thread about that was basically critiquing it
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:58.320]   And what he what he got wrong and what he missed and it didn't sound like he got anything majorly wrong
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:01.360]   But it did sound like that he missed and again
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:07.240]   I haven't read it but he missed a discussion about how the uber financials have never made sense
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:13.640]   They have a great they don't right but to not include that in the story seems to be like a pretty big oversight
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.440]   He didn't mention that I don't know I haven't read it. Oh, well, I'm but but I
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:23.160]   recall that as being a pretty strong critique of the book was that it either wasn't there
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:28.600]   It wasn't prominent enough given the kind of investment that the company has attracted
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:33.000]   I am sad about this. Maybe I'm the only one they're killing Yahoo groups
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.520]   Everyone who uses Yahoo groups is sad about yeah, the evil boats of four of them
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:40.560]   It's gonna make Google searches a lot easier though
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:46.080]   I'll tell you that because now I won't be getting all these weird like when you're searching for medical advice on the internet and
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:50.840]   Yahoo comes up and it's some like person how is Babbie how is Babbie formed? Yes?
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:54.800]   So you no longer can upload content
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:57.480]   And Yahoo groups will be going away
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:00.440]   Do download your content?
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:03.320]   Because on October 28th
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:07.560]   You can't upload any more content. That's like in a few days and then
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:14.960]   They're gonna disable it. I think what anything to disable it. What will happen to the site? Well, how about a Yahoo?
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:18.440]   What is going on? It's just being stripped of everything
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:23.280]   Yeah, December 14th all previously posted content of the site will be permanently removed
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:28.940]   You and they are not you cannot give them 60 bucks to have a special certificate or anything
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:35.880]   Ashes on your mantle for your guy who grew almost they sanitized tumblr. I mean that was that was the death now
[02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:41.720]   Yeah, then they sold tumblr then that then oh after these after they say after they say after they killed it
[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:43.720]   They lobotomize the bottom eyes and yeah
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:51.120]   Apparently they sold it to automatic the creative WordPress for like nothing like a couple of mill right?
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:55.760]   It was you know the price of of a average house in Los Altos
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:00.500]   I just love watching Verizon just you know screw it all up. That's fine. Hey
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:06.360]   Huawei remember they we banned them and we said they're gonna terrible people they're gonna steal and
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.960]   spy on us and everything turns out they're
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:15.480]   They're sales from January to September grew 25% 86 billion dollars
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:21.960]   Because yeah, it wasn't America though. They lost the American market, but they gained
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:28.680]   Patriots in China who bought a lot of Huawei stuff at Apple's expense oftentimes. Yeah, never
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:34.400]   never underestimate the Chinese patronism because I
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:38.280]   Think you would look very good in this suit
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:43.280]   This is the Virgin Galactic space eyes. I futuristic
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:48.800]   I'm pretty enjoy the modern dance that they're that they're doing in the blue
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:54.680]   Under Armour design flight suits that customers will wear on their short trips to suborbital space
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:01.840]   You want to you want to look you want to look really cool when you're burning up in reentry. It's just suborbital
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:08.280]   They're not going spandex. Yeah, it's 250 thousand dollars. Not really ball. It's very star trekky though
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:13.340]   I think is something the guys I mean they look at they all like even even Richard Branson
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:17.760]   They'll look pretty thin and hair. They look pretty thin and like you know
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:22.040]   What if you get like you know some to like just they're both getting weird space measles?
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:25.360]   I don't know what's going on like Star Trek Enterprise though
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:29.000]   Why not like good Star Trek? Why do they have gold flakes on their forehead?
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:34.360]   Is they go to Sephora to get it because you have to be made of money to get a ticket on this thing?
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:37.640]   That's absolutely no those suits look very expansive
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:40.120]   very expansive
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:42.120]   Meanwhile not expansive
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:49.320]   You know there was the first all-female space walk this week surprisingly I took that long that the that the president
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:55.480]   Screwed up on the call. He said this is the first time women have ever walked in space
[02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:58.420]   Isn't he supposed to be coached on this? I'm sure he had notes
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:03.560]   He's supposed to be coaching a lot of things this you want to know the real sad thing is that we're supposed to be three women
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:06.800]   But they NASA didn't have enough spacesuits the right size
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:11.640]   That's all I can say it's so
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:18.680]   sad to be fair just NASA's needs funding so maybe they just get funding yeah
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:22.040]   Email astronaut who was left behind
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:28.200]   On earth. I did was very gracious about it tweeted at my best friends are walking in space
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:28.800]   This is great
[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:33.380]   Then the president says first time women have ever been outside the capsule and she has to say
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:38.720]   Yeah, actually no, that's not it. What's unique about this is that we're all women here. Oh
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:42.920]   Cobalt turn 60
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:46.080]   That was the worst if you'd done that was a terrible Trump
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:49.640]   American is a medic in
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:55.080]   Cobalt turn 60 I'm running out of things the black hole at
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:59.120]   Fortnite has been closed for two days fortnight goes dark as
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:02.320]   They conclude the chapter
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:07.900]   Chapter 2 is here a whole new fortnight world best marketing ever really good marketing
[02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:12.920]   I'm just I'm laughing cuz lady Gaga tweeted about that. She's like what is for tonight and it was like a huge
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:15.560]   She didn't know what fortnight was no well
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.560]   But she got into a thing with ninja
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:25.160]   She got into a thing with ninja ninja said he would show her before you know how to do fortnight and the people were like
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:27.400]   Why would you do that? I thought you don't play with women me?
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:31.480]   Cuz ninja said he doesn't he doesn't play with women
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:36.600]   No, he's his girlfriend will let him or some Mike Pence what he played with he played with a woman this week
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:42.920]   And the world did not end so does he still have his girlfriend? Yes, he still has his girlfriend - as far as we know
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:46.240]   Hopefully he's growing up a little I'm learning so much
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:52.600]   Never mind. I know I know ask questions, and I realize I don't even want answers
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:55.360]   Don't tell me
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:02.400]   Hey, you know Pewdiepie had like a full page 12 page interview in the New York Times magazine
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:06.440]   Yeah, I was in like windings or something
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:16.120]   No, it was an interesting piece is all I could say I'm sure I think the Times is trying to talk to the young's
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:22.640]   That's not the front page tick-tock article today in the New York Times my case
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:26.960]   Trying to speak to the youth tik-tok. They are creating education
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:32.920]   Like an education suite or something I skimmed so I apologize the Taylor Lorenz if I'm butchering this but
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:38.560]   Apparently the youth is a really using tik-tok to rally each other up in the schools
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:44.880]   Yeah, it's gonna be great. Everybody worry that tik-tok is a wholly owned by yes China. Yes
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:49.160]   Is that an issue? Yes, and our kids are you know
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:51.280]   Love it
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.480]   Yeah, I saw kids in the grocery store the other day. They were using it. It's a digital soma they
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:03.880]   The algorithmic sorting of the videos is so disturbing is it there's no Hong Kong videos. I know that much
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:08.800]   There's a there's a you can't mention when any of the food and know that stuff. I mean it's
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:17.220]   So this is a this is a global so first of all one of the toxic things about all this is only a Chinese social network can be global
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:18.840]   global because
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:25.620]   China doesn't allow well outside Facebook inside but everybody else allows Chinese ones and so the future of social is
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:31.960]   Chinese and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and there's a whole long list of things that not they're not gonna let anybody in the world
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:36.980]   Talk about so they're censoring in the US and elsewhere. The other thing is that the choices. There's there's a
[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:39.000]   somebody on
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000]   notice that like literally
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.000]   99% of the music is black music and
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:51.120]   99% of the people lip-syncing that black means our white kids. This is the way of the world
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:53.720]   It's always been this is the way of tik-tok's algorithm
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.440]   Yeah, and it's like oh, that's interesting and so and so you think it favors white videos
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:03.080]   I think that they are just to completely determining what the content is
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:05.520]   You see all these very scary all kinds of disturbing
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:11.840]   similarities one of the things is a way to manipulate the entire an entire generation
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:18.120]   That's right and just I see a lot of Asians on my tik-tok. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Well. Yeah, it depends on the challenges
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:22.280]   Right, it's whatever the big challenges that's going live like that's what I guess gets
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:30.000]   You're obviously on tik-tok. I'm not on tik-tok. I follow a bunch of Instagram accounts that aggregate tik-tok videos
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:35.480]   So Taylor writes high schools
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:42.360]   Not more I started I read the headline and I stopped I didn't understand it high schools to tik-tok
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:47.840]   We're catching feelings. What I don't is that kid is that's kid speak?
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:51.680]   I think that's a I think that's a new venereal all the feels I mean honestly
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:57.520]   They got a long and should we were catching feels but then they're the New York Times
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.560]   Was not gonna let that fly. Yeah, that pure slide on the wall of a classroom
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:09.040]   This is in Winter Garden, Florida Taylor Lorenz that is home to the West Orange High School tik-tok club
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:16.920]   That's a problem large loopy words are scrawled across a whiteboard wannabe tik-tok famous join tik-tok club
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:21.880]   It's happening it's happening in suburbs across America. It's happening in my own grocery store
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:25.480]   There's a tik-tok club in your grocery store. I don't know okay, so
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:32.280]   Just sorry to backtrack it wasn't me that's how it was my husband my husband saw a bunch of kids making actively making a tik-tok video
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:36.240]   Yeah in the aisles at Rayleys. How is tik-tok different?
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:42.000]   Then vine it's kind of vine right it's a one-minute vine. Yeah
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:45.320]   So we had vine stars vine comics
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:50.800]   Vine lasted a long time and then Twitter bought it and killed it because I kept apparently they couldn't figure out how to make a
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:52.800]   Success out of such a successful product
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:56.160]   tik-tok took over I
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:59.760]   Think tik-tok's the new snapchat. Isn't it? I mean that's what kids are using well
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:03.120]   It's it's not a communications medium. It's a it's more like it's more like vine
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:06.880]   But the algorithmic filtering is so heavy and so
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:14.040]   Well-ming that you just go on to it and it's just it's just sugar for your brain constantly new stuff
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:19.620]   Yeah, and and there is a communication. There's like six second. There's a lot of things like
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:25.520]   Approaches to using it that emerge like these little pranks where they pretend like somebody's wearing a hoodie back
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:30.920]   Well, that's these challenges that you were talking about me that's how they make it more sticky, right?
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:35.000]   You do these regular challenges. Yeah, the riff of the moment
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:42.060]   Yeah, kids today. Yep get off my tik-tok you kids Florence. I on material
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:48.720]   Aa-a all about Android. What's that a third one? I just launched a new podcast

[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:43.460]   I am actually bringing back a podcast Mike Elgin radio. I had two both on hiatus. It's not real yet
[02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:47.460]   It's I'm in formation of it, but it's gonna be very very
[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:50.500]   hyper authentic and
[02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:54.180]   It's gonna be about my life. I'm you know talking to various people
[02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:56.980]   I'm gonna bring people into the calls that I have with people in the industry
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:02.180]   When I can and and so on so it's gonna be it's gonna be just a fun thing and
[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:08.220]   Looking forward to doing that there you go go to algin calm for all of that and it's coming back
[02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:14.100]   Yeah, yeah, so you last time I was on to it. You said you didn't see the pictures that I took with the
[02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:18.900]   Pixel 3 feature that yeah smile so you've posted those now
[02:17:18.900 --> 02:17:24.180]   So I posted it on this one so you could see them oh they were on and this Seth was here when we did this last time
[02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:28.020]   No, I don't now. Let's see you and me
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:33.060]   Yeah, this apparently was some drinking involved, but I there was heavily heavy drinking
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:38.540]   But when anybody smiles this was the and by the way Google killed the clip which was their little photo thing
[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:43.780]   Yep, but this is the smile feature on the phone on gastronormat experiences. I use this feature heavily
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:46.500]   I just I have a I have like one of those grill spots fun
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:51.100]   I put up the phone and it's like at the end of the day. I have like a bazillion photos of
[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:54.900]   Robie's it only that looks like it's only taking a picture when both of us are smiling
[02:17:54.900 --> 02:18:01.340]   It's fake. I think it does favor it when both smile. Yes, but this isn't all of my it actually took like 300
[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:06.740]   Yeah, and I kind of cherry picked we smile a lot of nice ones and built this collage, but that's how to elk it
[02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:08.740]   I like that. Yeah, great
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:10.740]   Seth yep
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.740]   It's not my fault
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:15.060]   editor-in-chief the parallax.com
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:15.560]   G
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:21.860]   Dash parallax.com great security blog. He's you doing a podcast - you know
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:26.900]   More I show up here the more I think I really should really something that anybody could do better
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:30.340]   Maybe maybe like you know hackers and cars with coffee
[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:35.700]   Actually really like that. It's a great idea. That's a great idea because on motorcycles with make it know
[02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:38.340]   I don't want the have you seen these guys? They're huge they'll
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:40.980]   The way to the bike
[02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:43.540]   With me
[02:18:43.540 --> 02:18:50.100]   Maybe if maybe if I got like a side car I could get like I could get Russia to sponsor like a URL
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:55.180]   Right they have side cars and then Russia to sponsor it. That's oh was that out loud
[02:18:55.180 --> 02:19:00.100]   You know I'll say you're gonna run some walls there at this point
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:05.940]   I you know Russia wants to buy ads on Twitter. I'm all in I can yandex yandex baby
[02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:08.180]   I don't think Harley will get me a URL though. No
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.940]   You could have a local
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:16.060]   Contingent you know electric I could have like a Harley electric, but they don't they stop selling them
[02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:21.980]   I don't know if you what they did. Yeah, why too powerful for America to screwy to work
[02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:28.140]   What yeah, they've made a big deal about their Harley and the live wire or something. Yeah, yeah, they stopped
[02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:30.140]   They just started they put him on hiatus. I
[02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:36.340]   Bet you I bet you did I've mentioned that earlier. Yeah, so much torque right with an electric motor
[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:41.060]   Oh sure. I bet you it was really hard to drive like it would people would know well, you know this year
[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:46.700]   The the zero was out there they do they do fine and it actually run into some folks in the city not physically
[02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:48.220]   But I've met them
[02:19:48.220 --> 02:19:52.500]   Who who have zeros and they love them because they get home they plug them in at night
[02:19:52.500 --> 02:19:58.860]   They always have a nice charge. They're great for city commutes. You don't want them, you know longer than that
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:04.340]   But so you're saying that this web page which says the future has arrived and its electric should be written and then it just left
[02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:09.700]   Yeah, it's alright. It's gone the future is gonna the future was here and it's taking a moment and
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:16.820]   You know checking in it does look like way too powerful for any, you know, oh, I like the bikes though
[02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:18.620]   I'll buy a bicycle
[02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:21.680]   Like these are for kids. That's why I like it. I don't know
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:28.540]   Do you think that I see so many people with e-bikes and scooters now? I'm an e-bike guy. I love them. Yeah, yeah
[02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:34.100]   But that's that's all that we need to say. Thank you for being here. Thank you Mike
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:36.780]   Enjoy your travels flow. Thank you Leo
[02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:44.540]   Congratulations. Thank you. That's wonderful news. I'm talking about our new podcast. Thank you all for joining us
[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:48.260]   We do this week in tech every Sunday and even when I'm gone
[02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:53.440]   We're still gonna do it every Sunday 230 Pacific 530 Eastern 2130 UTC
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:57.620]   If you want to join us live in the studio just email tickets at twit.tv
[02:20:57.620 --> 02:21:01.380]   From Limerick Ireland. We have a visitor
[02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:07.460]   Everybody in Ireland sounds like the leprechaun from Lucky Charms not really
[02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:12.580]   Kelly nice to have you can I appreciate it works at Juniper
[02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:17.460]   If you want to be here just email tickets at twit.tv. We'll be glad they get a chair out for you
[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:21.940]   You can also watch the live stream live audio and video at
[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:26.980]   Twit.tv/live if you're doing that the chat room is a great place to hang because they're doing the same thing
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:34.020]   IRC.twit.tv we also have a very nice forum you're in it flow Mike's in it
[02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:40.100]   Seth I invite you to join us the Twit community at www.twit.community
[02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:44.900]   And it's been a lot of fun. It's quit Facebook and join the Twit community
[02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:52.540]   You know what it's my new theory is that hyper local communities hyper local social networks will replace the global social networks
[02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:57.660]   The dumpster fires that are Twitter and Facebook because it's people with shared
[02:21:57.660 --> 02:22:02.740]   Commonality and we all feel a little bit of an ownership. So it's cleaner. It's a nicer place to be
[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:06.500]   Yes, it's like a garden where everybody's in charge. I think it's a much better place
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:11.860]   I did that with discord. It's working out real well. Yeah, you have a discord for myself my work. Just you yeah
[02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:15.100]   Like that flow discord. Oh nice
[02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:19.940]   Right on that's your own little social network. Yeah. Can anybody join it? Yeah, what's the server?
[02:22:19.940 --> 02:22:25.060]   Uh you have to find the link it's there's a link on my website. Good luck. That's how you get in good luck
[02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:28.380]   That's a great idea try to make it, you know, that's a great idea
[02:22:28.380 --> 02:22:34.420]   Anyway, twit. community is our community. We also make podcasts believe it or not this show
[02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:37.300]   Will then be turned into an on-demand show
