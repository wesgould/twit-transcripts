[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, the Chopin Piano Sonata number two.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.120]   In B major, this is in honor of H.D.D.D.D.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.760]   which kicked the bucket this week.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.960]   Dead as a doornail.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.440]   It was just, it was kind of like a dominoes.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.800]   Starts with Warner Brothers pulling the plug.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.480]   Then Walmart pulls the plug.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.640]   Then Netflix pulls the plug.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.000]   I love this music.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.360]   They can't hear it.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.440]   They play it through the ladder.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.640]   Then Best Buy pulls the plug.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.440]   And then the final death blow, Toshiba itself kills H.D.D.D.D.D.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.160]   Is it over?
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.560]   It's over now.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.440]   No, no, no, no, no, no, the analysis begins.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.120]   I have a column running at Tomorrow's PC magazine where I assert
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.520]   that there was never sincere to begin with.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.560]   It was just all a scheme by Microsoft to screw over Sony
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.720]   any way it could to get market share for the Xbox.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.640]   And some have posited it because if there were a conflict
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.320]   between the two H.D. formats that downloads,
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.840]   H.D. downloads would prove preeminent.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.480]   And that's a first Microsoft, right?
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.760]   I think the days of Microsoft being able to orchestrate
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.920]   that level of conspiracy are along behind this.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.640]   People give Microsoft--
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.480]   It's not a conspiracy.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.800]   It's a marketing--
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.960]   I mean, it's like saying they can't advertise.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.000]   It was just a marketing ploy.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.520]   I don't think it was much of a conspiracy
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.960]   because there was no real conspirators.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.400]   Who was it?
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.360]   It was Microsoft and Toshiba were those the two big players.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.720]   About it.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.520]   Pretty much.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.600]   Pretty much.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.160]   Honestly, I really-- I think Microsoft is sad to say that
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.040]   kind of ineptile.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.160]   I mean, their last big marketing attempt
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.320]   was Vista capable.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.120]   So why did all these people pull the plug on H.D.V.D?
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.480]   Was there something wrong with it?
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.320]   Oh, it's money.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.280]   It's a matter of money.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.520]   I mean, if Sony's willing to drop millions and millions
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.200]   of dollars on movie studios and Toshiba
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.120]   is only willing to drop half million dollars
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.600]   or whatever the case may be or just a tad less than Sony,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.240]   if I'm Warner Brothers, why would I
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.360]   want to go with the guy who's paying me less?
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.440]   I mean, it's pretty simple.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.400]   It's simply economics as far as I'm concerned.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.840]   I think--
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.680]   Yeah, I'm not the free market kind either,
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.760]   the backroom deal kind.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.520]   Well, I don't know.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.360]   I mean, I think maybe the PS3 had something to do with this.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.600]   Nobody had sold as many players as Sony did with this Blu-ray
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   power.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.800]   I think it's-- I don't think that at all.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.920]   I mean, I think the PS3 has been--
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.840]   1 million players.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.140]   Yeah, but so far it's an unbridled
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.640]   failure.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.080]   I mean, there's no games for it.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.040]   People have been saying that it's kind of a joke.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.840]   Sony was the head of the video game industry for a long time.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.080]   Now, of some, it's the loser.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.720]   But wait a minute.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.480]   It's an unbridled failure as a gaming platform.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.000]   Nevertheless, there's sold far more Blu-ray players as PS3s
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.080]   than HD DVD sold at any form factor.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.480]   Yeah, but there was a big study that
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.400]   said that some maybe upwards of 60% of PS3 owners did not even
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.520]   know that they had a Blu-ray player.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Not that Blu-ray player is pretty bad on it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.080]   Yeah, I mean, it's just people don't use that.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.980]   I actually had an opportunity.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.700]   I was talking to you as off the air when I was talking to him.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.300]   I had talked to a Sony gaming exec the other day.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.860]   And he sort of echoed that.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.020]   I mean, they're trying as hard as they can to get the Blu-ray
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.380]   into the home through the PS3.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.900]   But it's really not working.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.420]   And people want a gaming platform.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.340]   And they don't really care about anything else.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.020]   The most interesting--
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.100]   P&D sucks is a gaming platform.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.300]   But that's going to change this year when some games finally
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.900]   come out.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.940]   I disagree with you.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.460]   It's a very good Blu-ray player.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.980]   And it's one of the few that's--
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.780]   Yeah, it's one of the few that's upgradable because it's
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.680]   kind of really like it.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.440]   I mean, actually, I'm using Panasonic right now.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.400]   Well, I just--
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.640]   I don't like the functionality of it.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.040]   I like my Panasonic slightly better.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   It's a little weird having to use a game place joystick
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.960]   to change movies and to flip fast forward and stuff.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.880]   That is a little weird.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.360]   I suppose I could buy a third party.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   Yeah, I mean, you could get this.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.480]   There's probably a hack for it, right?
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.400]   There's a hack to do it with the Xbox.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.080]   I'm sure there's a--
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.580]   I'm sure there's a--
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.840]   I'm sure there's some of the next remote control.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.120]   I'm sure somebody makes it remote control.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.520]   But it's just weird because I'm using the game controller.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.720]   It's kind of strange.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   Yes.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.620]   All right.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.820]   Anyway, let me introduce all these crappy people.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.060]   John just threw away his notes.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.020]   He's going off notes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.660]   You're not going to do the stump speech, John?
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.860]   I think it's funny that you monitor these little levels
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.780]   so much that you can tell who's doing that.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.740]   I know those are pretty loud throw away the notes.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.700]   John's seem to--
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.420]   He's got to be looking at the--
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.920]   I am.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.580]   I know who's talking.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.060]   Meters.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.820]   I know.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.500]   I'm playing attention.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.980]   Hey, you know, this moderation thing is hard work.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.360]   People dismiss it.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.960]   JohnC.devorect.org/blog, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.360]   It's the place to go for salacious sex tidbits
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.920]   with occasional technology thrown in.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.340]   He also is the host of a number of podcasts, Cranky Geeks,
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.040]   which I'm going to be on on Wednesday.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.120]   In fact, are we going to have Adam Curry?
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.320]   Are you working on that?
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.600]   Yeah, I think that would be funny.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.680]   It'd be like I could collectible to have you and Adam Curry
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.480]   in the same crankcase.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.520]   Yeah, I'm curry.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.280]   Excellent.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.240]   Yeah, I'll grow my hair out just for that.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.180]   I'm maybe I'll wear him, all right?
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.400]   Now you're talking.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.020]   He's also does a daily tech news thing called Tech Fives,
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.940]   which is a direct competition to buzz out loud.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.980]   Molly Wood is here.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.960]   How do you feel about that, Molly?
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.460]   Look out.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.460]   I'm not--
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.960]   They don't say that.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   They chat up to news.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.260]   I just run through it.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.420]   There's a big difference.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.300]   I like the chat.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.220]   There is no competition to buzz out loud.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.720]   Listen to John to find out what the news is.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.500]   Listen to Molly and Tom to find out.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.600]   To chat it up, I guess.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.620]   I don't know.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.260]   Molly, by the way, is a very good writer.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.100]   I don't know.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.860]   When you read the Twitter novel that we're doing,
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.700]   140 novel, you could tell where Molly's stuff is,
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.700]   because it's the only stuff that's well written.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.940]   Oh, stop.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.940]   No, that's going to--
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.440]   I don't know.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.740]   You've introduced this Barbara plot line that I'm very
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.140]   excited about.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.980]   I have no idea, but you made it happen.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.540]   You made Barbara.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.860]   Now we have a female lead.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.500]   Yeah, I knew we had to get a female in there.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.300]   So you should have given me involved in this scene,
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.660]   because every time I would throw in a go like this.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.020]   And then I woke up.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.460]   That's exactly why you're not playing our game.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.340]   You made the argument very well for us.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.260]   Molly Wood is the host of BuzzatlabboL.cnet.com.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.780]   You also see her on cnettv.com.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.940]   Speaking of Cnet Don Reisinger is also here.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.420]   And he's got a real URL.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.940]   Oh, I do.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.620]   It's about time.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.100]   Digital Home.cnet.com.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.620]   Digital Home.cnet.com.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.140]   I'm going to talk a little bit about Digital in a bit,
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.620]   because you know, one year from today--
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.900]   there's two digital stories.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.900]   One year from today, digital TV, analogs phased out.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.820]   And this week, analog cell phones are phased out.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.500]   So those of you who still using analog cell phones--
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   John, I believe you are.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   I have one.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.380]   You're going to have to stop using it.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:30.780]   I know.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.860]   They keep calling me about it.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.380]   Now the thing is that bothers me, is that analog,
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.300]   even though this is like just one of those burners that
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.980]   happens to go through an analog system.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.900]   I remember back in the day when they switched over
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.300]   from analog to digitally, used digital as a big promotional
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.460]   tool, that the quality just deteriorated like overnight
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.540]   and analog has always been better.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.020]   People hated it when they went to digital,
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.660]   because analog would degrade gracefully.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.020]   Digital just drops off.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.180]   Well, isn't there-- the worst thing about this, right,
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.180]   is if you use OnStar.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.460]   Was it analog?
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.340]   Yeah, I think it's going to affect older OnStar vehicles.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.700]   They won't work anymore.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.820]   OnStar?
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.340]   OnStar, I'm hanging upside down by my seat belt.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.540]   Water's coming in the car.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.380]   OnStar?
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.460]   No, it's going to help you, my friend.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.940]   Hello!
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.300]   I can't unlock the door.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.780]   It's your analog.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:23.020]   That's Jason Calicanis, the man behind Mahalo, M-A-H-A-L-O.com,
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.660]   the human-powered search engine, and also the guy who
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.500]   pays Veronica to do those great daily video podcasts.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.740]   Also known as the Yoko Ono of Buzz out loud.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.220]   Sorry.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:33.740]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.380]   You're the Yoko Ono?
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.460]   You broke up the band?
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.460]   I guess that's--
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.820]   How can this is Yoko?
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.460]   Did Jason come in and sit during the recording sessions
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.300]   and just kind of give Tom the stink eye?
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.140]   No, but he's got that same screechy voice
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.940]   if you actually listen to him.
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.620]   Jason, I actually was on--
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.540]   I think one of the first episodes of Buzz out loud
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.380]   when Veronica went on air.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.540]   Because she used to be--
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:08:59.540]   Oh.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.820]   I guess people don't know that she was the engineer.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.540]   Right.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.380]   Correct, Molly?
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.580]   Yeah, she was the Jason Howell.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.540]   The audio engineer, the audio producer.
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.460]   And what happened in the time I was on the show?
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.940]   She was--
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.820]   Nothing.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.340]   Veronica has found her--
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.260]   Veronica has found her true calling as--
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.260]   [YELLING]
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.500]   --video pallet.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.540]   Because that one time and that one time only
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.620]   that Jason was on the show, we lost the entire episode
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.700]   and had to rerecord it.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.740]   What?
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.940]   It was a hard big show.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.940]   So then I started in the middle of the show going,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.580]   you know, I think you need a new engineer.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.540]   This is Veronica.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.580]   I don't know who this is, but I don't have a lot of time.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.900]   I'm a very important person.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.900]   You can't waste my time.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.700]   So what I was obviously putting on an act.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.860]   And so she got on the air.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.300]   I don't know.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.980]   We got to find the URL for that, but it was pretty funny.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.460]   She was like, shut up, Jason.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.700]   Is that still around?
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.700]   What is it?
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.580]   I don't know what episode it is, but I'm sure it's still around.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.060]   And it should be under--
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.620]   Odeo is, I think, the best way to find the archives.
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.340]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.220]   That's sad.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.780]   And that's true.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.700]   That's sad.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.020]   Well, no, you can find them all now at vol.cena.com.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.220]   It's a lot easier than it used to be,
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.660]   but it's harder to search.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.980]   Is Odeo even doing it?
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.100]   I mean, they sold it, right?
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.020]   All Odeo is to me as a little search engine for back
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.020]   episodes.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.460]   I'm trying to--
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.980]   But it's a little search engine that could
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.700]   for back episodes of Buzz out loud.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.740]   I'm trying to find that old episode.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.700]   If I find it, I'll play it.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.780]   Well, introduce the old dog on the corner.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.700]   We like to see that our computer is just--
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.700]   I'm just on digitalhome.cena.com.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.420]   All right, I'm sure you've been, Jon.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.620]   I'm not paying any attention.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.780]   Pay attention to black.com/fondorblackplug.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.180]   I'm actually on a website right now.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.460]   I'm actually on a website right now.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.860]   I'm actually looking at the mullets as we speak.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.700]   I was going to--
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.540]   Is there a--
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.060]   Ooh, have you been to that site?
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.780]   Mullets galore.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.820]   Have you been to mullets galore?
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.420]   Now I'm going to seem like a mullet expert on top of this.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:42.940]   But--
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.580]   Everybody go to mullets galore.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.500]   A joint that says join the mulletcha, the mullet--
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.020]   It's outstanding.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.380]   They have a picture of you on there, Molly.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.180]   They can take photos of mullets in action.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.820]   Here's Donald Trump's mullet.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.060]   That's attractive.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.180]   I like the guy at Toolworld, appropriately enough.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.180]   You know--
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.700]   Now, come on looking at this.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.780]   How can you even say--
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.380]   That's not Mollywood.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.940]   Come on.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.780]   Come on.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.780]   Don D'Morac.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.780]   All right, here we go.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.780]   Well, I'll have to--
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.780]   I'll have to re-assess.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.780]   Thanks to Chapman.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.780]   Thank you.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.780]   It is audio, audio, 306369.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.780]   The special visit from Jason Calicanis.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.780]   I'm Mollywood, author of "Tinets"--
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.780]   October 13, 2005.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.780]   "Tinets" the real deal.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.780]   Welcome to Buzz Out Loud, the podcast of "Indeterminals."
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.780]   I'm going to-- you still sound exactly the same, by the way.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.780]   I have to jump ahead to-- where is Jason given on my hard time?
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.780]   It's right in the middle, you think?
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.780]   Yeah, it's somewhere in the middle.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.780]   You're going to have to--
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.340]   I think right off the bat, he probably starts bitching about how
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.340]   you--
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.340]   Buying a piece of--
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.780]   I'm telling you, though, I'm cast her in discussion.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.780]   I like that.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.780]   I would make them.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.780]   I would be able to get this as well.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.780]   What happens to the--
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.780]   Hey, you know--
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.780]   He's on the phone.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.780]   I don't even want to hear it.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.780]   You're on the phone.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.780]   Get some production in there.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.940]   Make him's coming to the studio-- oh, wait a minute.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.020]   You guys are all on Skype.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.580]   Never mind.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.980]   So let's see.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.780]   HD DVD is dead.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.780]   The analog is dead in the cell phone industry.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.940]   And in one year, we're all going to have to get digital TVs.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.540]   Do you think Americans even understand what that means?
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.220]   I think even the cable companies now are thinking they're putting
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.060]   out ads saying, that's not us.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.060]   Don't worry.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.660]   Well, on the one hand, they're putting out ads saying, that's not
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.660]   us.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.660]   But on the other hand, they're going door to door telling people
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.660]   that they're going to have to subscribe to Digital Cable.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.180]   Good point.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.940]   That's the way around it, isn't it?
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.940]   Mm-hmm.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.700]   You have to get our most expensive digital cable package.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.340]   Otherwise, your TV isn't going to work.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.340]   Oh, my God.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.740]   They're not really doing that, are they?
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.940]   We've gotten reports of Comcast doing that.
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.820]   Like people have written into Buzzette Loud and said,
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.180]   a Comcast agent came to my door and told me this,
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.860]   gave me this song in dance.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.580]   Has anyone got us something in writing
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.460]   that they can document this with?
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.100]   Well, we got an email.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.780]   Does that count?
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.780]   No.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.380]   Well, see, that's probably smart enough not to print this stuff up,
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:12:59.860]   John.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.340]   Yeah, I mean, this is how they do it.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.700]   I mean, I remember when I bought Verizon insurance
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.180]   from Assurion and they were like, oh, we'll replace your phone
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.060]   under any circumstances.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.420]   So then my phone breaks.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.260]   And they're like, oh, yeah, but we don't handle software
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.860]   or bios problems, and the person who was in the store
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.540]   absolutely lied to me about what the phone insurance was.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.260]   And I didn't read the eight page in terms of service.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.380]   But I think that's how they do it.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.620]   They get low-level salespeople.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.740]   They give them spiffs.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.140]   So you give them like 50 bucks for selling it.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.540]   They do it by any means necessary.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.820]   They're college kids or whatever.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.660]   There's no ramification for them.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.420]   They lose the job.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.380]   You're doing them a favor.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.780]   And then you got plausible deniability up at the top.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.060]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.340]   It was just like, oh, this rogue kid, rogue trader.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.180]   That's actually what Blackberry, what RIM is doing.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.900]   They're blaming the techies for the outage.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.220]   This is their second outage in a year.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.820]   Earlier this week, Blackberry is down all over North America.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.220]   What is it?
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.220]   How would they have 11 million subscribers completely
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.380]   blacked out?
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.820]   And they're saying, oh, you're just--
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.260]   it was the geek's did it.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.180]   Yeah, that's always good.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.780]   Throw your tech team under the bus, the geek's did it.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.220]   Yeah, because they don't have any recourse, right?
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.660]   They're powerless.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.540]   They have any good ideas about--
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.060]   They're going to be like--
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.020]   mess things up.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.700]   I wonder what happens with--
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.700]   I'm sure when the PR, the PR guys credit rating
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.980]   goes to something ridiculous.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.820]   Or they're like going to be leaking emails from the CEO.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.540]   Or looking at the CEO is like log files on their browser
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.700]   and sending them anonymously to somebody.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.180]   I mean--
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.140]   I love all the salaries will be revealed.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.020]   I love the full page ads that Paul has been buying
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.220]   in the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers saying,
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.460]   they didn't mention Blackberry, but saying,
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.620]   our network is pretty reliable.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.620]   Our network.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.380]   Yeah, except the phones thing.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.260]   Except all the phones except for the central is pretty bad.
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.380]   So I pretty much have to laugh at Palm at this point.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.460]   Do they have a network going bad to worse?
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.580]   What is their net-- I don't understand.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.940]   Do they do Blackberry style stuff?
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.540]   I don't know.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.380]   I have a trio.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.620]   I've never heard of it.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.340]   That's why it doesn't go down.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.340]   Yeah, nobody uses it.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.460]   They support GoodLink so they use the Good network
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.860]   to interface with Exchange on the phone.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.700]   That's what you use.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.700]   That's what you use.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.260]   That's what I use.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.780]   And then they have Windows Mobile running on Palm devices,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.300]   too.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.700]   So then they do Exchange that way.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.540]   Are you running on Palm device?
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.340]   Yeah, I have a trio.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.780]   755p.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.220]   And how have you liked the GoodLink?
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.420]   Has it been up?
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.380]   GoodLink is a big fat joke.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.060]   Well, the big-- actually, GoodLink is OK.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.180]   The problem is it's basically a hack.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.460]   Like it's not native Exchange.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.980]   I mean, you may have a hellish experience
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.180]   running with those mobile because it's terrible mobile operating
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.540]   system, but at least Exchange is native.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.540]   Whereas GoodLink is a weird hack that if you've got--
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.820]   I have terrible service at my house from Sprint
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.820]   because I'm in Hills.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.940]   Oh, no.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.380]   And so the GoodLink is just a nightmare.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.460]   It has to be connected online to be composing an email.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.580]   So if my service goes out, which it constantly does,
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.340]   and my phone has to reconnect to power, vision, blah, blah,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.700]   then the whole thing locks up.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.300]   And just a mid email.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.820]   And this happens like three times in the course
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.460]   of a paragraph-long email.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.900]   And then I just lose my mind.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.260]   Now wait, because there'll be a full page
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.260]   out in the journal on Monday.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.980]   Molly Wood of CNET says--
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.340]   There is no better email service than Blackberry.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.020]   And if it goes down once in a while, actually,
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.820]   it's probably good for the people who have them
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.460]   because they learn that they can survive without their Blackberry
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.740]   for 60 minutes.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.500]   Or that they're completely dependent on it.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.820]   There's more divorces based on properties than anything.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.220]   Oh, my kids hate it when they pull out my Blackberry.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.740]   They say, no, Daddy, no, please don't leave us.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.220]   I honestly, I think that these glitches are not--
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.700]   service occasionally going down is to be expected.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.140]   The problem is that Blackberry bifs it so spectacularly
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.420]   every time it happens.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.500]   They blame-- the first, they don't say anything for days
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:41.820]   on it.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.380]   And then they blame the geeks in this really arcane language
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.580]   that everybody's like, just tell me that you broke it
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.420]   and give me a little credit.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.300]   Done.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.260]   Just put a picture of a kitten with a screwdriver.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.500]   And you're done, man.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.140]   I am in your hairstyle.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.020]   Breaking your kitchen.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.060]   Oh, I very love that.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.420]   I tried it so cute. I forgive you.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.460]   Yeah, everybody is very familiar with the Twitter
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.780]   is down pictures.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.380]   They just love that.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.740]   I hate that little bird.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.380]   I'm saying a lot of the worst services I ever use,
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.180]   but I can't get off it.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.180]   It's just an awful disgusting--
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.860]   You know, it was another tremendous failure
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.020]   at keeping their servers up, eBay.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.260]   If you can't share-- yeah, remember in the early days of eBay,
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.740]   they almost lost-- they almost screwed up their IPO
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.100]   and everything.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.900]   They went down for like two days.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.020]   And their fans were so rabid that they
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.700]   were, you know, A, causing the outage, which is what happens
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.540]   with Twitter.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.540]   And then B, they loved it so much.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.380]   They were like, oh, we forgive you.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.380]   It actually is a good marketing technique.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.060]   So it's interesting--
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.820]   Well, you used to be eBay.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.180]   Good.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.540]   Good.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.220]   I know I know.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.500]   You're going to talk about the eBay boycott.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.900]   Starts Monday.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.460]   No, I just-- I was going to say something
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.020]   about different about eBay, just the fact
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.420]   that it's become such a joke lately.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.260]   I mean, they can't run a business anymore.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.260]   The site's got awful ugly.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.780]   I don't understand what's going on.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.620]   Now, everything there, don't you go there first
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.100]   when you want to find something?
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.540]   No.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.060]   I do.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.420]   I don't know.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.420]   I mean--
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.700]   My accident.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.060]   Yeah, I mean, I go to Amazon.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.860]   Amazon's always one of my first steps.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.020]   If I wanted a copy of Windows 98SC,
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.540]   the first place that goes eBay.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.100]   Yeah, but, you know, I mean, how long will it be until eBay
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.060]   finally realizes that it's not so invincible the way it used
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.380]   to be.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.940]   It's not where we're going to go.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.780]   There was an exact one to point out here.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:25.460]   There was an example of Leo throwing Don a softball
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.660]   that Don didn't pay attention to Don.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.660]   You've got to bring your game up.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.100]   I didn't hear what he said.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.500]   What was the softball?
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.300]   I mean, John picks up these things right away.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.860]   But, you know, John, you've been working with me for 15 years.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.300]   You know.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.420]   John's a seasoned veteran.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.380]   He's a seasoned veteran.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.180]   You're the callow rookie.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.900]   Yeah, I'm the new guy in the ball.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.900]   The new guy in the ball.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.060]   He's not callow?
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.540]   I haven't--
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.020]   He's callow.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:47.660]   It's me.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.220]   Oh, you're callow.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.380]   Well, what is the word they use with the rookies?
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.700]   Unseasoned.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.220]   Green.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:54.700]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.700]   Seasoned.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.900]   Is that Unseasoned?
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.700]   Like my break.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.540]   eBay announced--
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.260]   Risinger is a raw steak.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.420]   He's making an answer.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.060]   Print that.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.260]   Copy.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.100]   eBay announced a certain--
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.780]   fee increases January 12th.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.140]   The big sellers are saying there's
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.180]   going to be a week-long boycott beginning Monday, February 18.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.380]   A lot of sellers are angry.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.100]   There are pages around this.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:24.660]   Powersellersunite.com and nolistingday.com.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.820]   Do you think this is just a tapest in a teapot?
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.540]   Or are these guys really going to do some damage?
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.660]   I think that companies are going to do enough damage to itself.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.020]   It's laughable.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.420]   The watch had tried to run itself.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.820]   Now, Matt Whitman says she wants to leave.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.660]   I didn't see it.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.260]   I just don't think I really care.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.100]   I thought she already announced that she was leaving.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.260]   Yeah, I was leaving.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:45.780]   Sleep to you.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.020]   Well, that's what I said.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.380]   What did I say?
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:48.900]   She wants to--
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.740]   What you mean, it sounded like she was actively thinking about it.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.660]   No, no.
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.020]   She's leaving.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.340]   I thought it was the new boss that announced all these new.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:57.820]   All right.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.340]   All right.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.500]   Meg Whitman's leaving.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.020]   Wentz.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.620]   It's still a pretty incredible business.
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.140]   I mean, they did over $7 billion last year,
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.780]   and they have a huge margin, and they have 95% of auctions.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.260]   I think the problem is they're so successful in what they do,
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.740]   they can't find a second act, and they were hoping Skype would
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.620]   be that second act.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.140]   That was it.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.100]   They basically make 99% of their money from PayPal and eBay.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.860]   And eBay, as an auction site, is so dominant,
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.220]   there's no growth left.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.540]   So all they can do is raise the fees,
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.540]   and this is what happens when you raise fees.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.660]   It's not going to impact their business in any way,
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.860]   except all those users will come back.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.540]   That's just--
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.300]   Yeah, I think you make a good point about--
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.820]   --what they just said was something that's interesting,
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.900]   because you say eBay was a great auction site.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.900]   But in a lot of ways, eBay has stopped being an auction site.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.540]   I mean, you have pay it there, buy it now everywhere you look.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.020]   And they have Skype and everything else.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.180]   I mean, where's the-- if this is an auction site,
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.340]   it should be an auction site.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:50.980]   It's as simple as that.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.940]   It's really awesome.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.300]   Who's the next-- I mean, is auction?
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.820]   I don't agree with that.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.740]   I totally agree with that.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.660]   It's bull.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.980]   You look up anything on there, always buy it now, buy it now,
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.420]   buy it now.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.620]   Let me just add one more thing.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.700]   Wait, the existence of the button fundamentally
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.220]   corrupts the entire ethos of the site?
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.140]   No, it's when you go to a page and everything
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.140]   on that entire page because something you're looking at
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.060]   as a buy it now.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.180]   These are all retailers.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.300]   This is not an auction.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.940]   It's a bit, right?
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.420]   Don't people still fit?
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.020]   Yeah, I bet.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.260]   Buy it now, is it mandatory?
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.380]   Just because the button's there.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.420]   My kid buys it.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.260]   Let's face it, it's a scam.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.500]   How many times you go to Christie's when they say, oh, yeah,
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.660]   buy it now, or you can buy it right now before you--
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.620]   That doesn't happen.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.060]   We could have an on list now, but if you'd
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.300]   like to buy this fine painting--
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.740]   Well, they just say, you know, the ad that feels
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.980]   to a broader audience, though.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.980]   I am not interested in auctioning.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.980]   I almost never go to eBay because I don't like to buy old stuff.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.340]   But if I do go, then I just want it to be over with
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.140]   because I am a retail shopper.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.620]   So for me, buy it now is like something that would bring me
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.220]   to eBay when I might otherwise never go.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.660]   New Spain's audience.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.660]   With that--
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.460]   Yeah, I think that's because your audience--
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.660]   You can't complain about them not having growth.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.260]   And then be against the buy it now.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.340]   They edit buy it now so they could
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.860]   sort of encroach upon the bottom 10%, 20% of Amazon's business.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.660]   But it's not working.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.740]   And there's less listings now.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.580]   So what's going on?
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.220]   I mean, there's not--
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.020]   Are there other fewer listings than anything?
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.620]   Yeah, I mean, that's the whole part of it,
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.900]   that they're dropping the rates because they said that we
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.740]   have fewer listings, we need to jumpstart listings.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.500]   That was my understanding.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.620]   So--
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.900]   That's right.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.580]   Well, let me mention something here, which is the second act.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.980]   They had in the late '90s and before the collapse,
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.580]   they were thinking about some stuff that was--
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.580]   I thought was pretty aggressive.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.980]   They had bought Butterfield and Butterfield in San Francisco,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.980]   which is a big auction house.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.700]   And I thought they were going to go legit.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.340]   And they could have, with their momentum,
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.140]   maybe taken over all the business, which
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.660]   is Sotheby's and Christie's and Butterfield
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.180]   and a bunch of other ones.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.460]   But they just got into the real business of auctions.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.140]   It's, I don't know.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.420]   We didn't care much for this business.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.740]   So they dumped it.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.580]   And it was just like--
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.180]   And then they just kind of been backsliding ever since.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.140]   I think they've lost their aggression.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.620]   Is the message here that it's really easy to jump the shark
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.460]   in the tech industry?
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.660]   I mean, I think of a lot of companies
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.860]   that, on paper like eBay, are prospering.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.340]   Microsoft might be another example.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.700]   And about to just fall off the edge of the earth.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.540]   I think the message is that in the blogosphere,
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.180]   you have not one--
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.100]   between the blogosphere and your friggin' aggressive shareholders,
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.500]   you don't have an inch of wig over them.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.780]   There is no margin of error.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.420]   Like, you know what their reduction in active listings
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:15.940]   was?
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.500]   2% in the first quarter of 2007.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.340]   That is probably a large number of listings.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.860]   But it's also one quarter's results, and it's 2%.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.620]   Like, and here's Don, declared him dead.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.740]   Good for you, Don.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.700]   The issue is--
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.220]   The issue is--
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.740]   I hope he has to.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.540]   The issue we're having is when you go from a high growth
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.500]   business to a mature business, the people who
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.500]   invest in your company change.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.100]   And that's what they're feeling right now is that pain.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.660]   And that's the same pain Yahoo went through.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.020]   And at some point, it's the pain Google will go through.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.460]   And that's why they're changing management as well,
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.940]   is because you're saying there's no fire in the belly.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.500]   Really, the big thing that eBay could do
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.220]   is classifies, which they're going after.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.060]   They have a site that's been growing.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.180]   And they also, in 25% of Craigslist, search.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.860]   And they will launch a search engine.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.660]   I guarantee it.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.180]   They are one of the largest advertisers on Google.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.980]   And they've had many debates and back and forth with Google
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.100]   about including their auctions in the organic results.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.780]   They bought StumbleUpon.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.940]   StumbleUpon is a search engine in disguise.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.260]   If in another year or two, StumbleUpon
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.660]   might have a very powerful social search engine.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.260]   There's a, that StumbleUpon surprises me.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.100]   They are a lot of members.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.900]   They have a fake.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.740]   3 million.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.580]   That's a lot.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.260]   I mean, that's a basic people finding sites.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.460]   I mean, it's like a hollow in some ways
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.220]   because they've got these humans looking for sites.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.700]   It's a very, very, the same way delicious and StumbleUpon.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.220]   But they both do a really good job of discovery.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.540]   They're not really good at search, you know,
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.340]   for the top 10 results that you're looking for.
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.580]   What they're really good for is.
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.620]   Serendipity.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.460]   Serendipity.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.940]   So you type an iPod but you want like,
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.900]   will it blend iPod or, you know, I don't know.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.220]   It's funny iPod stuff or interesting iPod stuff.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.100]   How to hack your iPod.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.060]   They, they excel at that.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.340]   So I think that's why they bought it.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.220]   I think it's their like little, you know,
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.780]   tactical nuke where they can say like,
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.700]   hey, you know, Google, if you take us out of organic listings,
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.500]   we're going to make StumbleUpon a search engine.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.140]   Was Skype Ebay's Broadcast.com?
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.540]   Is that a complete waste?
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.900]   No, they're going to sell it to Google
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.460]   and they're going to make money on the transaction.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.540]   You heard it first.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.540]   Wow.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.860]   I got some, I got some inside knowledge on it.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.340]   For two billion?
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.300]   They're going to make money on it.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.140]   It's going to be worth more.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.340]   It's probably three or four billion.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.300]   Really?
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.140]   I think so.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.300]   I think there's a good bet here.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.140]   There's a good bet here.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.060]   I think they're going to sell to Google at a loss.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.540]   I think they're going to, I think they'll make money on it
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.380]   actually.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.940]   It's a very, it's a very powerful thing.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.380]   If you think about it for Google, it's a huge deal.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.380]   No, no footprint in instant messaging.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:46.180]   No conceivable way to compete with AOL or the combined Microsoft
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:51.100]   Yahoo juggernaut in IM or just a Yahoo juggernaut in IM.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.740]   And it's not an open standard and they could really do some
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.420]   damage with that.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.220]   And it also is good for a global presence.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.780]   And Google is the most global of companies.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.300]   It's good for Android.
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.180]   A slight from that though.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.060]   I mean, how is it monetized?
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.140]   It is good for Android.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.100]   It would be monetized.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.580]   Please do not bring monetization into this discussion.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.700]   It's the most--
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.180]   We're talking about business here.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.140]   The idea of making money is completely tertiary.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.420]   These are some very valuable eyeballs, young man.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.380]   No, I think you can see it.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.020]   I think there's a much better synergy between Skype and
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.940]   Google than there ever was with Skype and eBay.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.900]   That's crazy.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.020]   A large percentage of Skype users pay money to do
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.780]   outbound calls.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.940]   And that's a business right there.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.380]   And Google could certainly make money off of that.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.820]   Well, I think the monetization is a problem, though.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.420]   I think Don brings up a good point.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.660]   Because Skype, not enough of its users pay money to make out
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.900]   of that because they were not owned by-- if they were not
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.020]   owned by eBay, I think they would be in trouble right now.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.220]   I think Skype is the voice--
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.020]   Like they aren't making money.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:46.980]   --is the voice in what's Google by.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.420]   I think Skype is the VoIP winner.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.780]   I think Skype is beating Vonage.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.540]   It's beating CallVantage, AT&T.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.780]   It's beating everybody.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.620]   If you're going to have VoIP, you're going to end up using Skype.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.620]   It's true, but--
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.340]   It's because they have a huge blanket of eBay protection.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.540]   And they haven't made the mistake of trying to give out
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.020]   hardware.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.620]   No, but they do-- there is hardware.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.860]   Actually, they do give out hardware.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.620]   And they have to give out some--
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.940]   You get to choose.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.540]   And that's the point.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.940]   Skype, you can operate computer to computer.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.020]   Or if you want to make it a complete VoIP standard.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.060]   And by the way, they're very smart because they completely
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.380]   avoided the 911 issue.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.620]   They just say, hey, don't use this for emergency calls.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.620]   So let's get back to this insider information that Jason just
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.500]   blew out of the water here with his knowledge
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.020]   that they're going to, for sure, since he knows,
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.540]   sell the product to Google.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.220]   Where'd you get that?
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.580]   I know people who are involved in the transaction business.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.580]   And it's been--
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.580]   No people.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.220]   No people.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.700]   And it's been hot or not.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.660]   This is been discussed on and off.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.660]   Aren't they not supposed to talk about it?
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.580]   Yeah, I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.340]   They don't talk about it.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.780]   Listen, it's basically been--
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.580]   It's been in discussions for over a year.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.020]   eBay has not been able to make it work.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.060]   They've been criticized for it.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.620]   And that's why when they change the management,
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.540]   then they'll probably figure out what to do with it.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.580]   Steve Chen told me that when Google was about to buy YouTube,
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.660]   that he and Eric Schmidt met at the iHop down the road from Google.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.340]   So folks, who are the Skype guys?
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.140]   Go look for some weird--
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.340]   Oh, they're not involved anymore.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.620]   Yeah, those guys are going gone.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.860]   Go look for Meg Whitman and Eric Schmidt having a pancake.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.860]   As it were.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.580]   As it were.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.260]   It's a lot.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.420]   I mean, actually, other than you can--
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   I'm going to kick with who, Leo.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.580]   Even if it doesn't--
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.260]   Even if it doesn't-- if you didn't have that rumor,
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.380]   the minute you said that, Jason, it clicks, it makes sense.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.580]   No, it's a negotiation right now.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.700]   And there's three or four moving parts.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.500]   You have the changing management.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.580]   And so the new person who comes on board's got to believe in doing
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.060]   the transaction versus keeping it.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.780]   People have to save face like Meg Whitman's legacy.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.700]   And then there's also this very tenuous relationship
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.980]   between eBay and Google about the organic listings
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.580]   and about how much money eBay spends.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.460]   eBay was going to stop spending money on Google AdSense
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.220]   because they didn't get the listings they want.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.980]   But if they let them have the listings, then like you would see
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.060]   eBay more often than Wikipedia in Google results.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.420]   And so they've basically--
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.260]   That's an interesting kind of currency, isn't it?
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.620]   There is a whole--
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.380]   Forget cash.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.820]   We'll give you listings.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.980]   If you want to get into the dark stuff in the back rooms,
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.860]   there is some back room stuff going on about how eBay is
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.260]   represented in Google results.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.740]   And you only have to look at the comparison shopping engines,
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.180]   which got kicked out of the search engine results recently.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.580]   And then last year, and their whole business
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.820]   got turned upside down by it.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.900]   So Google's got a lot of power.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:41.540]   Yeah, that's much--
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.220]   Maybe Yahoo will buy that.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.940]   No, no.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.940]   Please.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.300]   I mean, the other opportunity for them
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.700]   would be something like MySpace has done pretty well
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.780]   with their instant messaging.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.940]   If you look at people's communication
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.500]   within the web browser on MySpace or even on Facebook,
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.140]   it feels more like instant messages.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.380]   Yes, that's what my kids use them.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.140]   I wouldn't be surprised if a Facebook even gave
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.460]   them equity or something like that.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.380]   And some sort of Facebook--
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.220]   That would be very hard to do because Facebook doesn't
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.020]   have the cash.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.180]   But wouldn't it be great to embed VoIP into one
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.220]   of these social network services?
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.220]   Or just instant messaging.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.380]   I mean, when I was at AOL, I mean,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.500]   the biggest paranoia amongst people there was like, oh, my god,
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.100]   Facebook and young people are not opening game accounts.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.180]   They're opening MySpace pages.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.860]   They don't feel the need for instant messaging.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.020]   They just refresh their page.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.020]   Exactly how my kids use it.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.500]   Now, interestingly, when you try to do that on Facebook,
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.100]   it knocks you off.
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.980]   It says you're trying to use this to IM.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.260]   You can't.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.420]   But that's probably because they didn't have the resources.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.580]   So are you trying to say that Google would buy Skype
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.700]   to use it, Premiere, or Facebook would take a second
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.740]   and just to use it as IM?
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.860]   Yeah, it would be a great--
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.620]   I mean, a lot of people use it for just IM now.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.620]   And so it would be like--
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.380]   Because if you look at IM, AOL and Messenger now
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.300]   supports VoIP.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.180]   And that's sort of--
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.140]   Well, so does Google, really?
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:01.700]   G-Talk?
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.580]   All these things are merging.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.540]   So the difference between instant messaging VoIP
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.060]   is negligible now.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.460]   But actually, it's a good play on all those levels,
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.860]   because I think it is a good VoIP play.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.860]   I really think Skype is the VoIP player now.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.540]   And it makes sense.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.180]   You agreed with me when I said Android, that Android could
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.380]   use something like this.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.220]   I think it makes sense for them in terms of Android.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.340]   But I guess I still don't see them buying it.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.380]   I certainly see it as a partnership on some level.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.540]   And I think it would make sense to have
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.940]   a recognizable VoIP client built into Android.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.660]   But I think they can probably accomplish that without buying it.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.620]   I guess I just don't see Google wanting to operate
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.140]   that kind of service.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:40.900]   They already have it.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.020]   I mean, Google talk.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.020]   You have nobody to use.
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.380]   They have it there.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.660]   But they're not putting a lot of power--
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.500]   You just said that you don't see them wanting to.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.700]   And they do want to, because obviously, if they didn't want
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.100]   to, they wouldn't have Google talk.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.100]   Yeah, they wouldn't want to.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.180]   They'd built it, and they doodled it out there.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.380]   And then they haven't put any firepower behind it whatsoever.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.620]   It's obviously not one of their top priority projects.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.260]   Well, that's just a Google culture
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.380]   that you're talking about there, Molly.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.180]   That's-- what you're--
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.900]   Yeah, yes.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.420]   --actually saying--
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.140]   Because I think they are not permitted.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.620]   Well, no, that's just their operations.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.140]   The Google is not committed to fully maintaining a service
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.140]   like that.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.300]   No, they are.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.700]   They have an organic philosophy of product development,
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.780]   which is it'll break when it breaks.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.340]   It'll boom when it booms.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.660]   And they don't try to force any issues.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.900]   They have their monopoly slash almost a monopoly,
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.500]   duopoly with search ads and search.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.540]   And they'll wait.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.100]   They're patient.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:31.940]   Wait for Gmail.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.460]   Wait for G-Talk to rise.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.260]   They're not going to shove it down people's throat.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.980]   It's not their corporate culture.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.820]   That's like a Microsoft AOL Yahoo kind of thinking,
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.900]   like we have to get market share.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.100]   Google doesn't work that way.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.140]   Speaking of Yahoo has been fun.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.940]   You mentioned this on Buzz out loud, Molly, to watch the Yahoo
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.780]   executives leave one by one on Twitter.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.300]   And the layoffs, mostly.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.100]   That's the satisfying.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.220]   Oh, yeah, the layoffs, yeah.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.460]   Well, executives are leaving too.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.180]   Everybody's leaving.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.820]   Well, wouldn't you?
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.260]   Yeah, the last vice president of Yahoo,
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.180]   please turn out the lights.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.020]   Well, here's my question about it, though.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.460]   If you're Jerry Yang and you care so much about the company
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:11.500]   and the people, does he think that those thousand people
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.340]   who wouldn't have kept their jobs in a Microsoft deal?
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.220]   I think they would have.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.260]   Microsoft wants more stuff.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.060]   They want more people.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.100]   Really?
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.820]   They don't have that knowledge base.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.340]   Half of what Microsoft wants to buy
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.100]   is the brains and search and the brains.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.260]   But they're all this overlap.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.980]   Don't you think a lot of people would-- more people
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.420]   would have lost their jobs?
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.900]   And accounting and sales and some other areas.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:37.420]   But they don't have any search group in Microsoft
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.420]   as small compared to--
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.500]   So the geeks would have kept their jobs.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.220]   I think so.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.180]   But there's still going to be more than a thousand layoffs
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.220]   in office personnel alone.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.260]   I have a different story.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.100]   And I'm not going to say I'm right or wrong
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.220]   or Jason's not correcting this.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.260]   But I did get a memo from somebody
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.020]   who claims to be working at Microsoft.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.460]   And they tell me that they actually
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.180]   have a huge search department that they set up
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.140]   some couple of years ago with a slew of PhDs similar
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.380]   to the Google operation.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.580]   And they're in a skunk works.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.660]   And they've developed one thing after a question of these
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.140]   promises, promises, promises with the Microsoft search engine.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:16.700]   Because they always--
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.020]   say, oh, we're going to do this.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:18.620]   We're going to do that.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.580]   They roll out a new version.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.580]   It still sucks.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:20.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.220]   They got Ms. Dewey.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.500]   Microsoft's put in all their money into Ms. Dewey.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.380]   You know Ms. Dewey, right?
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.220]   Here comes Ms. Dewey.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:27.740]   No, I don't.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.340]   She's the search engine with that.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.460]   Say, again, somehow.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.020]   Come, go to Ms. Dewey.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.780]   Have you-- go to MSDWY.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.500]   This is another one of these lame brain ideas.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.780]   But the point is is that--
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.220]   That's where all those people are going.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.340]   Can we help you find something?
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.500]   I just don't see the fact that buying--
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.820]   I think buying people from Yahoo is one thing.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.940]   But buying--
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.180]   Microsoft's such a not invented here company.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:55.100]   I can't see them buying the expertise of any company.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.980]   I mean, they usually bring them in.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.460]   They suck them dry for about a year,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.500]   and then they fire them all.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.580]   Or they guys quit and disgust.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.180]   I mean, this has happened over and over again.
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.860]   You can talk to anybody that came over from any one
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.940]   of these companies like Hotmail, for example.
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.660]   They were all out of there within no time.
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.700]   Yeah, I mean, can you imagine they'll
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.420]   keep both Yahoo mail and the Hotmail people?
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.220]   Ah, I don't think any of this is going to happen.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:15.900]   I don't see that happening.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.420]   All right.
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.380]   Now that would now work this time to take off the gloves,
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:22.180]   because Molly wanted to be on with Don.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.980]   Because Don has a theory.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.340]   It's true.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.380]   I'm here to pick a fight with Don.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.580]   I know.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.580]   Tom Merritt told me about it.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:34.500]   Anyway, so basically, Microsoft doesn't even want Yahoo.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.940]   It's my thought.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:40.660]   And if you trace it back to the Intuit deal back in '94 and '95,
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.260]   it looks awfully similar.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.220]   I mean, basically, Microsoft's getting killed by Yahoo,
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.220]   just like they were getting killed by Intuit.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.900]   They don't really want to spend the money.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.620]   They don't really want to spend the money to go out
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.900]   and do the things they need to do.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.700]   So instead, they'll just go in and say to Yahoo, we'll buy you.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.460]   Because it makes sense.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.660]   They can capitalize on it now.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.740]   Because right now, Yahoo's not doing well at all.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.300]   And even the shareholders can't stand the executives
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.580]   and what they're doing with the company.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.260]   So they walk in.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.060]   They say, here, we'll give you $45 billion, whatever the case
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:07.980]   may be.
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.100]   And as soon as the Department of Justice gets involved,
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.860]   because I don't think anyone can actually
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.140]   believe the Department of Justice and EU
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.220]   is going to let this happen.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.220]   I don't even think Microsoft believes it's going to happen.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.980]   So the Department of Justice walks in, says no.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.180]   Microsoft says, oh, OK.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.460]   And all the while, they've been taking notes on what Yahoo's
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.220]   up to, what they're going to do in the future.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.860]   And they walk away.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.660]   And now they have a better product, just like they do with Intuit,
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.140]   when they had Microsoft money.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.460]   So Molly, Don says they just want to look under the kimono.
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.060]   OK.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:38.140]   Here's where things start to break down first.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.380]   Do you really think that Microsoft is that afraid of Yahoo?
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.940]   Like, I'm not--
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.940]   You need to have Google.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.620]   --the Intuit analogy only works.
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.500]   No, of Yahoo.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.020]   Oh, I see.
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:46.580]   Like, they didn't do it.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.420]   And analogy works.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.220]   Because Intuit was, in fact, kicking Microsoft's tail up
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.580]   and down the court.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.340]   I don't think--
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.940]   That was the end of it, though.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.380]   No, come on.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.220]   No, MSAs is not--
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.940]   --insurf this.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.140]   Insurf is possibly.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.860]   But I don't think that there's a technology mojo there
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.500]   that Microsoft can't emulate.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.380]   Yahoo may have better brand awareness.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.980]   But that is the exact reason that Microsoft
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.740]   would want to buy them.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.300]   Like, there's not some--
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.380]   I really don't believe that Microsoft is trying
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.420]   to acquire a bunch of Yahoo engineers who
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.300]   have some super secret knowledge of how to build search
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.180]   at algorithms and online email programs that are so much
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.180]   more powerful than Microsoft.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.860]   There's another big hole in your argument, Don, is that that kind
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.820]   of presumes that the regulators will stop them.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.900]   And I don't know if that's a given.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.020]   I don't even know if Microsoft could assume that.
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.540]   Yeah, that is my second point of argument.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:39.020]   In a world where the regulators approve Google DoubleClick,
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.580]   not approving Microsoft Yahoo would be tantamount to basically
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.940]   supporting Google.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.140]   Yeah, but see, I mean, I don't think regulators--
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:45.620]   You think the regulators--
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.340]   --will the same way.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.420]   I think regulators feel fine with Google DoubleClick
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.700]   because they like Google, right?
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.060]   But they can't stand Microsoft.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:51.900]   They never have.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.700]   The EU really hates Microsoft.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.580]   It's true that you--
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.220]   --Microsoft.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:55.700]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.900]   But this is an astrategy--
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.580]   --Microsoft counting on the EU to stop them.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.140]   No, I think what you're missing is that it goes far beyond
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.060]   email and search.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.060]   I think, like, for example, at CES, I was speaking with Yahoo
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.860]   and they're showing me all the future of mobile advertising,
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.620]   what they want to do.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.660]   And even their Yahoo go 3.0 and all these other things,
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.140]   they're really slick, they're really neat.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.420]   And if you look at Microsoft, there's nothing there.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.660]   I mean, so I don't think necessarily it's Microsoft
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.820]   saying we need search, we need email.
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.660]   I think it's Microsoft saying we're
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.460]   getting our butts kicked all over the court in advertising.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.020]   Mobile advertising is going to be--
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.060]   in a lot of ways, going to be the future of this business.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.580]   And we have no presence there.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.020]   Yahoo is really kind of ahead of the curve in that way.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.100]   And if it doesn't go through, look what we have.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.700]   We have notes on our competition.
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.820]   We have notes and technologies that can affect us going forward.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:47.320]   And--
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.980]   But once again, once again, even with the Intuit
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.540]   argument, you've still--
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.580]   at the time of the Intuit fake acquisition,
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.420]   they were making a competitive product that was losing.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.940]   If your argument is that Microsoft
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.860]   wants to get into the mobile advertising space
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.820]   and Yahoo's made all this headway and Microsoft has nothing,
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.380]   then why would they learn how to build it
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:07.460]   and then take the time to build it?
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.580]   In this world, there's no time.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.700]   They would just buy it.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.860]   Let's get Jason to adjudicate.
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.300]   What do you think, Mr. Callicanis?
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.940]   Microsoft really wants the product.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.380]   They really want Yahoo.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.820]   They really want the staff.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.660]   They want to transform Microsoft into an advertising
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.380]   base business.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.620]   And they need a transformative purchase to do that.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.460]   They know they're not going to do it organically.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.780]   They've tried for over a decade.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.380]   Are they going to get it?
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.860]   Yes, of course.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.780]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.180]   It's a negotiation on price right now.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:35.860]   They're going to get it.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.740]   And it'll probably be done this week, I would say.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.700]   There's absolutely no chance of it not going down
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.500]   because the shareholders are already
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.420]   one after another, the large shareholders,
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.860]   telling bomber, OK, we're done.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.180]   And we'll take the money.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.580]   Interesting point, though.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.940]   Somebody raised-- I think it was in the journal
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.180]   that many of these institutional shareholders hold
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:00.740]   as same amount or more Microsoft than they do Yahoo.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.140]   So while they get a bonus by selling to Microsoft
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.460]   on the Yahoo side, it may cost them on the Microsoft side.
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.580]   They may not be totally into this.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.580]   People hold--
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.540]   Can I chime in?
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.660]   Yeah, John.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.100]   First of all, Don, I kind of agree with Don,
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.540]   because I've kind of written the same thing
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.260]   and a piece of my call.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.180]   But I'm sticking with the assertion
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.500]   that the EU is not going to let this thing happen to begin with.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.380]   And I'm also on Jerry Yang's side.
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:30.620]   That stock was at $35 a share within six months.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.220]   I mean, giving them from 20-- because it sunk down to 20
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.620]   and they offer them 30 bucks, it's nonsense.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.020]   They've offered them 40 in the past.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.460]   They're going to have to cough up at least $40 a share
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.260]   or more to get that company.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.660]   And that's going to be a huge hit for Microsoft's bottom line.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.660]   Can they come up with that kind of--
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.260]   There's a lot of business factors involved here.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.300]   I mean, Microsoft's a company that is never--
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.180]   they don't carry debt and they never want to.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.060]   And this deal, they're probably going to have to carry debt,
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.820]   even though they want to go 50/50 stock cash.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.740]   So I'm not one to believe that Microsoft
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.060]   is dumb enough to not do the research and say, well, gee,
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.740]   really, honestly, what are the chances of this thing going through?
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.740]   If you look at it from an objective point of view
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.260]   and you look at the current tenor of legislators
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:17.260]   and even the way these legislators feel about Microsoft,
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.980]   I don't see anyone objectively can say
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.380]   that this is absolutely going to happen.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.980]   I don't think there's any way to say that.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.220]   Well, it's not even that.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.380]   Can they say that objectively, he's not going to happen?
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.220]   And that's the thing.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.060]   It's a gamble.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.460]   I think you can with the EU.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.940]   But let me just say something in defense of Calicana's here.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:36.460]   He is expressing the exact litany of everybody in Silicon Valley.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.660]   Microsoft has to do this deal.
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.500]   They're screwed up.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.940]   They need to own this company.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:41.660]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:42.660]   I've heard it a million times.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.460]   They all say exactly the same thing.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.940]   And it makes logical sense when you hear it from that perspective.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.260]   But the fact of the matter is I think there is some naivete
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.620]   about where the EU stands on this,
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.860]   because they've already just made a public comment.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.780]   You can listen to the woman who runs the competitive council.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.020]   She says, look, we're done with Microsoft for the moment.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.340]   We're going to go back after them over the browser deal
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.580]   and the fact that they still have the browser link
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.460]   to the operating system.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.860]   And then we're going to go after them again after that.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.260]   They're right in the target, the sites of the EU.
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.500]   This deal is never going to happen.
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.500]   It's never going to happen.
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.500]   It's not going to happen.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   It's going to happen.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   It's going to happen.

[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:16.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:30.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:39.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.500]   You're going to kill it.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:57.500]   You've confirmed it for us.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.500]   You're all the people that don't work.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.500]   I'm becoming a Republican.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.500]   First, the Republican Convention
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.500]   declares Google their national
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.500]   conventions official innovation
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.500]   provider.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.500]   Whatever the hell that means.
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.500]   What does that supposed to mean?
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.500]   I think it's still not doing that
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.500]   neutrality.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.500]   I need an innovation provider.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.500]   I don't know what that means.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:21.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:42.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.500]   I'm going to kill it.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:49.180]   On the GOP side, there'll be Google Apps, Google Maps, Sketchup, and a customized search tools
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.020]   will make navigating the site easier.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.500]   It seems like that could be a good Gilbert and Sullivan song.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.500]   Google Apps, Google Maps, Sketchup.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:51:02.500]   You're going to see these guys jockeying for position for various Secretariat state positions,
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.500]   the ambassadorships.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.500]   I think Eric Schmidt would love to be the ambassador to Great Britain.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.500]   Listen to this.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.500]   Chad Hurley, founder of YouTube, says we look forward to working with the Convention Committee
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.500]   and watching the action unfold.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.500]   In other news, Chad Hurley is now a super delegate.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.500]   I think so.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   Oh, so they're just providing them with...
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.500]   It's a business deal.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.500]   It's the...
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.500]   What YouTube has been doing for all the debates.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.500]   So this means the Republicans are just making a bigger deal out of it.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.500]   They're trying to make it seem like Google endorses Republicans.
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.500]   Yes.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:36.500]   It's hilarious because they're the ones who first wouldn't even most of the candidates didn't
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.500]   even want to do the YouTube debate, and said that it wasn't demeaning.
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.500]   But wait a minute now, according to...
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.500]   Now they're all about the Goog.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.500]   They're all about the Goog.
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.500]   According, that's right.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.500]   They changed their mind, isn't they?
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.500]   That's right.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:52.500]   According to Hitwise, poor people are more likely to use Yahoo.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.500]   Rich people use Google.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.500]   So maybe there's something to it.
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:01.500]   So can we find out whether Eric Schmidt's a Republican or Democrat you people from CNET should know?
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.500]   I'm looking at them.
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.500]   They know everything about Eric.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.500]   I'm just routinely a rich CNET.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.500]   Has that hit?
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.500]   By the way, has Eric dropped his ban?
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.500]   You call him off it.
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.500]   Has Eric dropped his ban on CNET?
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.500]   Does he now give...
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.500]   It was a one year ban.
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.500]   So it's up, I think.
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.500]   One years over.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.500]   He was not talking to us for one year.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:28.860]   So what they did is Hitwise does those clusters, the socioeconomic clusters, and the clusters who
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:34.500]   use Google the most are affluent suburbia, upscale America, and small town contentment.
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:40.820]   The people who use Yahoo the most are struggling societies, blue collar backbone, and remote
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:41.820]   America.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:46.380]   All of them spend less money.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:49.700]   The reason that's skewed is because they have a big dial up deal.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.660]   So it's probably the SPC dial up kind of stuff.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.780]   And also they've been around longer than Google.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:56.780]   So it's like AOL.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.500]   The longer you've been around, the more you get the laggards.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   All of them make sense.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.220]   So Google hasn't gotten their laggards yet.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.300]   We'll get them.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.540]   The dumb people will come along.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.700]   No, I mean it is.
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.420]   Well, I think actually what you mean is that pretty soon we will be the dumb people.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.420]   It might be.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.580]   The people who are currently using Google and then the new hot thing will come along and
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.140]   we won't be up on it.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.340]   Explain this study as long as we're talking about web usage studies.
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:22.380]   This is from Starcom Media Vest.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:28.180]   Six percent of web users generate 50 percent of the click throughs on banners.
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.180]   50 percent.
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.180]   Ooh, CD.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.900]   Well, you know what?
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:38.860]   You're not far off because listen, most have incomes under 40,000 and their clicks are not
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:41.100]   related to any offline buying.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:44.580]   They're mostly males between the ages of 25 and 44.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:47.260]   And what they click on has nothing to do with brand awareness.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.820]   It sounds like they're just punching the monkey.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.700]   There is a specific behavior.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:58.700]   There is a specific behavior where people feel fidgety if they're not doing something
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.700]   with their browser.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.460]   So I've done a lot of user studies.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:05.340]   When you're watching a lab, some people will just scroll up and down and highlight text
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.900]   as they read it.
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.100]   And this is why dig is so successful because they actually give some people something to
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:11.620]   do on the site.
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:14.420]   It may be meaningless to click all the votes on the homepage because the stuff's already
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:15.580]   on the homepage.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.660]   But it makes those kind of people feel better.
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.540]   You know, like the Atari generation.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.540]   I do that.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.620]   I'm always scrolling and highlighting and running around on the page.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:24.620]   Absolutely.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.620]   What is this?
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.620]   I don't know.
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.620]   Do they already plummeting CPM issue?
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.260]   Oh, this is bad news for advertising.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:30.260]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.260]   I don't know.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.020]   But this was this was this study was backed by Dakota in America online, I believe.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.980]   And so you have to wonder why would they do that if they're there in the display advertising
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.740]   business and they didn't know what the results would be.
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.740]   No, no, no, no.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:42.740]   This is there's a specific agenda here.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:47.380]   What it is is they want to increase the value of display advertising.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.700]   So what they're trying to say is don't worry so much about the clicks.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:52.700]   It's the impression.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.700]   Yes.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.700]   That matters.
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.700]   And don't count.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.740]   But I think it's a very stupid gamble because if they like the clicks, let them have the
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.980]   clicks, you know, I'm an advertiser.
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.580]   I'm saying I don't want these $40,000 a year guys.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.580]   Get rid of them.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:07.460]   Well, those guys have money too.
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.140]   But anyway, here's Eric Schmitzer.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.140]   Obviously Republican.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.300]   I was going to say no, he's a total Democrat.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.300]   No, he's a Republican.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.220]   And he gave his last contribution was to Ron Paul.
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:22.020]   And he's listed as Republican by the fund race 2008 Huffington Post at politicalbase.com.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:26.180]   He's listed as having given $25,000 to John Kerry for president in 2004.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.500]   News slash they give money to everybody.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.500]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:36.060]   Eric Schmit raising over $125,000 in 45 days for the Republican candidate for Senator Mike
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.060]   Gibbon soon to be open seat.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.060]   Well, maybe he switched.
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.060]   Mm.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.060]   It's equal.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.060]   I should give everybody.
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:45.540]   I would like to see how much they give after they go.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.900]   You give to anybody who's going to win.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:52.180]   You give and there's 25 125 K was just posted on January 14, 2008.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.500]   So I don't see him being a Democrat here.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:55.500]   Wow.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:00.300]   So is Larry Lessig going to run for Tom Lantos's vacant seat?
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.740]   They're trying to draft him.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.740]   Really?
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.980]   He's in Europe right now, isn't he?
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:04.980]   Or is he back?
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.220]   No, but there's a little online movement to draft Larry Lessig.
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.980]   The problem is you'd have to run again in November.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.460]   It's a very brief moment of fame.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.460]   Craftlessig.org.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.460]   And there's a cool video up there.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.020]   I think it's his students doing it.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.020]   I like it.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.020]   Cool.
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:22.500]   I think I like this whole idea of drafting people we like because we know that nobody will
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.140]   put themselves out there to be scrutinized like politicians are.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.780]   So if you draft them.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.780]   So we make them.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:32.100]   Yeah, you sort of make them, you know, have their lives ruined.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.860]   It's kind of nice of like forced representative government.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.460]   So instead of the representative government, we have a whole idea who's in the first place.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.460]   That's how it should be.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.580]   Anybody who wants to be president shouldn't be allowed to be president.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:43.980]   So we have nobody.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.980]   Yeah, we have no.
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.940]   I want John Devorak for city controller.
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:47.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.740]   You want to spend money on what?
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.740]   The bank.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.740]   What?
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.740]   You guys, you run Windows 3.1.
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.340]   Actually, I hate potholes.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.460]   Well, if you'd fill the potholes, if you had a bicycle, you wouldn't worry about it.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.460]   You'd go around to everybody.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.460]   I like bicycles too.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.260]   You sound like the penguin.
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.260]   He does.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.260]   He does.
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.260]   He does.
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.100]   Do you want to give me Stuart or something actually?
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:13.900]   I can do Devorak and Adam Curry on the same podcast.
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.260]   Hey, what's going on?
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:16.260]   Devorak.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.260]   Hey, it's on the show.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.260]   Nah, I don't know about this.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.540]   Nah, Adam Curry.
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.380]   That's exactly what it sounds like.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.380]   It's his Edward G. Robinson.
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:29.540]   That's just the guy, the wigam, chief wigam.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:30.540]   Who is Edward?
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.540]   Basically you, John.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.540]   Hey, John.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:36.940]   I really, let's get some doughnuts.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:39.740]   So if this were the Simpsons, John would be chief wigam.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:45.540]   Could you just real quick say Jason would be Burns, right?
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:46.540]   No, no.
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.540]   Why is that?
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:48.540]   That's so bad.
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:49.540]   Excellent.
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.140]   Being out the hounds.
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:54.180]   Molly, you'd be, you'd be.
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.180]   Lisa.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.180]   Would you be, Lisa?
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.180]   Yeah, she'd kind of be Lisa.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.180]   Thank you.
