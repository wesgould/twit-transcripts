[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   December 3rd, 2006. 50 Plus.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   [ Music ]

[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   This weekend tech, we're going to do with apologies to Andy Walker,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   the over 50 version since I am now officially over 50.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Devorak apparently has declined.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   But Jerry Pournell is here and our senior member in more ways
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   than one of the Twit panel. It's great to have you on Jerry.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Welcome back from a beautiful studio city California.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   From the nation's capital, Washington DC.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   This name, the US, when I say the nation's capital,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I have to be careful where global podcast could be anywhere.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Frank Barnico of MarketWatch. Great to have you.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Frank, I've wanted to get you on the show for a long time.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   You've written more about podcasting than probably any other
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   columnist out there, at least mainstream columnist.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Thank you, Leo. It's very generous of you to invite me.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Well, you've always been very kind to Twit, so I had to.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   In fact, I had to talk about what you've done.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I had to talk you into it.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I've been trying to get you on since podcast expo.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I'm so glad you could join us.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We'll be talking about a couple of recent columns, actually,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   that Frank wrote.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And from Toronto, my good friend haven't talked to him in ages.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Mr. Andy Walker, formerly of Call for Help.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And now of, of course, cyberwalker media, where he does lab rats,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   which is a great video podcast.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Hello. Hello from Toronto.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Blustry Toronto at that.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Is it cold and blustry?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Blowing sideways, Leo. Luckily, it's not.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   It's still wet out there.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You were having a heat wave for a while.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   We were having a heat wave? Absolutely.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Absolutely.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   There were no more winters here.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It was in the teens, but Celsius.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   That's warmer than it sounds.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's all global warming.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Exactly. That's what we're blaming it on.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Non-feet of snow in Denver. It's global warming.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Non-feet of snow.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Oh, no.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's something like that.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Jeez.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Are you one of those people, Jerry, who doesn't buy the global warming hypothesis?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Oh, I think there's probably some warming, but since they're also noting there's warming on Pluto,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I'm not dead sure that was man-made.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Well, certainly there are these earthly cycles.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I mean, you know, when I was...
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Nobody learns history anymore.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   There were Viking colonies on the west side of Greenland at one time, dairy farms.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Leaf the Lucky planted one there in 800, and they went...
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Did very well until about 1300 when you got the little ice age and everything just got colder and anything.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So it ain't warm enough to have dairy farms on Greenland yet, so I'm not terribly worried about...
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   How was that milk, by the way, Jerry? Do you remember?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It was pretty good.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It was pretty good.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Us Vikings were...
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We liked a firm in it, you know.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We were talking before we began about...
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I think it was today that the Wall Street Journal had a little debate between Robert Scobel,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   formerly of Microsoft Corporation, the Scobelizer Good Friend, who's now at the PodTech Network,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   where he does his own video podcast.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And Dave Weiner, the guy who really created, or at least certainly popularized RSS,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   and was the guy who added the enclosure tag to RSS that made this podcasting thing possible.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   They were debating whether Microsoft was an innovator.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And I'll just... I'll synopsize for those of you who haven't read the debate.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Scobel, it was, you know, taking Microsoft's side.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Dave Weiner started off by saying, "No, Microsoft's not an innovator.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   They're not an innovator by design."
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   They prefer to follow the tail lights of companies, look for markets.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Once it's a big enough market, they will jump into it and embrace and extend or engulf into a voward event,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   depending on your point of view.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Scobel said, "No, no, there's all sorts of innovation going on in Microsoft."
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Just things like clear type, there's little things that make a huge difference.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Any thoughts from the panel on that?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Is Microsoft, Andy, is Microsoft an innovator?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   No, they're following.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I mean, all you have to do is look at the Zoom.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I mean, the Zoom is a big, fat disaster.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And they didn't even do it well.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   They didn't even copy the iPod well.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   They did it badly.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So this is a classic example of Microsoft following what they know best and missing the boat.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I played a clip on the Windows Weekly a couple of days ago from Ferguson, the guy who hosted the Late Late Show on the CBS.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   He's talking about the Zoom and he says, "The Zoom, it's a Microsoft's attempt to beat Microsoft in the iPod market."
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   To beat the iPod in the iPod market, he said, "It's five years late."
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It was funnier than that.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   There were some jokes in there.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I'm just synopsis.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But the Zoom is a good example of something that's not an innovation, except, well, for a couple of things, is Wi-Fi music sharing that's innovative?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I guess.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I mean, and then I look at Vista, which kind of looks like, you know, Mac OS X.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah, good point.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   What do you think, Jeremy?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I mean, if you follow Microsoft longer than anybody, probably.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Well, I think they do both.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Clear type certainly was important.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It made it comfortable to write books on computers.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I love it.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Especially LCDs.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It made a huge difference.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And man, if you turn off clear type and look at your text on an LCD, you will gag.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Yeah, that is true.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But Microsoft has mostly been a standard setting company.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Their whole goal in life has been to be the people who set the standards, make the standards, and enforce the standards.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And that's how they've become so wealthy.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   It was not an accident.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   The nonsense that this was some kind of an accidental empire is just ludicrous.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Well, what do you think when Dave says that Microsoft's MO, MOI design is to wait until the market's worth billions, let others develop it and then enter the market?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Yeah, I think that's about 80% true.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Well, entering the market is all well and good.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Entering the market is all well and good.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   But here we have Microsoft, huge company, Apple, scrambling with about 5 or 6% of the market with its OS.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And Apple's been out there selling 60 million iPods over at least two years.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And Microsoft's had all the advantage of seeing what Apple has been able to do and comes out with a product that isn't even me too.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Yeah, that's the point.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So I can't give them a lot of credit.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And it's brown though.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   It's brown.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Well, I think there were actually some cool innovations in Zoom, but it looks to me like they had a great hardware product that then some committee came along and said, well, you've got to add this copy protection and that.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And by the way, we better not work with Windows Media Player.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We better not work with the Microsoft music store and killed it.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   You know, it turned into something that was horrible.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I have never been able to figure out what genius decided that works for sure won't work with Zoom.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   It plays for sure.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It won't play.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It plays for nothing.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But let me throw out a red hearing here.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   All right.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Don't say red hearing.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   You work for market watch.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Careful.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Let me throw out what you might consider a red hearing.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   We all are still scratching our head that there's no pod catcher inside.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Driving would be crazy.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I mean, that could have changed everything from a podcaster's point of view.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   But it does have Wi-Fi in it.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And this is something I've been beating for three months, four months.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I found a company down in New Zealand that says they're developing this.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   If you've got Wi-Fi, my gosh, you can get on the internet and let's get streaming radio into these handheld devices.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I mean, it has radio already.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It has FM radio.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Wouldn't that be fantastic that you go to a Starbucks or a hot anywhere with a hotspot?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   You get online and you could listen to this podcast, but you could listen to live podcasts.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   You could listen to live radio.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Wouldn't that be fantastic?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And certainly it's coming.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Certainly it's coming.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Well, that's what I look at the zoom and it does look like the kind of quintessential Microsoft first generation product.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   You know, they do some things right.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   They do some things terribly, but they can always fix.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And I guess that really kind of confirms in some ways what Dave Weiner is saying.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   They don't need to innovate.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   They just need to put something out there and slowly make it better.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And that's what they've done.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   But when you, and again, innovation for Microsoft have been small.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   They make darn good keyboards.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   They have certainly taken over the mice business.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Isn't that funny they have?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You're right.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Well, but Microsoft mice have always been making money and they did.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   They had a lot of innovation in mice.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Now, Logitech beat them.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Logitech beat them to the mouse market, but Microsoft was a very early player.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   They didn't word one come with a mouse.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Don't believe my logitech beat them to the mouse market.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I believe that Microsoft mice have been out there for a long time.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I do remember when Microsoft thought they would get in the soundboard business and they did not put a game player interface.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   You know, a joystick interface on the board.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And when they showed me this thing, they're rolling it out and I said, "But don't you think you?"
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And they're, "Oh, businesses tell us they don't want that."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And I said, "Sure, they tell you that and you're going to sell hundreds of these."
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Just what?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   The fortune 100 loves this.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They do goofy things sometimes.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   But they are also not afraid to throw it away.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   They threw out the sound cards when they weren't going anywhere.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Well, and that's what I'd be nervous about with the Zoom.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I mean, I look at things like Ultimate TV, which was Microsoft's first foray into the Tivo market.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And abandoned.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I mean, just out and out abandoned.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Microsoft's perfectly capable of taking a look at the Zoom in a year and saying, "Hah, never mind."
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And anybody who bought something in the Zoom marketplace and has a Zoom is going to be kind of left out in the cold.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Let's not forget Web TV.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Although that lives on.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   It's now, what is it?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   MSN TV?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I mean, you can't still buy it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Just barely.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   But that is a perfect example.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   In fact, I've raised that point a couple of times when people have asked me about the Zoom is,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I'd want to see some commitment to the platform from Microsoft before I would commit myself.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Well, the question becomes, are they going to make enough money on this subscription model?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Right.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I like the subscription model.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   You know, for a long time I was an iTunes guy, I'd buy the song.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And then with the Zoom, I played with the subscription.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I liked it.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Andy, do you use subscription music?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   No, I buy it.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Do you use subscription music?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   No, I buy it.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   The I buy it.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Jerry, are you a subscriber guy?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   My subscription is to KUSC.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Okay.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   How about you, Frank?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Yeah, I subscribe to Rhapsody.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I love it.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Okay.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   So there you go.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   That's an all you can eat service.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Absolutely.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   And on Tuesdays, I love to see the new releases.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And you pay your 15 bucks, so anything you want, you just put it on your player.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Right.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I like that idea.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.400]   And that, I think, is if you buy a Zoom, will they keep that going if they don't make enough
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.000]   money out of the subscription?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.400]   Well, isn't that the big question?
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.500]   If you're a, you know, how committed is Microsoft to this?
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.000]   On the other hand, somebody will probably come pick it up if--
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.400]   Well, they can't because of the copy protection, right?
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   So if Microsoft--
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.000]   No, no, I mean, somebody will buy it from them.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Oh, maybe.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Maybe.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.720]   I mean, I have to say, it's my first experience with a subscription service.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.200]   And it's, you know what?
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.760]   The Zoom might be great for somebody who's never had a portable player before, so has
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.600]   no investment in any other music store.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.720]   Just, you know, and for somebody like that, here's 30 gigs.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   What are they going to do?
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   Digitize all their albums?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.080]   No, they go on the store and they-- and it was so great.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.000]   I just drag playlists over.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And you know, you get your 15 bucks a month and I can keep doing that.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.200]   The advantage of the subscription service to me, actually to the labels, certainly must
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.920]   be obvious because until a year and a half ago, I wasn't buying CDs anymore.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.360]   I didn't want to go on record stores.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.120]   I didn't want that hassle.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.720]   But Rhapsody has made it possible for me to find new music.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:17.160]   And just tonight, I've figured out, apparently I'm Italian because I'm looking at the Italian
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.160]   top charts and there's stuff in there.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.080]   I love El Divo and a couple of other fellows from Italy and now I've found some Italian
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   women.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.800]   You know, I wouldn't be listening to this material if I couldn't search for it and listen to
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.800]   it on Rhapsody.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.300]   That's actually a good point.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.440]   You don't have to pay a buck a song.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.080]   You already paid the 15 bucks so you could listen to anything.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.720]   That's a really good point.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.880]   That's a very good point.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   I like that.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.880]   Yes, uh-huh.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.760]   It's very appealing.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.360]   And you're not having to bribe a disc jockey to put it up for you either.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   Andy, you're saying something?
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.160]   I was going to say, so how does that work?
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   You take it with you.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.560]   You can take everything with you.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   On the Zoom.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.620]   Now, you can also play it on your Zoom, you know, player, which is not Windows Media
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.620]   Player.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.440]   In fact, it's not compatible.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.760]   I'm not clear on what happens if you put it on another machine, but my sense is you'd
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.240]   be able to play it on another machine as long as you were able to log into your Zoom
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   account.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.720]   The Zoom account is the same as your Xbox Live account.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.480]   So the music is also playable on your Xbox and many people will have their Xbox hooked
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.600]   up to their home entertainment system.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.800]   And this is what I like is the ultimate portability.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.920]   I mean, one of the issues I had with iTunes was, you know, what bought one of those transmitter
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.240]   boxes that would sort of play off of a set of speakers.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.160]   It was like a tubular thing.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.960]   And it wouldn't share because they didn't consider it, you know, under the DRM rules,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   it wouldn't let it.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.400]   And so this is one of the things that would be fabulous if this thing, if model takes
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.680]   off is, you know, you subscribe to that feed, you pay 15 bucks a month, and you play it on
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.280]   anything that you happen to own or are near.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:58.560]   Well, get ready because the record companies in the movie studios are about to try to change
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.560]   their deal.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.040]   Universal Entertainment, according to Reuters, said they're not happy.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.760]   Well, first of all, Universal is the one that gets the payoff.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.000]   It's really, this is the thing about the Zoom that bugs me the most.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.560]   That's a good word payoff for Microsoft.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.280]   The presumption is anybody owns a Zoon's a pirate.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.400]   And so you better pay us a fee for every Zoon sold to make up for all that piracy that's
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.160]   going to occur on our Zoon.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:28.480]   And now Universal says, this is a quote from Universal Music Group, chief executive Doug
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.280]   Morris on last Tuesday, be a nice idea.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.240]   We have a negotiation coming up, not too far with Apple.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.040]   I don't see why we wouldn't do that with Apple, maybe not in the same way.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.760]   He says the Zoon deal was an amazingly interesting exercise.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.640]   Yeah, Universal is going, ooh, this works great.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:53.880]   I've talked to some people who say it was Universal's way of torpedoing the Apple store.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.360]   Say, yeah, we'll make that deal and watch Apple now have to deal with it.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:05.200]   You mean like Microsoft paying to keep the SEO lawsuit a lot by buying clients?
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.320]   Yeah, we'll talk about that SCO case in just a bit.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.800]   It's on life support.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:15.000]   Well, Leo, on this Universal idea of a dollar going to Zoon, we all can expect that the
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.720]   next time Apple or Microsoft wants to talk to a label, they want a dollar and then the
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.280]   next person wants another dollar and prizes go up.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.000]   But I think, constantly, we pay that.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.040]   Did Doug Morris say anything about the artists?
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:34.000]   And so just to talk a little inside baseball here, can you imagine what the Harry Fox agency
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.640]   thought when they saw that Universal was going to get a buck for every Zoon?
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.680]   Now the Fox agency represents a lot of publishers and musicians and collects royalties on their
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.440]   behalf as a collection agency.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.920]   And if Harry Fox agency says, "Hmm, there's money out there and no one's talking to us
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.800]   about it," Mr. Morris may have stepped in something here.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:03.080]   Does this any of this remind any of you of something I grew up watching which was ASCAP
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   and eventually the radio broadcasters, my father was president of NAB before it became
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:15.320]   a TV or whatever, but the National Association of Broadcasters essentially got together
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.720]   and formed BMI, broadcast music.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   Oh, interesting.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:25.760]   To compete with ASCAP because ASCAP was driving radio out of the music business.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.440]   And the competition between the two made for a stable model that everybody could live
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.440]   with.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.480]   I'm wondering if we're not seeing something like that happening here.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.240]   Well, according to the Financial Times, the movie studios now are going to go to Apple
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   because they want to reduce the number of devices that can play back the films that
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.400]   you buy in iTunes.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.480]   They say that allowing people to play it on five different computers and an unlimited
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.480]   number of iPods is too generous.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:04.080]   So pressure on Apple from everybody, including I think Microsoft by doing this deal with
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.080]   the Universal.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.960]   But can't you imagine how dull it would be if you had to watch the latest James Bond
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.640]   on a two inch screen?
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.640]   Right.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.960]   You should be precisely, you know, you buy it, you should be able to play it on other
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960]   devices.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.280]   Hey, let me add Patrick Norton to the mix here because he's always had strong opinions
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   on all of this.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.400]   We're going to join, get Patrick to join the conference.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.680]   He's had a little trouble earlier on with his mic, but we'll see if we've got that fixed
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.680]   here.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.760]   Patrick's always got something to say about this.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.520]   He's a music lover.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.320]   He's probably against the idea of a dollar to Microsoft.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:43.360]   Now you say a dollar Frank Bernacco, but do we really, I don't think we know the amount.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.720]   It could be a dollar, it could be a hundred dollars, it could be ten dollars.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.480]   We don't, I don't know if they've said the amount.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.200]   I think they've been cagey about that.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   Patrick, are you there?
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   I'm here.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   Hey, you sound great.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.680]   Well, let's hope so.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:02.080]   So, welcome to the conversation, Jerry Pournell, Frank Bernacco from MarketWatch, Andy Walker,
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.800]   and now Patrick Norton.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.360]   We've been talking about, we started talking about the Zoom, but now we're talking about
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:13.360]   the record companies and both Universal and the Motion Picture Association now kind of
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.880]   making some assertions that they want to change their deal with Apple.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.960]   The record companies would like a little bit of a payment like Microsoft's Giving Universal,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.280]   the movie studio say, we don't want to see it on five computers.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.200]   We should see it on fewer computers.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.320]   Let me actually start with you, Patrick.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.760]   We were talking as we led into this about the Zoom and subscription music.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.640]   Do you buy each song or do you do subscription?
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.280]   I despise buying individual songs because it just, I like to buy CDs and then encode
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.280]   the music however it went away.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.160]   You don't buy in a music store ever.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.680]   Very, very rarely, but I have to admit, I started playing around with a couple of the
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   monthly subscription fees.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.400]   And when you're looking at something like Urge where they have a bazillion songs and
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.960]   you can access any of them for...
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.120]   Isn't that cool?
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   I like it.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.080]   Basically, the Zoom store is Urge, I think.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.920]   I mean, it's very similar to what's on Urge.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:07.080]   Yeah, I mean, I'm a little disturbed about being, you know, not being able to, because
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.080]   I have an existing Urge account and I can't move all that music onto the Zoom, which
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.080]   I think is stupid.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   That's really stupid, since it's so close to Urge.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.480]   Holy cow.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.920]   Now Urge has a lot of indie artists, the kind of artists you like, Patrick.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.720]   Well, Urge actually has a lot of everything.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.000]   They went down, they, Microsoft got together with MTV and the idea was to basically kick
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.080]   the snot out of every other online music sales service.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.320]   I think it was their goal.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.200]   So everybody else claims roughly a million tunes.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.840]   Is Urge more than that?
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.200]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.040]   But they've got a pretty...
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   One, two, three...
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.680]   Honey, it's dinner.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   Oh, one, two...
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   No, it's...
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.680]   No, but they actually, I mean, obviously they're pretty heavy on the whole MTV.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.320]   Kids, generation thing.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.720]   But the MTV generation, people have been watching MTV for like 20 years, right?
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.440]   And they also have a huge jazz section and classical sections.
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.640]   There's a lot going on there.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   What are we going to do?
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.560]   I mean, Jerry, you were talking about how BMI came to save radio.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.240]   Actually, the radio industry created BMI.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.400]   As a, because ASCAP was bleeding them dry.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.160]   Is there some solution to this problem?
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.720]   I mean, here we have, you know, who's going to win in a bag?
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   This is like...
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.280]   Well, Jeff Bezos' article is going to win a battle between the Silverback Arena.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.360]   Let's go back and look at something.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.960]   One of the things I thought the net was doing, and not just the internet, but the internet
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:45.120]   particularly, but small computers too, was cutting the blood sucking music publisher
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.800]   out of the loop so that the artist might actually get some money without having to rely just
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:58.560]   on performances as a means of making a living because the publisher took everything.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.200]   It looks like that's what they're still trying to do is the publisher just wants to control
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.720]   everything.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.400]   But a lot of young artists have made their reputation by releasing their stuff out on
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.280]   the net almost for free.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.080]   And people saying, "Hey, I like that.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.080]   I'll buy it."
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.160]   I think I have an interesting email from a guy named Jeff Lorber who is a musician, as
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.440]   many, many albums to his credit, jazz musician.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.880]   I think he started in the '70s.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.960]   And he sent me a note saying, "Love, Twit, your podcast.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.200]   I was listening to Mac podcast.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   I have to protest.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.720]   It's painful to listen to you guys putting down record companies.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.080]   If you talk to a real live working musician with a record deal, you'd realize how wrong
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.600]   you are about dishing record companies the way you do, you guys really don't understand
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   the record business.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.880]   You agree that the majors are not by means, any means perfect and have been way slow on
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.520]   getting with technology.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.400]   But he says what they do better than anybody else is marketing.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.600]   He says a band needs the backing of a major label to push them.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.960]   Well, that's assuming the band has to be giant rock star status, if everybody wants to be
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   you know, uncertain.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.760]   I mean, it's like if you want to be--
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:16.640]   You're not going to see another Metallica queen rolling stones without that kind of marketing.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.080]   Well, that's not-- actually, that's dead wrong because Metallica, the entire reason Billboard
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:26.880]   created the college top 20 is because of Metallica and actually-- I can't think of the name of
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   the band from Brooklyn.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.200]   The two guys we used to have on the screen same.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.480]   Oh, they might be giants.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   They might be giants.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.760]   Both they might be giants and Metallica did multi platinum records with no radio play.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.160]   Oh, interesting.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.000]   And what happened was that Billboard recognized that and Billboard was basically watching the
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   college music journal and realized that there was bands that were selling huge ridiculous
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.840]   numbers of albums based on popularity, word of mouth and endless touring.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   Word of mouth and touring.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.480]   And touring and then turned around and created sort of the college top 20 and then the college
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.120]   top 20 of these bands started getting cherry picked by the major labels.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.720]   But you know, Metallica, they did it without, you know, they got huge long before the major
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.080]   labels came sniffing around.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.320]   You know, Alex Lindsey, he always said that he was a record rep and A&R guy-- or no,
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   he was a promo guy right around that time and he said the truth is what really changed
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.520]   it for Metallica was when Billboard changed the way it got reports, when it actually started
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.120]   really measuring accurately sales instead of just calling up the record store and saying,
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.120]   well, how many just sell?
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.880]   Calling up the radio station and saying how many times did you play it?
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.120]   And once there was real reporting, then bands like Metallica really started to show up on
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.120]   the charts.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.960]   Because until that point, the majors and their extraordinary marketing machines--
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   I have no clue.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.640]   --which you might call Paola if you spun it in a different way--
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.000]   --essentially controlled what showed up in the top 40.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Interesting.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.280]   I mean, you know, a long time ago, a really wonderful place in every major city was a
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.000]   tower record store.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.800]   It was just a wonderful thing to walk through and visit and your eyes just lit up because
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.600]   it was so much catalog there you didn't know about.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.360]   And so it was just for all those stories as they will be out of business, I guess, by
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.360]   the end of December.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.920]   Yeah, they're shedding them down.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.000]   That's going to cut volume for the record labels.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.840]   That kind of thing as we all buy fewer and fewer CDs.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   Is that a loss?
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.240]   I feel like that's a loss, isn't it, Frank?
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:28.920]   I think it's a loss, personally, and certainly a loss for the labels and for their sales.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   But I think for consumers--
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   For consumers, for listeners, too.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   Go ahead, Patrick.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.280]   I don't think towers selling quite as many records as you think.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.280]   Not anymore.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   Well, they aren't now.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   They're going out of it.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.840]   I mean, 20 years ago, 2015-18, whatever I was in college in New York City, right?
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.960]   We had J&R Music World, we had four records, you know, Bleaker Pop, some of the smaller
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.800]   places that were scattered around the East Village and in Virgin came in up at Times
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.840]   Square after Giuliani cleaned it up.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.120]   But the guys I knew that worked at Tower Records, whether they were in the jazz section
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.720]   or the classical section or in the pop section, they all said one thing.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   10% of our customers buy 90% of the music we sell.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   That's not changing.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.400]   That 10% of passionate people who come in week after week and buy more and more CDs,
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.040]   whether they're filling out the--
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.720]   Yeah, but I have to point out there, a lot of people like Frank and Frank-- I include
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.000]   myself in this group, too-- who weren't buying music for a long time.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Right.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Who certainly are buying music again.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I see it again.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.280]   For some reason, if I look back at the calendar, when I was 29 years old, 28 years old, I stopped
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   buying music.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.280]   Right.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.280]   That's what they say.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.080]   Your musical interests are frozen to the age of 27.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   And then it's it.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   Right.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.040]   And then what happened was then the whole iTunes phenomenon, the MP3 phenomenon, came
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.040]   along--
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.040]   You know what it was for me?
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.040]   It was Napster.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   Well, you know exactly.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   Me, too.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   And I went, wait a second, online music's the future and now I've started spending money
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.600]   in music again.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   So to me--
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.400]   Napster got me back in the stores initially and then to iTunes Music Store because I was
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.760]   all of a sudden reconnecting with music.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.760]   Go ahead, Frank.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.760]   When I was with Patrick, what--
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.760]   Go ahead, Andrew.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   You finish up.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.760]   I'm not tricking the senses.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.960]   Sometimes I kind of long for that CD days where I can own the media, own the rights
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.960]   to media and actually burn it on demand.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   Frank, what's the solution?
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:15.440]   Well, Leo, you asked for a solution and I just wonder how you all feel.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:21.780]   I think that the movie studios really took the at least time Warner took a real step
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:28.280]   this week in agreeing to have what I will call tiered pricing for downloads of Superman
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.000]   and returns if you buy the DVD at Walmart.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.240]   I think this is a recognition by the studio that these additional uses of product we want
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:42.240]   to put that we want, there's incremental dollars for them to be had there at a reasonable price
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.240]   rather than a gout just--
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   That's smart.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.880]   Instead of saying you have to buy it again and again at a full price, you get a--
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.800]   So what is the pricing structure?
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.000]   I think it's roughly $2 if you want to put it on a laptop.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.960]   It's too long as you want to keep it on your PC and also move it to I believe a Zoom or
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.360]   $397 to do everything.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.880]   Be interested to see how that plays out.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.640]   In principle, that's a great thing.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.880]   It's better than having to pay $20 each time.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.160]   I think this is an opportunity for music labels.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.320]   They can start thinking about this kind because download business, downloading is where the
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.960]   business is going to be.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:24.120]   If you make it reasonable, I mean, I heard someone talk about you know, you cut your
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:32.080]   price on singles, on iTunes to $0.25 and the volume will go up something like five or
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.800]   six times.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.440]   This stuff is price sensitive as you reduce the risk to me as a listener to sample.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.400]   I think there's an awful lot of business in downloading that both the music people and
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.000]   the movie people have to take advantage of as long as they treat it properly and you know
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.080]   what say it looks reasonable to us as consumers rather than getting nailed $15 for a download
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.160]   like the cinema now people do.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.520]   That's a ridiculous pricing structure.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.520]   Let me...
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.520]   Hello?
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.760]   Yeah, go ahead Jerry.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.360]   I don't know a lot about the music business other than that living where I do.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.160]   There are a lot of musicians around and I've talked to them.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.400]   But I know something about the book publishing business.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   The book publishing is now beginning to make deals whereby if you buy a copy of the book
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.720]   in hardbound, you get the electronic rights to it too.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.520]   You get an electronic copy.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520]   I love that.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.320]   I just did that with a computer programming book and it was great.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.240]   And Bain Books actually started that in science fiction.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.040]   That was Jim Bain's innovation.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.400]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   It's a great idea.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.920]   And I'm wondering if something like that might not save the record business.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.600]   Here you get the record and you can go off and rip it, do anything you want to.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.360]   I'm not convinced that's not still the right model.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.160]   Yeah, I'm worried about all the copy protection that's going to be involved Frank in implementing
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.560]   this movie industry wants to implement.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.840]   The book industry has discovered that copy protection just doesn't help me.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   Yes, just don't do it.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   Just give them the media.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840]   Don't do it.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.340]   Now the other thing I'm concerned about is what we call in the book business the mid-list
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:20.180]   writer who is disappearing but may be coming back because of the internet.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:25.960]   This is the guy who writes a book every couple of years who makes a living, maybe he's a
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:32.700]   professor, maybe that's all he does is write books but he gets most of his food intake
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:39.060]   from literary teas and he wears leather patches on his back and so on.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.700]   Those used to be a solid part of the intellectual community.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.540]   We all knew some of them.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:49.580]   They've darn near vanished because the book industry has gone from essentially if you're
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.480]   not a best seller you don't exist.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.740]   Danielle's stealing nothing.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.420]   And well I have managed to make a living through books in this but I have watched this and man
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.260]   I have watched a lot of mid-list authors just vanish.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.380]   But isn't that the promise of the long tail?
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.340]   Well this is what we're hoping.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:11.340]   What saved the mid-list author in the book business oddly enough was Barnes and Noble.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.340]   Really?
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.100]   The last person you'd think.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.660]   Think so but what happened was you had B Dalton and so forth.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.700]   Those were actually fairly small bookstores in malls.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.060]   They didn't have a lot of inventory.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.900]   When Barnes and Noble went to the big warehouses they had to fill the warehouse with something.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.060]   So you come in for the Danielle steal but you stay for the Thomas pension.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.060]   By the Thomas pension or you buy Pernell or you buy Dr. Fred.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.900]   They have huge science fiction rocks in there.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:45.180]   Whereas if you go to the local drug store you'll be lucky to see three science fiction novels
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.740]   if any.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:51.660]   So I'm wondering if there isn't an analogy here between public because publishing is
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.940]   doing pretty well.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:59.500]   We have more people in science fiction writers of America making a living at this junk than
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:05.140]   it's what I do at my racket than we ever had before.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.140]   Really?
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.140]   That's interesting.
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:15.180]   Yes I'm beginning to wonder that model of you either got to be the top 20 or you don't
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:19.140]   exist was what the record companies always did.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:25.420]   But isn't there some way for people to exist just doing good work and getting paid reasonable
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.420]   amounts for it?
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.500]   Why do you have to either be a millionaire or dead?
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.020]   Well isn't that what you were saying Patrick that the model the marketing model for the
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:36.580]   record history is the Metallica's or maybe not Metallica's but the big record groups.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:41.060]   You figure like the you know there's the biggest myth about the movie industry is that the
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.220]   movie industry is about making movies.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.580]   It's a really bizarre banking system.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:51.140]   It's an investment program that happens to advance its funding by risking you know investors
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.420]   money on movies right.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.820]   The record companies have essentially been doing the same thing but on a much smaller
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.820]   scale.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.220]   You're saying the hit model the hit driven model where you have a lot of losers but one
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.660]   in 20s they're going to have to carry the rest.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.980]   And it's like some of the stuff that gets pumped out you know you look at it and you're
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.940]   like how do these people get signed?
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.980]   You know it must have been like the A&R guy must have been really drunk one night and
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.060]   you know somebody owed him a favor or he wanted to sleep with somebody in the band and then
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.620]   like three months later he's in the studio but it's you know he's already got a hundred
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.820]   thousand dollars into him so they're going to be like we've all heard it like an album
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.820]   but somebody's given to us or you know it showed up in the mail yeah and you just look
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.580]   at it and you're like wow this person is passionate and they really want to be
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:38.180]   you know they want to be a star and wow this is just awful you know and which is why you
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.100]   know that's why I don't write music reviews because I don't want to pee on anybody's parade.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.620]   If a good producer can make Brittany Spears a hit I would think that almost anybody could
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.620]   be a hit now.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.060]   With the modern technology you can fix the pitch you can add layered production make
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.060]   anybody sound good.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.780]   Yeah but you know Brittany's also you know she's a hard work in Mouseketeer you know she's
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:02.700]   part of the machine you know I mean she's like you know a lot of people you know.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:07.940]   You know we're not you know we're also wrote a fairly intelligent article about this whole
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.140]   marketing business.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.420]   Brittany Spears did?
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.420]   Yes.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.420]   Must have been Ghost Britain.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.420]   You're kidding.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.420]   No.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.420]   No.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.020]   You can find it online and it's actually quite an intelligent discussion of the whole digital
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:25.180]   rights management and the relationship with the record companies and so forth.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.020]   It's probably one of the better pieces.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.020]   Brittany Spears on DRM on the next one.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.020]   You got it.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.020]   Maybe I should call it.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.020]   You got it.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.020]   We should get them caught.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.020]   And Courtney Love did one too.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:38.300]   Well I know she's very she's very outspoken and and somewhat eloquent on the subject.
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.740]   They won't be debating this in North Korea.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:46.820]   The Bush administration has announced a plan to talk about economic sanctions.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:52.620]   They're not going to allow iPods, plasma televisions or segues in North Korea.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.620]   That's all right to North Koreans don't either.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.220]   Yeah but I bet Kim has one or two.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.820]   He said to have the largest collection of pornography on the planet.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:04.820]   Well there you go.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.020]   Everybody needs a hobby.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.660]   He's a five foot three and an enthusiastic basketball fan.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:12.660]   I don't know.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.660]   But you left out the hair.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.460]   The hair is another six inches absolutely.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:23.020]   I think actually that's an interesting idea in terms of trade sanctions.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:29.220]   Rolexes, French cognac, plasma TVs, yachts, iPods.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.060]   These are things Kim himself wants.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.060]   They are free.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:37.060]   I will gladly do without life's necessities as long as I have the luxuries.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.060]   Exactly.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.860]   Yeah who needs food when you've got a yon?
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.260]   Why feed the people when I have cognac or electricity?
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.100]   The fact that that actually makes sense.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:51.860]   It's the only way to influence the people who really make a decision in there is in fact
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.540]   to deprive the elite of something they want.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.140]   Much better to give them all the food and medicine they want.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.660]   Just keep them from having iPods.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.620]   That seems like a great plan.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.420]   And cut off their porn supply.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.980]   Well maybe that is playing.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.700]   Cut off Brittany and the nuclear proliferation is done.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.700]   It's done.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.700]   Sorry Kim.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:11.700]   I don't know.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:18.100]   With all due respect to the sanctions I'm pretty sure the dictator of a nation with
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:23.300]   nuclear, the beginnings of a nuclear program can probably manage somehow to get an iPod
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.300]   slipped in.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:32.100]   Sure but Kim is number 10 man who actually manages to get in his presence with a revolver.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.940]   Well it's an interesting idea.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:42.300]   There's a quote here from a former Clinton administration trade guy, senior commerce
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.020]   department official.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.180]   He said it's a new concept.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.020]   It's kind of creative.
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:51.060]   They predicted governments will comply with the new sanctions but agreed that efforts
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.940]   to block all underground shipments will be frustrated.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.580]   He says the problem, this is William Rhynch.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.980]   He says the problem is there has always been and always will be this group of people who
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.500]   work at getting these goods illegally.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:09.100]   Small electronics like laptops and iPods are untraceable and available all over the place.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:14.100]   US exports to North Korea, a mere $5.8 million last year.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:21.140]   Hey we should do next is cut off snacks to Iran and we saw that problem too.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.740]   No wheat thins for you.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.740]   Wheat thins.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.740]   Those for you.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.820]   As a plan go ahead Jerry.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:34.940]   Actually our cultural weapons of mass destruction are what are going to bring Iran down.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.140]   You mean movies and television?
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.900]   Movies, television, blue jeans, rock music, iPods, the whole business.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.540]   I mean the Iranian population doesn't much like their government and the only thing
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:51.140]   that would ever unite them would be if we were stupid enough to send soldiers in there.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.300]   That's a good problem.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.700]   Cultural, cultural hegemony.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:59.980]   Cultural weapons of mass destruction and that's one of the reasons why the the Islamists
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   hate us.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.340]   They understand thoroughly well that we're getting their kids whether they like it or
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340]   not.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.220]   I mean wouldn't you rather listen to wouldn't you rather watch Britney Spears on an iPod
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.820]   than sit on the floor and memorize the corrion?
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.060]   The mullah's got nothing on Britney.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.620]   Amber just did a story on this actually Toronto based effort.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:27.500]   You might know about it Andy called siphon P S I P H O N which was just released today
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.660]   at PSI P H O N dot Civisec C I V I S E C dot org.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:36.660]   I think it's Civisec is a citizen lab at the Monk Center for International Studies in
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.980]   Toronto and they've created it's a very interesting idea.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.260]   It is it is a way to get through censorship blocking.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.300]   So for instance you can download siphon running on your computer.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:53.740]   It'll provide a proxy that then will allow your friends and family let's say in China
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:39:01.660]   or North Korea to surf to your proxy and then get out to the internet completely uncensored.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.740]   So it's like tour.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:08.740]   But it's kind of an interesting way of doing it because it's kind of a cooperative thing.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:14.940]   It's open source and it does the one flaw and obviously you can't publicize a widely
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.700]   publicized the locations of these siphon servers.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.140]   They hope they'll be many many hundreds or maybe thousands all over the world.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.940]   You kind of have to pass it around from person to person.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.140]   Here's the pass here's the URL in the password or the IP address in the password.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.500]   Which will happen at the end of the year this was developed at the University of Toronto.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.220]   They have some citizen about citizen lab there.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:40.060]   But this reminds me of if you go back what 20 years now right in the fall of the Berlin
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:46.100]   Wall and they said that 300 bod modems snuck in across the wall was the ultimate demise
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:51.180]   of the Communist regime and and I got to think that perhaps this may be the new millennium
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.180]   version of that.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:56.100]   Jerry's got a point you know who's fun you know who funds this George Soros.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:05.180]   I don't know if that's his intent or not maybe so it would certainly open markets.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:11.180]   I think that what Jerry said essentially is is what's happening here which is you can't
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:16.140]   keep this stuff out you can censor you can try to build a great firewall of China but
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.420]   ultimately this stuff is going to get through.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:24.380]   It'll be interesting certainly I think I spent some time in East Berlin in the mid 80s
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.260]   and it was interesting because I probably could have made a bloody fortune for the tape
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.740]   because that's I had my backpack and lost some magazines at the border.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:38.340]   What you think it's interesting it's going the other way that Russia is with all of MP3
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:44.140]   selling us back our music actually stealing it and then selling it back to us.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.140]   That's just a creative entrepreneur.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.140]   No kidding.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.500]   There's a battle going on around all of MP3.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.340]   Russian and US trade negotiators have agreed on a bilateral agreement which would allow
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.500]   Russia to join the World Trade Organization.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.940]   One part of the deal specifically mentions all of MP3.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:08.060]   This is all of MP3 drives the recording industry in the US so crazy that they managed to actually
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.580]   get them written into this.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.540]   So the Russian government says we'll stop all of MP3.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.820]   All of MP3 says ha ha try.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.860]   We're not going anywhere to come right.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.500]   We're moving to Georgia.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.780]   Right exactly.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:29.620]   I think somebody ought to buy the all of MP3 software.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.700]   The website works like a charm.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.700]   Isn't it great?
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.660]   And service and delivery.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.020]   It's almost as simple as iTunes.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.260]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.260]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.260]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.220]   And I love it for that strange little loophole they claim is their legal justification for
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.460]   being able to sell the music.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.820]   Well they still claim the loophole.
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.820]   Their mouthpiece.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:54.740]   Their high priced mouthpiece who was an attorney in New York City at John Kite represents
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.580]   a vol of MP3.
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.700]   He says all of MP3 is legal.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.860]   It's not going anywhere.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.460]   Have you read what the loophole is?
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.900]   Yeah it's bizarre.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:08.700]   It's basically FM style radio transmitted over cable networks as in cable television
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:09.700]   networks.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.260]   However it's however they've they've loosely interpreted it.
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:19.140]   He says legality is not decided by a legislative branch or an executive branch.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.860]   It's decided by a court.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.700]   And frankly since the courts haven't yet said all of MP3 is illegal nothing's going
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.340]   to happen.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:31.100]   I'm just amazed that the free trade you like our free trade delegation has nothing better
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:37.020]   to do than basically suck up to the lobbyists at the RAA and basically hammer.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.140]   I mean the World Trade Organization is complicated to say the least but it's like they've got
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:46.500]   nothing better to do than to hammer on all of MP3 on behalf of the record companies.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.220]   That just fascinates me.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.740]   This is just this never ends this all of MP3 story.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.700]   It must be just such a burr under their saddle.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.580]   It just drives them crazy.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:00.820]   If you ask the RAA if you call up to get a quote or discuss their opinion on them they
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.300]   immediately send you to the IFP.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:07.340]   The IFP had basically the international photograph association.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.540]   They don't talk about it at all.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.220]   They basically talk to the international.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:13.060]   It's because they froth at the mouth if they start talking about it.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.740]   They don't talk about them at all.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.300]   Steam would be coming out of their ears.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.700]   They're so upset about it.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.700]   Let's see what else.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.700]   Google answers is gone.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.700]   Are we sad about that?
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.980]   That was the kind of bizarre search service that Google offered where you would put a
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:32.220]   search query in a human would answer it.
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.220]   I'm going to have to run.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.780]   I have a party at Danny Hill.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.780]   I understand.
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.780]   And I have to get off to it.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:43.340]   I do want to point out that the government cowtowing to the RIAA is nothing new.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:48.720]   The whole Digital Millennium Communications Act was written by a guy who was a congressional
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:55.180]   staffer who several months after the Act was passed went off and became a very highly paid
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.940]   employee of RIAA.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.300]   They are very good at the lobby business.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:09.020]   Probably the most important outcome of the Microsoft address lawsuit was that Microsoft
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:15.180]   went from having the Washington office be a sales office to the biggest lobby in Washington.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.940]   No coincidences in this stuff.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.940]   If you don't have a lobby, you're not going to get anywhere.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:22.940]   Well, anyway.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.740]   Jerry, I'm going to let you go.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.740]   Have a great time at the party.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.780]   We do thank you so much for joining us.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.420]   And by the way, I just want to mention we were talking before the show Jerry's.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:36.260]   Not only are Jerry's books, of course, still considered by many to be among the top sci-fi
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.140]   books of all time, but one of his great books that's been out of print for a while in
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.940]   Ferno is coming back in print.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.300]   We're doing a sequel, in fact.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.300]   That's great.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.300]   That's what I'm working on.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.300]   No, no.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.300]   Are you?
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.620]   Yes, it starts off in the grove of the suicide with Sylvia Plath.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.620]   So, oh boy.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.620]   I can't wait.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.980]   A light hearted tail.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:59.140]   And are you co-writing that with the...
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.740]   Yeah, Nevin and I are doing that together.
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.740]   That's great.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:03.740]   Well, Jerry, it's always great to talk to you.
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.180]   We'll talk to you again real soon on Twit.
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.180]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.180]   Thank you.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.180]   Take care.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.780]   Jerry Pournell, one of the great, great guys.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.540]   And always fun to have him on.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:15.540]   So let's see.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.540]   What else shall we talk about?
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.220]   There's so many fun stories that we can...
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.300]   Google answers I brought up.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.420]   Any thoughts on that?
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.420]   Do we miss them?
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.420]   Well, not everything that Google does can succeed.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.340]   And to me, it seems like Google's becoming a software company.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:35.700]   There is a new search site called Cha-cha that is trying to do what Google answers did.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.500]   They must look at this and go, "Ooh, that's not good."
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.700]   No, Cha-cha is convinced they have the answer.
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.700]   It's fun.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.540]   If you get a chance to do a meeting with the Cha-cha folks, do it, Leo.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.540]   Really?
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:48.540]   They're irrepressible.
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.540]   I love it.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:50.700]   It's like a jibini cricket.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.700]   CHA.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.700]   CHA.com, right?
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.700]   And it's a live human search.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.700]   Oh, hm.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.700]   In fact, I did get a...
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.940]   I mean, there's somebody at the other end of my screen here who's going to give me an
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.940]   answer, huh?
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:04.940]   Yes.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.940]   I like humans.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:12.460]   I think that over this week, I saw there's a website and there's a network of blogs called
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.460]   glam.com.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.100]   And it's a fascinating idea.
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:23.140]   The fellow spent a number of years putting together, in a sense, a portal of blogs about
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.140]   the fashion industry.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:28.500]   And he's really turned it into a successful operation.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:36.100]   And he came up with the concept of not an editor, but a curator.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.500]   Think of a curator as the editor of the future.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.220]   It's not a person who's telling you what to go out and cover and sending the reporters
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   out.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   It's someone sitting in the...
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:50.700]   Think of it in a horseshoe desk who's looking at all this stuff that's coming in through
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.380]   blogs and saying, "This works.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.380]   Let's put this up.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.380]   Let's put this up."
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.380]   It's kind of like...
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.140]   Kind of like what Drudge does.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.660]   So it's a meta-blog of fashion?
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.660]   Yes.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660]   Yes.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.260]   And he's got the licensing agreements with...
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.900]   And they share advertising back and forth.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:13.460]   And of course, on his own website, glam.com, he's going to highlight some stories from
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.500]   those 200 bloggers he's got working with him, not for him.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.620]   Does it send you off to their blogs?
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:21.620]   Yes.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.620]   And you read the article?
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.620]   Yes.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.500]   So you go to glam.com to find kind of a listing of stories.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.620]   And glam.com looks like a portal.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.620]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.620]   And...
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.260]   It looks deep in glam and I still haven't left glam.com.
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:37.940]   So he has his own stuff as well.
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.100]   Yes.
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.580]   The idea of a curator, I thought, as an editorial role is fascinating.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.580]   I like that idea.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.580]   Fascinating.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.580]   And it's very meta.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.580]   And it's exactly what the net really is all about.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.340]   I mean, that's what a blog...
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:52.300]   For many people, that's what a blog is, is a collection of links to other people's writings,
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.460]   right?
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.300]   You kind of do that in your blog, Frank.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.700]   I mean, you write.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.740]   I mean, it's your columnist, but you also...
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:01.740]   What is your...
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.740]   Yep, I bounce around.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.740]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.100]   Each morning I start off my first post as the 8 a.m.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.620]   headlines.
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.380]   And it's the stuff that is shown up on the blog.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.700]   You remember how David Letterman used to talk about how he was not ready for prime time?
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.700]   Right.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.020]   I pride myself in finding stories that aren't ready for prime time on the market watch
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.980]   site and throw them up on the blog.
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.940]   And occasionally they sneak on to the front page of the market watch.
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.540]   So I'm out there pointing and showing.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.540]   How do you think this works?
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:30.820]   Do you think that you develop an audience that wants to know what Frank Barnico thinks
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.660]   about these things?
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.500]   Do these people go to you and a lot of other people?
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.500]   Or do they just go to you?
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:36.500]   How does that work?
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.140]   Boy, my ego is not that big enough.
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.580]   I think I'm just a reporter.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.900]   I'm just out there scouring and occasionally, unfortunately, since I've been covering the
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.580]   internet for...
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.460]   Forgive me the expression for 10 years.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:51.020]   I do have a memory here and there of things that have happened before.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.020]   And I'll add that.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.020]   I think that's really...
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:57.900]   I really see my role as an editor and a reporter.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:02.620]   And I have the luxury with this thing to write about that in which I'm interested.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.940]   I don't really...
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:07.820]   My eyes glaze over at a lot of news releases I see in a lot of stories.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.820]   And I'm much more focused.
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.340]   I'm much more interested in media.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:11.820]   And that's what we concentrate on.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:17.220]   I think that when I look at your blog or Mike Harrington's blog, there are people like
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.220]   you guys that...
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:23.780]   Well, I trust kind of bring forth important stuff that I should be looking at.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.780]   And I think you do develop a relationship with those bloggers.
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:31.300]   I think ultimately, that's what RSS is all about, is the meta-meta where you create a
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:38.820]   page that is a list of links to other people's pages that you like who then link to a third
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.740]   level of pages that are possibly the original source.
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:46.260]   But more often, somebody's writing about a fourth layer, which is the original source.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.980]   So there is a lot of meta going on.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:52.380]   I'm very flattered you would mention Harrington's name in the same sentence.
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.900]   Oh, I love you, Steph Frank.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.660]   He is such a hard worker.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.300]   But I'm sure we all look at Techmem.com.
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.300]   He's written.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.300]   Techmeme is fantastic.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.660]   By the way, Mike is retiring briefly for a few months, I understand.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.500]   So just through that.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.140]   And Techmeme, I will look at and...
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.900]   That's a very good sight.
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.900]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.860]   I can't remember the editor's name, but he does have it set up such that you see the
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.700]   names of people who are commenting on the stories.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.620]   And I find myself looking at the headline and then looking to see Bing Bing Bing Bing,
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.900]   who's talking about it.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.020]   And in my mind, I will look for the...
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.900]   I begin to recognize authorities.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:31.900]   Right.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.100]   So that's something else Techmeme is doing for me.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.540]   It's not just showing me all the conversation.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.460]   It's also letting me pick and choose those people I think which have authority.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:45.900]   So I can get a number of sides of the story from people I've read previously and have
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.820]   some confidence in.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:49.820]   I like Techmeme.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:55.340]   These are ways of dealing with the overwhelming amount of content that you're swamped with
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:58.660]   on the internet.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:02.060]   Are you still in the metric in Andy or did we put you to sleep?
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.340]   I think we're staying out of the intellectual discourse.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:10.420]   Well, let me give you a couple of stories from Frank's blog just so we could talk about
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.420]   it.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.700]   "Hoffington Post" which is another very...
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:17.020]   I mean, if you're a political junkie, it's a must read.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.500]   Adriana's really done a good job with that side.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.860]   Because you agree with a lot of it or pisses you off.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.460]   Either way, it doesn't matter, right?
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.620]   You still have to read it.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:34.260]   They've hired a new political editor in DC and Frank notes that one of the things she's
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:40.140]   said recently is that she would like to have an online presidential debate.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.340]   Do you want to comment on that, Frank?
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:49.980]   She said she'd like to have an online presidential debate because as she thinks about the internet,
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:54.780]   there's no such thing as the 58 minute gate we've got to hit before the commercials come
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:58.580]   up and we've got to go back to the network and the show is over.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.580]   There's no limits.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:04.580]   I was thinking about millions and millions of potential, you know.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.580]   Oh no, let's not be cynical.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.580]   Come on.
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.100]   Oh my God, I'm good at cynical.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:09.100]   I like cynical.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.860]   I think it's great though for the body politic.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.060]   It gives you a much more direct connection.
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:18.620]   Why should I wait and see what Tim Russert's going to ask when I could ask that question
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:21.500]   or a better question myself of the candidates?
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.500]   We need a thing, Kennedy.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.500]   It's a go for it.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.500]   Everybody in it.
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.500]   Leo, that'll do it.
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.500]   No, that's a bad idea.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.500]   That was an American's genetic group.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:33.900]   I'd like to see a chat with each of the members and select group of voters.
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.140]   A town hall kind of thing.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:42.140]   Yeah, but an 18 year old and a 27 year old and somebody of different disenfranchised groups
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.140]   and disenfranchised as well.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:47.700]   Wasn't that the key to the success of the Howard Dean campaign whether it's real or
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.540]   not appearance of transparency and accessibility?
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:55.900]   Yeah, well, I mean, and here's a Canadians perspective.
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.300]   Here is Howard Dean was actually going out on limb in many ways way beyond what traditional
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.700]   what we've seen as traditional American politicians were doing.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.780]   And in the end, he expressed himself too much and got killed for it.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.260]   That's a good point.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:12.700]   I would really like to see more of that in not only in your politicians, but our politicians,
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.540]   which are like dry as dishwater.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:19.460]   I mean, oh my God, I mean, they need the internet desperately because otherwise nobody
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.740]   else is going to be below the age of 35 now is going to vote unless they're online.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:28.500]   You asked an important question though, Frank, would the candidates go for this?
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.460]   It's kind of scary for them.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:35.060]   Well, I'm sure we're going to see candidates pretending to have live chats with all voters
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.060]   out there.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.940]   But of course, the questions are going to go through a moderator.
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:44.740]   But I think it would be fascinating if you found John McCain and Hillary Clinton sitting
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:50.660]   down in their respective offices hooked up on a PC in a chat room.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.540]   It would be fascinating in real time.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.460]   I would love to see that.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.140]   Washington politics meets hot or not.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.940]   Well, you don't want to make it more of a, you don't want to make it more of a popularity
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:01.940]   contest.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.500]   What you want to do is get substantive and force them to get substantive.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.340]   Well, we're a democracy, Leo.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.900]   It is a popularity contest.
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.540]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.040]   Never mind.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.500]   But it's also, I mean, think about it this way.
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.260]   You talk about a strange transition.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:19.380]   You know, the Nixon, the Nixon, Kennedy debates and the influence of television and suddenly
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:24.060]   makeup and presentation on camera becomes this huge deciding factor in how the American
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.500]   people choose their next president.
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:30.300]   Well, I mean, somebody's got to be like, "Leats speak online and the ability to chat
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.420]   quickly in order to see," you know what I mean?
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.500]   But this is not the first time that's ever permitted.
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.740]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.740]   I think that's important.
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:41.860]   Look at, you know, Roosevelt was a success because he mastered a new medium instead of
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:46.860]   orating and, you know, essentially speaking to the back of the theater, he was able to
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.780]   do these intimate fireside chats.
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:52.700]   And his mastery of that new medium made him the success that he was.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.660]   I think Nixon learned a great lesson from the debates.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.300]   And Nixon was the first ad agency presidency.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:02.140]   I mean, he brought in people from ad agencies to manage his campaign.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.140]   He learned.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.500]   It's a issue called Mark Burnett.
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:10.180]   Mark Burnett could run a survivor-type election next time around.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.860]   I bet you you'd get a lot of it to voter turnout.
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:12.860]   I predict.
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:13.860]   I don't know if it'll be this election.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:17.420]   I don't know when it will be, but you will see the same kind of transition happening.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:22.940]   Or a candidate who can master the new medium, in this case, the internet, will have a significant
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.340]   advantage over all the rest of the guys because of this.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:30.940]   Well, I think that's already happened in the last two rounds of the last two major elections
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:32.140]   in the United States, Leo.
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:35.980]   And I mean, I'd be kind of curious to bring it back to the whole idea of huffing to wanting
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.820]   to do an online meeting.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.460]   She actually talking about, she's talking about video online, where she gets to be the
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:47.220]   center of the debate, or she actually talking about taking, you know, online participation
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:50.660]   by the candidates in some exciting new direction.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.020]   Patrick, I think it's the latter.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:58.980]   When I talked to Melinda, she was just thinking about the idea that because the internet is
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:05.860]   without restrictions on the quantity of content or the time that you might do it, I had the
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.940]   sense that she was thinking about something that was text-based.
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.740]   And Mayan, you know, could in fact last over days.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:18.140]   That she said, you know, with the internet, we can force them to answer the question.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:23.140]   So which is, all right, we send you a question, and here it is by email, answer it.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.140]   We didn't like that.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.340]   We're not going to post it.
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:30.220]   This is the question, answer the question, and it might become almost a debate in blog
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.220]   style.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:35.540]   Yeah, that would be really interesting because then you can get your speech writers and your
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:41.180]   policy people, and it would be a much more realistic impression because, you know, it's
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:46.700]   not like the president's, you know, the president can be extremely alone, I would imagine.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:50.700]   But for the most part, he's the figurehead for a large, talented group of people.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:53.060]   It's like postal chess versus chess over the board.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.660]   I mean, you have time to think about it.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.140]   You have time to research and come back with your best answer.
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.460]   And isn't that what we want?
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:03.340]   We're not looking for a leader who does well under the hot TV lights and looks good in
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.620]   makeup anymore, I would hope.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:10.620]   And of course, if you had a sense that there were people watching this and paying attention,
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:14.260]   that really puts the pressure on the candidate to come up with an answer.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:18.300]   You can't just kiss it off.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:25.300]   And I do believe that, you know, maybe candidates now will reject it, feel intimidated by it
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.900]   or threatened by it, but ultimately some candidates going to come forward and embrace it, and
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.540]   it will be the key to success.
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.940]   You think that George Bush did that, Patrick, and that's how he won the election?
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.580]   Well, I think how our dean took advantage of the internet.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:41.580]   Obviously.
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:44.820]   And I think both the Republican and Democratic parties were involved in heavy.
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:48.620]   I mean, from everything from Google bombing to, you know,
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.620]   Sure.
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:51.460]   And they let bloggers into the convention, I remember.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.020]   Yeah, the internet has already become a huge part of the process.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.020]   It'd be very no.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:59.460]   Patrick, who's heir apparent, I think, is Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:03.020]   I've been watching the way that he communicates to his constituents online.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:05.580]   And, you know, so this vote, Arnold.com, whatever he's got.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:09.100]   And he does it a very effective use of the internet.
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.100]   Fortunately.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:14.540]   Unfortunately, the Constitution prohibits him from the time being, but you know, nothing
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.940]   that an evote can't figure out online call.
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:18.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:19.940]   Speaking of evos.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.140]   Well, Patrick, Howard Dean may have mastered the internet.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.180]   Patrick Howard Dean may have mastered the internet.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.140]   Unfortunately, he didn't master TV.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.340]   Oh, that's all we have to say.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.940]   No, but that's what I'm going to give her a must.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:34.220]   So yeah, that was, you know, hey, if you're going to blow up, you may as well blow up
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:35.780]   to you while the cameras are rolling.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:36.780]   And he's still around.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.460]   And who's running the Democratic National Committee?
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:44.420]   Oh, I think you know, I think in some ways that's an acknowledgement from the Democrats
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.540]   that Howard knew something.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.440]   And let's see if we can use that organizational skill or at least Howard was awake and moving
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.440]   forward.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.440]   Well, that's it.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.840]   Speaking of evi machines, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US has released
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:03.260]   a report recommending that touchscreen electronic voting machines be decertified.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.980]   Damn skippy.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:05.980]   Yay.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.760]   Ohio says.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.640]   We're getting rid of them.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.360]   There have been all sorts of problems with them.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:18.840]   And in fact, what the NIST is saying is if you can't have a verifiable, a voter verifiable
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:24.760]   paper trail, they call it a VV pat, then the then electronic voting machine should not
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.120]   be certified for use in election.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.400]   This is what experts have been saying.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.040]   Well, they said on the screensavers, Patrick, four years ago, we've been saying this for a
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   long time.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.400]   Look, I got a question for you guys.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:39.360]   If we can run our banking on a machine, if an ATM can keep track of our finances and
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.040]   not make mistakes and calculate to the like a hundredth of a cent, how can we can't come
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.320]   up with a voting machine that works?
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.160]   There's a lot more at stake in a voting machine.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.160]   That's what's going on.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.560]   No, I already got to give you the reason.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:51.840]   I'd argue there's billions and billions of dollars at stake with ATMs and voting is just
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.160]   about a guy in a suit.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.840]   Well, this is a good question.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   Somebody asked me that.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.840]   Can't we write software?
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.840]   This software isn't that complicated.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.320]   Can't we write verifiable software that works?
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.280]   The problem is the way that the elections are administrated at a regional level versus
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.080]   basically needing a national standard that doesn't suck.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:14.200]   There's a reason there's 4200 different ways to vote in the United States.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.120]   The idea of like, yeah, I think there should be a way to have an open source or verifiable
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.640]   or whatever.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:25.040]   Yeah, if we can bank without losing it on a daily basis, surely we can figure out how
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040]   to vote.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.440]   It's not the state of Ohio, by the way, I want to clarify.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.760]   It's Cuyahoga County in Ohio that is considering abandoning its electronic machines.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.440]   They had a lot of troubles in the last election.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.720]   It's a tough county burning rivers, phogomissions, problems.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.000]   Is that the Cleveland, the county where Cleveland is?
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.520]   It's the Kailort River.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.720]   Did it catch on fire too?
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.360]   Well, I'll tell you.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.860]   It's tough.
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.440]   Let me see if there's, we got to run because we're running out of time here, but just a
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.200]   couple of other stories before we bail out.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.960]   AMD and Nvidia both are targeted in antitrust investigations.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960]   Why?
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.840]   It has to do with, I think it has to do with chip dumping or collusion and memory chips
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:11.440]   called DRAMs, apparently a RAM price collusion.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.640]   This has been actually a problem all over the place.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.400]   A number of other companies have been subpoenaed.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:22.840]   I don't know if it means anything, just bringing it up.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840]   Let's see.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.640]   And we all go down all the people.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.920]   Well, no, it's not much to say.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.920]   I mean, you know, I don't want nobody wants to say, well, they're guilty.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.480]   They're, they throw them again.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.960]   We don't know what this is.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.680]   I might be a side.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.680]   It's outrageous.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.680]   Outrageous.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.760]   Well, the question is, are they holding the prices up or that they dump it and lower the
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   price of memory?
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.520]   And if they did dump it and lower the price of memory, I'm not sure I have a problem
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.920]   with that.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.000]   In the past, these investigations have been whether the prices have been propped up by
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   collusion.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   Okay.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   Thank you.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.880]   In 2002, Dell complained about DRAM prices, which in fact, prompted a probe that, at
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.720]   end up in $700 million in fines and a number of jail sentences.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   So I think that's the issue.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.720]   And it probably is kind of like Dell that are complaining saying, Hey, you know, who's,
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.360]   why are you all charging the same price?
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.720]   Why is it so expensive?
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720]   Let's see.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.760]   And what does Brittany Spears think about that?
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.760]   Interesting.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.520]   You know, she broke up with KFED using text messaging.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520]   So good for her.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.520]   See, that's the new, this new melody in that relationship.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.400]   Actually, I think it was because KFED kept blowing her off on dinner dates.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.360]   So she finally had to text him and say, she texted him.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.360]   See a feather line.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.000]   I think we should, we should vote via SMS.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.320]   You know, we have, uh, you know, touching that one, Andy.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.760]   You know, they will in Great Britain.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.680]   They love text messaging in Great Britain.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680]   I don't know why.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.680]   They just love it.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.200]   Because, because you win Mars bars and stuff like that, they, they, they, they, all their
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.600]   marketing campaigns like text now and you win a chocolate bar.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.480]   Oh, Lord, I know I'm talking with my, how do I get it?
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:03.040]   It's, it's, you as companies as of, uh, as of, let's see, last Friday are now going to
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.480]   be required to keep track of all, get this, all email, instant messages and other electronic
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.960]   documents generated by their employees.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.080]   And I never sent an email at work again.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.000]   Better not live in Canada.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   God save Canada.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   Better not.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.240]   Uh, it's, uh, all electronically stored information.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.800]   Is that corporate personal or anything?
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.600]   This is like socks.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.080]   This is another Sarbanes Oxley kind of a rule under the new rules and information technology
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.920]   employee who routinely copies over a backup computer tape could be committing the equivalent
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.680]   of virtual shredding.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.840]   There are hundreds of e-discovery vendors.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840]   Oh boy.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:45.160]   Somebody making money on this, uh, 1.6 billion dollar business last year.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.040]   It's going to get a lot bigger next year.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.440]   I don't, I don't know that I have that big a problem with this.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.080]   I mean, having, maybe it's because my wife's working at the EPA and you find out people
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.240]   do fascinating things with, you know, incredibly valuable pieces of information at large corporations
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.520]   when things go horribly desperately wrong.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520]   Oh yeah.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520]   Absolutely.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.440]   Um, you, you want to keep, keep this, uh, information that courts are requiring it.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.720]   Now federal regulations require it.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.440]   It's more work for IT people.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.800]   Yeah, but it's also something you should keep in mind if you're sending a text message
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.680]   breaking up with your boyfriend on the corporate network.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.120]   It lives forever.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.880]   This might save the zip drive and bring it back.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.480]   Back at by Max Stor and Seagate's stock now.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.520]   But your honor, it was the click of death.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.520]   It wasn't me.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.520]   It was the click of death.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.920]   Hey, I want to wrap up with something that is actually not such a happy story.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:38.320]   Uh, a good friend of ours, uh, and Patrick and I are, uh, just kind of ripped up about
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.320]   this.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.360]   Uh, James Kim and his family have gone missing.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.920]   Now we're recording this on Friday.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:50.120]   Uh, so, uh, I am praying and hoping that by the time you hear this, they will have been
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.680]   found.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.960]   But if not, I just kind of want to put the word out.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   You may remember James Kim.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.800]   He was a lab analyst at tech TV.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.040]   Worked with you, Patrick, very closely.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.040]   I know.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.480]   I actually hired him into the lab and worked with him when he first started at tech TV.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.720]   It's, it's a mystery.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.640]   I'm hoping it's going to have a happy ending.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.320]   They were up visiting family on Thanksgiving.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:19.760]   We're driving from Portland, Oregon, uh, to, um, kind of a remote coastal area.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:25.040]   Beach, Gold Beach, um, and went missing in the last, we're heard from on Saturday, November
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040]   25th.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:31.480]   Uh, as we speak, uh, there's a land search going on in that area.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.280]   They had helicopters out all afternoon.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:40.000]   Um, if you know anything, uh, if you go to twit.tv, we have, uh, more information, pictures,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.080]   uh, links and a phone number for the San Francisco police department.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:53.080]   Uh, there is also a Pacific Northwest call center, 1-800-4527-8888.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.320]   And, um, well, it's just a, just a shocker, frankly.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:02.280]   And I just, I hope that they decided to visit Paris or something and just forgot to tell
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.560]   anybody, but when James didn't show up for work earlier this week, uh, the, the word
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.240]   went out and we haven't heard a thing.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.080]   So, uh, it, James is a great guy.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.280]   I just love James.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.000]   And, uh, and, uh, well, I remember.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.480]   Many times I call for up seeing pictures of his beautiful children.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.040]   Uh, the whole family is missing.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.840]   So we don't know what happened.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:27.280]   Let's hope by the time this airs, they will have been discovered and if they are, I tell
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:32.120]   you, I will edit this all out and I will be jumping for joy.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   Frank Barnico, we thank you so much for joining us.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.120]   Frank is at market.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.280]   Watch his blog is blog as at blog.marketwatch.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.000]   Is it blogs or blog?
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   That market.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   Uh, blogs.marketwatch.com/barnico.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   B-A-R-A-R.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   Or barnico.com.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Oh, that's easier.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   I redirect that one.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.400]   Let's just go to barnico.com.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.560]   Let's all go to barnico.com.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.440]   So glad we could have you on Frank.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.440]   Uh, great plug.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.440]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.800]   And I want to thank you for saying at one point, I think you were quoting somebody
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.440]   else that we should be making a million dollars a year from your mouth to God's ear, from
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.080]   your blog to God's ear, Frank.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.840]   Well, you're the hardest working guy I know.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.440]   How many podcasts do you have now?
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.720]   We have 16 on the network.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.040]   We're adding a 17th any day now.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.840]   I'm not at all of them only on the night.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.560]   I'm waiting to hear the boom when your head explodes.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.480]   What happened a long time ago, Patrick?
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.080]   How long, long time ago?
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.120]   Patrick Norton is one of the hardest working men in showbiz.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.560]   So I have to say that.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   A dl.tv.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.520]   That's where he does his show dl.tv with Robert Herron.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.000]   And of course, Cranky Geeks is also part of the dl.tv network.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.040]   Are we a network now?
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.200]   I think with two shows, that's a network.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.920]   Two shows and multiple video releases a week.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920]   What a serious talk.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920]   Yeah, you guys work hard.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.920]   This is how CBS started.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.600]   You know, I often think that we are in Frank, you cover this more than anybody.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.480]   I don't you think we're kind of in the beginning of something?
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.720]   Yes, there are folks like you.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.440]   There's no one like you, but there are folks out there with a string of shows, either along
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.040]   a theme or just trying to amass and aggregate themselves.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.640]   So think of yourself, Leo, as a podcast curator.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   I don't know.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   Yeah, maybe that's what it is.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.800]   Maybe that's what it is.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.360]   Andy Walker, it's so great to talk to you.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.960]   You want to talk a little bit about Little Geeks?
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.360]   Yeah, thank you, Leo.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.800]   This is the latest thing that's making my heart also warm.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.800]   In fact, it gets me out of bed in the morning.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:34.960]   It's a project called Little Geeks, and the idea is we're gathering computers from the
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.480]   community, from companies and people's basements, referring them and giving them to underprivileged
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.680]   children here in Toronto.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:45.320]   We have a pilot project right now, and then once we get through that, we're going to be
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.760]   starting to expand out across other cities in Canada and, of course, into the States
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:49.760]   as well.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.120]   My friends at TechSmith have said that they're going to support our first chapter in the
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.080]   US and Lansing, Michigan, next year, so I'm very, very proud of them.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.080]   You can learn more about LittleGeeks.org.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:05.480]   And of course, LabRats.tv is Andy Zavidio, great podcast he does with Shankar.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.480]   It's wonderful.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.480]   And his two cats, Boo and Biff.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.280]   You hear me out in the background?
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.800]   They're jumping a little over the couch.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.560]   They're in the show too, and LabRats is pretty funny.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.560]   They actually get fan mail.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.560]   It's quite hilarious.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.240]   It's a good thing Amber's not here because she just hates those cats.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.720]   And she loves you.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:23.720]   It's the cats.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.600]   She's a little allergic to it.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.680]   She's coming over tomorrow to cater for my party.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.760]   So I think we're going to lock the cats away.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.760]   I think you're better.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.000]   I think you're better.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   All right.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.440]   Andy, great to talk to you.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:39.920]   Again, our thoughts and prayers are with James Kim and his family right now.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.640]   Just some prayers coming out from the Twitter army would really help.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   We'll see you next time.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.440]   Another tweet this week in Tech.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:47.980]   He's in the can.
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:10:00.980]   As always, this week in Tech is brought to you by the good folks at Dell.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.660]   We do thank him so much for making this possible.
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:07.420]   If you are in the market for a new PC, maybe you want to get ready for Vista.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.540]   That's what I did.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:12.100]   I bought a Dell M1210 notebook.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.100]   Wow.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.100]   Beautiful.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.100]   Ford Duo.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.100]   I loaded it up.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.100]   Two gigs of RAM.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:18.100]   It's got this.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.980]   It's 7200 RPM brass.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.980]   It's a little smaller.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:26.740]   I wanted the speed and of course that video graphics should be a beautiful computer for
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:27.740]   Vista.
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:28.740]   I can't wait to install it.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.260]   That's one of my picks, but I have several more on the Leo's picks page.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:34.820]   I encourage you to visit anything you buy through that page, even if it's not one of
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.820]   my picks.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.820]   We can benefit to it.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.820]   So we thank you for your support.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:46.820]   Go to tech.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:49.540]   Tech.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.100]   Tech.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:54.580]   My friends, my tweets, are you ready?
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.580]   Yeah, the Twitter army.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:08.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
