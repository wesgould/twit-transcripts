[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.640]   An obsessive detail joining me.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.520]   Now I'm so happy to have from Bloomberg Business Week
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.800]   in their global coverage, Mark Million.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.840]   Great to have you back.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.760]   Oh, it's good to be here, especially right before Christmas
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.120]   time.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.560]   Yeah, this is our last show before Christmas.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.520]   Yeah, it's exciting.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.760]   On the longest night of the year, the shortest day.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.960]   It's winter solstice today.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.280]   I hope you enjoy it.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.320]   Also, Nathan Oliveira's Giles from Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.120]   Nice to have you, Nathan.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.760]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.600]   Can I call you Nate?
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.480]   Yeah, thank you, Nate.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.560]   You like that.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.240]   Brought some wine.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.080]   Oh, no, this is from Mark.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.280]   Thank you, Mark.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.680]   It's very nice.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.440]   You got it.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.200]   Look, by the way, he's man spreading.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.400]   On the ramble.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   For a total of men's spritz.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.720]   For a couple, the guy who invented man spreading.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.920]   Do we have to explain that for the viewers who might not
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.680]   know what that is?
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.320]   Yeah, if you're just joining us, you'll understand later.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.360]   And Tank Girls here.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.840]   Miriam Jwar, great to see you once again.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.080]   Welcome back.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.440]   Yep.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.720]   She's still looking for work.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.280]   Yeah, I'm still looking for a full-time gig.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.080]   But I did manage to squeeze something out of my hard working
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.000]   days here.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.360]   This thing called the crowded rocket.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.160]   I don't know if you heard about it.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.960]   What's that?
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.720]   It's a new crowdfunding platform that I help launch.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.480]   It's kind of crazy.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.560]   It's a very soft launch.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   It's kind of like that scene in Star Wars
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.040]   where they're trying to restart the hyperdrive
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.080]   and the Millennium Falcon.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.560]   It's exactly the sound that crowded rocket is making right now.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.080]   Exactly.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.480]   But the idea is to make a boutique site that only handpicks
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.600]   and vets and curates a few campaigns
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.280]   and holds their hands all the way along and then puts them
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.920]   together with VCs at the end if they're successful.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.360]   So we'll see how it does.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.920]   But you know, I'm obviously not putting all my eggs in one
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.400]   basket here.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.720]   It's a bit of a side project, as it were.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.200]   Last time you were here, you talked about Flux,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.280]   a 3D printer, which is since--
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.160]   let me go to Kickstarter.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.800]   It's graduated quite well.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   $1.6 million, they were asking for $100,000.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.840]   I'm not surprised.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.600]   It's a pretty cool all-in-one 3D printer laser engraver,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.120]   3D modeler, and auto pen.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   Actually, because you reach the stretch goals of $900,000,
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.880]   there's a pen holder module.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.240]   There's a gyroscope.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.880]   There's Wi-Fi.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   Wow.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.560]   So we were talking before the show, and you pointed out,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.440]   this is hard, because especially when you're
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.800]   a big success like this, and I can
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.520]   think of a few examples on Kickstarter,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.120]   the pressure's on now.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.200]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.120]   I mean, when you talk to the folks at Pebble,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.280]   when they reached that insane amount, $10.3 million,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.920]   they were like, oh, crap.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.160]   What do we do now?
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.720]   We have to find a way to make this happen for not 1,000 watches,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.600]   but 90 something 1,000 watches.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.120]   Wow.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.320]   And they sure did.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.040]   But a lot of people don't understand that.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.400]   Like, I just got my InstaCube.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.040]   Are you familiar with the InstaCube story on Kickstarter?
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.200]   No, tell me about that.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.920]   We should mention, by the way, Miriam
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.960]   used to work for Pebble, so it has some direct experience.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.680]   Yeah, I worked at Pebble, and most importantly,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.480]   I worked at Engadget for many years before that.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.200]   So that's probably how you guys know me all.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.840]   But InstaCube was this picture frame
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.640]   that shows your Instagram feed, and you can like stuff.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.640]   Oh, I like that.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.480]   By typing a button on top.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.720]   And it's wireless, so you don't put it on a shelf,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.480]   or hang it on a wall.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.760]   It lasts a really long time, because it's not, you know,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.520]   it's got a big battery.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.240]   It was two years ago on that.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.920]   It was epic.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.760]   Like, I pledged my $99 for it, and I finally just received it
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.120]   in the mail two days ago.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.640]   Wow.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   And the thing about it is that it looked forever
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.480]   like they were going to completely fall flat on their faces.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.680]   Like, I had given up about a year and a half ago on these guys,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.360]   because they were so bad.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.680]   Like, it was such a disaster in terms of their communication
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.720]   with their backers.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.320]   But it just goes to show it's really challenging.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.840]   And they did manage to pull through.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.960]   So you just really never know.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.880]   The thing I think you have to do with crowdfunding is if you think
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.080]   of it as you're making a donation to kind of help a bunch of people.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080]   It's not a store.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.560]   It's not a store.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   Kickstart even says this.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.680]   We're not going to get something out of it, or not,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.120]   is a completely different ballgame, right?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.840]   What's the dumbest thing, Mark Millen, you've ever ever crowd's funded?
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.440]   Have you fallen for this trap?
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.800]   I got so frustrated with the experience.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.440]   I did a number of features for it about how terrible this--
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.000]   I mean, it's kind of a scam, because these people with no experience
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.360]   in the field go out and raise a ton of money,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.400]   and then have no idea how to deliver.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.640]   So the dumbest one was I spent $50 on this device that has a timer
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.800]   and is also a tea infuser.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.160]   That is a cool thing.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.320]   I would buy it like Walmart.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.560]   And that was three years ago, and I never made it.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.520]   And finally, just a couple months ago, he agreed to refund everybody on Squares.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.200]   Wow.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.680]   That's got to hurt.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.920]   I got my Pono player.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.120]   I just got that.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.520]   Still waiting for the Temperfect mug, a mug that holds coffee and tea
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.200]   at the perfect temperature.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.840]   These rings are blown up.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.200]   I noticed there was also a ring on that crowd rocket website.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.920]   I was talking about the one--
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   The ringly one.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.400]   The gesture wing.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.840]   Come on.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.680]   That is--
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.960]   That's a little silly.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.360]   But the wearable sensors that will light up when you get a text message
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.480]   or an email or something, those are gaining traction.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.640]   Ringly is the big one.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.120]   Ringly is the big one.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.480]   So the one on Crowded Rock is a mood ring.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.360]   It just senses your emotions and gives you feedback.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.280]   So you can track how you're doing and change your behavior, hopefully, to be happier.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.480]   It's kind of an interesting idea.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.160]   But you bring up a good point.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.600]   You both do bring up a good point about crowd funding.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.120]   And that's kind of what the friends and I started Crowded Rock
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.040]   at to do, right?
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.000]   Robert Scobles on board, you'll be Benjamin, Julie M. Blaine,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.680]   a bunch of really hard hitters.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.160]   Because we believe that vetting and curating is the way to go.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.280]   Because you can't--
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.880]   And especially if you eventually need the help from VCs to carry on.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.160]   It's like you can't just have potato salad.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.960]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.400]   But I think people expect a little more from crowd funding as it's growing up.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.760]   Did you see what potato salad is?
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.560]   A crowd-funded project?
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   Potato salad?
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.760]   I'll make some really good potatoes salad.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.560]   And you raised thousands of dollars.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.760]   Amazing.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   This one I bid on, but I didn't get it.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.120]   The Space Folk album, he was going to record an album on the moon.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.560]   He needed $21 million.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.920]   So my $1,000 pledge didn't really help much.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.520]   In fact, they didn't end up funding.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   It's a great idea.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.120]   What's the dumbest thing you ever crowd-funded, Nator?
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.240]   Are you immune to this?
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.240]   You know what?
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.520]   I actually don't buy into this kind of BS too often.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.400]   Most of what I've funded are like comic books on Kickstarter.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   Yeah, you can't go wrong there.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   I'm a big comic book fan.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   There's artists that I actually know and support.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.480]   I did support Uya.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.200]   Yeah, and you got one?
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.880]   No, I actually didn't get my Uya in, but it was kind of a mess.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.720]   It turned out it wasn't very good, so who cares?
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.000]   Well, yeah, I guess I really didn't miss out on that.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   But for the most part, I mean like--
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Never got it.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.520]   You funded Uya and you never got one?
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.400]   So when I went through the process, maybe I did it wrong, or maybe Kickstarter got it
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   wrong, or Amazon got it wrong.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.400]   I think it's your fault.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.640]   I was the wrong tier, so I gave them enough to get the hardware.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   But because I didn't do the right tier, to check the right box or something like that,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.320]   I actually talked with Julie.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.680]   She emailed me directly and was like, "No, you're not going to get a console."
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.280]   It was kind of a bummer, but thanks for the money.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.280]   Appreciate that.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.360]   And I did get my username, which I've never used because I've never actually played on
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   Uya.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.520]   All right, this is from the summer for anyone who missed the Kickstarter Potato Salad by
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.760]   Zach Danger Brown in Clums Ohio.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.760]   How could Kickstarter let that happen?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.760]   About this project.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.960]   Basically, I'm just making Potato Salad.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.160]   I haven't decided what kind yet.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.640]   6,900 people contributed a total of $55,000.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   What?
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   What?
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.640]   I love it.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.640]   I love it.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.640]   What?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   I love it.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   I love it.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   I love it.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640]   I love it.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   I love that.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.720]   And he's not committed to do anything but make some Potato Salad and eat it?
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.960]   Well, you can participate.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.440]   If you pledge $3 or more, you receive a bite of Potato Salad.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.360]   A photo of Zach Danger Brown making the Potato Salad.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.280]   Don't mail me Potato Salad, please.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   And a thank you note.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   I love it.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   But you know what?
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280]   This is an example, Miriam, isn't it?
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.360]   Because now this guy's got to make a lot of Potato Salad.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   I'm fired on him.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.520]   But it's also a little bit of commentary.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.720]   It's a little social commentary on where we're at right now.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   It's absurd and it's stupid as many of these projects are.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480]   And yet it got funny.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.600]   It reminds me of the cards against humanity guys on Black Friday.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.560]   They pulled all their products and sold a piece of poop in a box for like six bucks.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.160]   It sold out of the poop in a box.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.520]   And it was more than $30,000 something made.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.120]   I'm finally too old.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.360]   And they actually mailed people pieces of...
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.320]   I knew there would come a time where I would just, as all people do and generationally,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   get to a time where you just don't understand the world anymore.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.440]   You've jumped the shark Leo.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   And it's over.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.680]   You've jumped the shark Leo.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   That's it.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   It's over.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   I give up.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.680]   But no, but seriously, did you watch the unboxing video of the...
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   It's amazing.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.680]   I'll put it in the end.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.080]   They got to open to see if there was something inside with their bare hands.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.720]   Yeah, that was just dirty.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   That was just nasty.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720]   I can't do that.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   Well, I'm not going to show that then.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.960]   The guy was trying poop.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   He cracks his lips.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   Oh, good.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   Bad news, man.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.520]   Bad news.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.240]   If I Google poop unboxing, I'm going to probably find it, aren't I?
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.440]   I think you should go cards against humanity.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.280]   There might be other...
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.780]   No, no.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.720]   Perez Hilton has it, but here's the unbox.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.080]   And of course, where would it be but Dig?
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.800]   That's the biggest report.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   Dig is good.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.240]   I'm not going to show this video.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.720]   Don't show this video, Anthony.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   Oh, come on.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   We have standards.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.360]   We have broadcast standards here.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360]   All right.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   First, there's an ad.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   So we got to skip the ad.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.360]   Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   Oh, I...
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.840]   I see the closing and I click the ad.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   Nice going.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.680]   Nice, smart person.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.000]   Don't you know how YouTube works?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   No, I don't.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.480]   I'm going to the home now.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.800]   All right, here it is.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.240]   This was sold by how much by cards against...
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.480]   I think it was like six bucks.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.360]   But they sold thousands of them.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   Yeah, it was six...
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   Eight dollars?
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   I think it was...
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.720]   Oh, and pay eight dollars for a piece of poop in the box.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.880]   At least there'd be an upfront about what you're buying, right?
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.240]   I mean, unlike so many of these Kickstarter products that never deliver on there.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.880]   We could do like three girls in a cup, except we're just going to react to poop in a box.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.560]   It's not that terrifying.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   Nothing's happening.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.120]   But how adorable is that a little talking?
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   Again, I don't really understand how YouTube works.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120]   The narrator is pretty funny, actually.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   The narrator is pretty funny, actually.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.520]   Will he do something ever, actually?
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.320]   Oh, would turn up the USN?
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   Is my...
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   Here's like a...
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   That's a smiley little logo.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   You're like, you can't be mad at that.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   Well, that's an emoji.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   Oh.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   There's the box.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   Oh, boy.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   It's still both.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:03.560]   So cards against humanity is actually a very weird but good card game of like...
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.800]   It's kind of like apples to apples.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.200]   Apples to apples with just bad words.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   Bad words.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   It's fun.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   Lots of fun.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.840]   Somebody played it on our air once and I hit the roof, but then I realized it's okay.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.840]   Box made in China.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.440]   Poop made in America.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.880]   Where did they get this poop?
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.560]   When the FDA kind of have rules against mailing poop, isn't there any...
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.560]   Well, the humanity.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.280]   First, Craig Ferguson is fired.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   Then this...
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.960]   I don't know why I bought this.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.920]   Thousands of people are saying that right now.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   You know why?
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.160]   Because they didn't believe that it really was true.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.960]   Oh, help me.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.720]   And with his bare heads, why didn't someone like give him some napkins?
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.440]   Because he didn't believe it.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.040]   Nobody at all alone believed that this would actually be poop in a box.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.800]   It is!
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.120]   I think this is the fastest the show has ever devolved.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   Oh, God.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   I don't think he's talking about a real story yet.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   I thought he is.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.120]   Get stopped.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   Go away.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   Go away.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120]   No.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.120]   He breaks it in half, too.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   He does break it in half.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   I apologize for bringing that up, guys.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.520]   It's your fault, Nate.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.360]   The worst show ever.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   All my fault.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.840]   It seems like there will be rules against that.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   You think so.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.600]   But maybe not.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.840]   And I think people bought it because they couldn't believe it.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.280]   Well, it was like a form of Black Friday protests.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.600]   Like you buy so much, you know, crap, crap, poop, whatever.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.280]   Anyways, that here they're actually going to sell it to you and it was a big hit.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.080]   You know, I don't know.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   Yep.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.640]   Okay, so I was a little worried because here we are.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.840]   This time of year, usually there's no news at all.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.360]   We're talking about poop.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.720]   I shouldn't have been worried.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.880]   Actually, the Big Sony story continues to evolve and we're talking about that.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.200]   And I want to get-- look, we got experts here.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.160]   Speaking of poop, I am calling bull poop on this notion that this is the North Korean
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.160]   hack.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.360]   But maybe Mark Millian knows better.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.840]   All right, we're going to find out in just a bit.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.120]   Let's take a break and then we'll come back and talk about that.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:18.480]   But first a word from our sponsors.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.240]   What we sell is actually that bad.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.480]   So I feel good about that.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.760]   That's a low bar.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.480]   All right, sure, they brought you by the good folks at audible.com.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.200]   The best place to get audio books.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:40.520]   I know because I've been an audible subscriber now since 2000, maybe 2001.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:46.760]   I used to have a horrific commute, as you many of you know, at least two hours a day.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.400]   It was just a nightmare until I realized, hey, I can actually get some reading done with
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.880]   audio books from audible.com.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.440]   Audible is fantastic.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.800]   I want you to visit audible.com and browse around.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.280]   I could just show you.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:06.640]   The Audible app, by the way, on Android and iOS, Windows, Phone and Windows is just great.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.080]   I'm using it on Android here.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.440]   And I can even-- just in case some of you so, Leo, you don't really listen to audible.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.040]   This is my library on my device.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.960]   I've got TuneIn, The History of the Beatles.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   This is going to be amazing.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.600]   Three volume, like the best Dracula, which is amazing.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   Dramatized.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.440]   Alan Cumming is in this.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.720]   Tim Curry.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.080]   This is the new Peter F. Hamilton.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   I love him.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.320]   The Abyss Beyond Dreams.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320]   Love his stuff.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.040]   David Byrne of The Talking Heads wrote a book that is perhaps one of the most interesting
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.600]   and insightful books I've ever read about music, how music works.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   He talks not only about the Talking Heads, but it's less of a memoir and more about
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.000]   why music is the way it is.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   My pop music is the way it is.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Fascinating.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.680]   Thinking fast and slow, that's about economics.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.680]   Gone, girl.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.200]   I still haven't seen the movie, so I'm going to read the novel and find out how it ends.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.320]   This is a history of Manhattan, Dutch Manhattan, the island, it's the center of the world.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.600]   So you can see I alternate fiction and nonfiction.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.920]   I really like to do a little bit of both.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.040]   This is just a sampling of-- and these are all books I'm in the middle of right now.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.000]   This is a bad habit.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.600]   Audible.com.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   How about this?
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.320]   Scrum, the art of doing twice the work in half the time.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.160]   Yeah, you've never done a scrum if you think that's true.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   Let's see.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.320]   Neil Young's new book, Waging Heavy Peace.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.680]   That's on my list to read.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.200]   I love reading The Rock and Roll Biographies.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.520]   A lot of those now lately.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.560]   I want you to go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.320]   You'll be signing up for the platinum plan.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.840]   That's two books a month.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.400]   As you can see for me, that's barely enough.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.320]   Probably be enough for most people.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   The first month is free.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.320]   First two books are free.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.720]   And you get to keep them even if you cancel in the first 30 days and pay nothing.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:52.280]   You'll also get the daily digest of the New York Times of the Wall Street Journal, audible.com/twit2.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.440]   The best audiobooks read by the best readers ever.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.760]   And now's the chance for you to try it.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.560]   Amy Poehler reading her new memoir, Yes, Please.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.080]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:15.160]   One of the things that I have a kind of audible Jones and one of the things I kind of do by
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.000]   as you can see is I just doubt, I say, "Oh, I got to get that.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.680]   Oh, I got to get that."
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.800]   Every month I get two more books.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   I love it.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.320]   Why don't you join in the fun.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.720]   Sony Pictures Entertainment.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.960]   I heard a little agreement, Maryam, when I said, "So the President of the United States
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:42.840]   of America, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and unnamed federal authorities have told
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:51.160]   CNN, the journal, I think, many reliable news sources, the New York Times, that probably
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.560]   Bloomberg Business Week, that they think it was North Korea.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:02.400]   Meanwhile, everybody who knows anything about security is going, "It can't be North Korea."
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.880]   Maryam, you agree with me?
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   It seems improbable.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.280]   I was at the Venture Beat Holiday party earlier this week, and I was talking to a bunch of
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.040]   reporters there, and the consensus seems to be that it's potentially an inside job with
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.000]   somebody that was disgruntled with all the layoffs at Sony.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.680]   That's what it sounds like to me.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:27.320]   But now, of course, maybe our government is trying to find an excuse to put the hammer
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   down on North Korea.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.640]   See, that's my question.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.320]   Why would the FBI, why would Obama, why would they lie?
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.200]   Why would they say it's North Korea?
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.120]   The FBI says, "We have evidence we're not telling you that confirms this."
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.000]   The New York Times reported that North Korea is centrally involved in the hack citing unnamed
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.640]   U.S. officials.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.520]   As we all know, with these kinds of hacks, it's very difficult to know who did this stuff.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.000]   The FBI is saying, "Well, we recognize the code from previous North Korea attacks.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.800]   The code calls home to IP addresses that we've seen before from North Korea."
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.920]   And yet, I feel like this just doesn't smell right.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.280]   They're allowed to have IP addresses in North Korea.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.440]   I thought that was illegal.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.440]   Well, that's what's also interesting.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440]   It's like the government.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   They've thought the government forbid the Internet.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.440]   I'm just kidding.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.280]   All traffic to North Korea goes through China.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   Right.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.560]   They're not far wrong, Miriam, because I was watching an interview with a fascinating
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.560]   interview.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.560]   It was on The Daily Show.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.000]   I've got to see the documentary.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.600]   A young woman who went to North Korea to teach English and lived there for a while.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.760]   And she was there in a period of time in which she was teaching kids or new kids from their
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.880]   technical school in North Korea.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.120]   And they didn't have Internet at the time.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.760]   This was just a couple of years ago.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.520]   They literally were being taught computer science without the Internet.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.440]   It didn't exist.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.560]   I find this hard to believe, especially since this attack also looks like a typical attack
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.840]   from a amateurish hacker.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   Right?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:18.360]   I mean, they've drawn parallels between this hack and previous ones.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.840]   They used some of the same code, some of the same methods.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.480]   There was a hack.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:32.120]   I think it was last year on some South Korean banks, which the FBI cited in their statement.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.400]   This hack was well known.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.680]   I'm not sure that we knew that it was North Korea behind it, but the FBI in their statement
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.240]   said last year's hack of the South Korean banks was by North Korea, and this looks very
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   similar.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   Right.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   North Korea does have Internet.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.440]   In fact, they have an elite core of hackers, supposedly.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.440]   They do.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.880]   They have a government division that specializes in hacking.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:05.280]   North Korea also has a number of expats who don't reside in North Korea, but they still
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.920]   carry out missions and hackings and all that on the government's behalf.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.320]   But from outside of North Korea.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:20.360]   There's this famous activist in South Korea who escaped North Korea, and his thing is
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:28.720]   to try to deliver pamphlets by balloon into North Korea to try to educate the people there.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.920]   The idea is to send the balloons, and then they pop over North Korea, and the pamphlets
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.720]   fall down, and people read about information they would have never been able to get.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:45.600]   North Korea had sent someone to South Korea to try to assassinate them.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.280]   That was just one example of how North Korea is not just confined to North Korea.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:56.720]   We reported that the Sony breach, some of it was executed from a hotel in Thailand.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.160]   So it's entirely possible that they had an operative in Thailand who was carrying something
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.160]   that's out.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160]   But how?
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   I think it's always suspicious.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   When I hear, knowing how hackers work, that something originated somewhere, it's very
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.080]   hard to really know where an attack originates from.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.080]   Technically, I mean, it's extremely difficult.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   Just think the opposite.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.080]   Multiple servers.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   Exactly.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.720]   A good hacker is going to, if obfuscate the, it shouldn't be like, oh yeah, that's coming
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.880]   from a hotel in Thailand.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.840]   That seems, I don't know.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.200]   I'm just some guy.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.720]   I'm just in a schlub.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.320]   Of course, the FBI wouldn't lie to us, and the president wouldn't lie.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.760]   The FBI wouldn't lie to us.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   Yes.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.360]   If you rely solely on where the IP was coming from, then that's not a good way to investigate.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:51.160]   But they looked at a number, this hack used six components from previously known hacks.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.880]   And the South Korean bank example was one where the FBI said, we knew this one was North
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   Korea.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.360]   And a lot of the code looks the same.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.760]   So I mean, that's not damning evidence that the FBI claims they have more.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.320]   North Korea denies it, but they said, we're glad to help you investigate.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.080]   And supposedly China's helping, or the US is talking to China about maybe...
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.000]   Well they should, because they have all these traffic has to have.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.080]   If it's coming out of North Korea anyway, it has to go through China.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.800]   But I mean, this is all kind of...
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.680]   There have been a lot of criticisms over these methods saying that they're very simplistic,
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.240]   that they're not very sophisticated, and that could kind of prove that North Korea isn't
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   behind it.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.600]   But at the same time, the fact that we have all these questions, the fact that there is
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.360]   so much debate over it, I think kind of says, hey, these people did know what they were
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.920]   doing, even if their methods were simplistic, they were effective.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.040]   And now there's a certain question over who was taking part or not, which I mean, it's
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.600]   even if you leave people with questions over who committed the crime, then you're kind
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.080]   of a good criminal in a way.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.520]   Yesterday, the Guardians of Peace, the hacker group that took credit for the Sony attack,
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:25:03.520]   mocked the FBI, saying, quote, "The result of investigation by FBI is so excellent that
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.800]   you might have seen what we were doing with your own eye."
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.720]   The Guardians of Peace wrote in a statement posted on Paste Bin.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.280]   "We congratulate you's success.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.000]   FBI is the best in the world.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.640]   You will find the gift for FBI at the following address and joy, and it was a link to a YouTube
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.600]   video titled, 'You're an idiot.'"
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:28.040]   On the other hand, if it is North Korea, that would be a reasonable way to kind of hide
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.040]   their involvement.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.320]   I don't know what to believe on this, but both of FBI and the president both say, no,
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.880]   there's no question it's North Korea and North Korea alone.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.760]   It just doesn't smell right to me.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.200]   I mean, we don't entirely know who to believe.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.360]   There's reasons why the North Korean government, why our government, why all these folks might
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.360]   not give us the truth or might not have all these details.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.560]   I think it's hysterical when they say, as some American officials have said, this is
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.360]   the first example of true cyber warfare.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.000]   This is the beginning of the end.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.400]   And of course, we've been pursuing cyber warfare against countries all over the world for decades.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.360]   So it isn't the first example of cyber warfare by any means.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.560]   Not to mention the fact that Sony is not a government agency.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   It's a company.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.600]   Yeah, the president called this an act of cyber vandalism, not an act of cyber warfare.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.880]   I think that's an important word to use.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.080]   And some people call it terrorism.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.880]   I think vandalism is more appropriate than terrorism, isn't it?
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.440]   Yeah, because this country has declared a war on terror.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.440]   Right.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.680]   If you were an act of terrorism, then you could make the conclusion that we should go
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   war with them.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   What would you be?
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.640]   The president says, we'll pursue a proportional and appropriate response.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.120]   It would be a proportionate response to an act of cyber vandalism.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.880]   We go spray paint.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.560]   I don't know what what I mean, what would be a proportionate response?
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.680]   As economic sanctions, there is an economic hardship to this.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.720]   Sony spent $40 million in Seth Rogen and James Frank or whatever you think of the interview
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.480]   and it didn't look like a very good movie.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.800]   Look, they spent a lot of they spent, you know, considerable amount of time effort.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:11.240]   And the only problem is North Korea is already under some of the most strict economic sanctions
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.280]   that we have on any of the other works.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   Exactly.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.120]   So it's hard to like, how do you, you know, how do you really get back to them if you
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   plan to do that?
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.840]   My biggest concern honestly with the whole fiasco, because really the word fiasco, I
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:29.160]   think, that's the right word, represents the best is the fact that the movie theaters
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:36.040]   kind of strong armed Sony into letting them not, you know, show the movie.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.760]   You know, if Sony was smart right now, they would put this all over the internet for free
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.720]   everywhere.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.080]   And just, you know, that you can't stop that.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.080]   And then it's there and it's, you know, they sure they lose on it, but they lose on it now.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   Right.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.640]   Or even smarter, they hang on to it in 10, 15 years, they launch, they release it as a
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.600]   limited edition and make a ton of money.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.480]   They'll do that for sure.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.640]   Don't you think?
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.480]   So one of the reasons they didn't want to release it right away, I worked on a story
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:14.040]   with one of our reporters in Hollywood is every major movie has insurance coverage.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.940]   And if the movie never comes out, then they have a claim to collect their insurance money.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.480]   If they were to release it on streaming, then it becomes a little fuzzier and they may not
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.920]   be able to make some of their money.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:30.600]   This just came in this morning from the New York Post, you know, not the greatest source
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.880]   in the world.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:38.480]   Sony plans to release the interview on crackle, which is its internet movie channel for free.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.440]   First of all, I understand why exhibitors might be reluctant to show this after the,
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   okay, there's a whole bunch of stuff to say.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.240]   First of all, the hackers didn't mention the interview until the media speculated wildly.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.840]   Oh, this must maybe this is North Korea punishing Sony or trying to stop the interview.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.320]   And then all of a sudden the hacker said, oh, yeah, that's what this is about.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   The interview.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.880]   Oh, yeah, that's it.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.280]   And then the exhibit and then they said, we're going to, we're going to, I mean, this feels
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.440]   like they're making this up as they go along.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:13.400]   We're going to a 9/11 style attack on movie theaters if they show this movie.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.200]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.960]   And then the movie exhibitors, I think reasonably because it's not, look, you got the Hobbit.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.600]   You don't, who needs to show this?
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   The reason is that that's fine.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   We'll take that theater.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   We'll put another hobbit showing in there.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.920]   We'll make more money anyway.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.080]   They decided not to show it.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.520]   And then Sony says, well, huh is the Hobbit a Sony movie?
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.440]   No, I'm not talking about Sony, the exhibitor.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.880]   The exhibitor doesn't care.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.160]   We don't have to run this stupid movie.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.960]   We didn't want to anyway.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.640]   We got Annie.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.960]   That's a so.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.400]   So I think the exhibitors just, you know, caved and then Sony, what are they going to do if
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.480]   nobody's going to distribute it?
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.560]   So I think, but on the other hand, the president said, wait a minute, that's appeasement, that's
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.800]   caving to terrorists.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:02.440]   I don't know what were they going to put national guard in the movie theaters?
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.000]   And then you'll, oh, I'll go see that movie.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.560]   Oh, there's armed, oh, it's safe there though, because there's armed guys guarding the door.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:16.240]   Anyway, according to the post, they're going to put it on crackle.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   And where can you get crackle?
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   Does anyone actually use crackle?
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.240]   I have crackle.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   No, it's on Apple TV.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   OK, it's on Roku.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.640]   It's on a lot of the internet.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.840]   Things in there probably is a crackle website.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.160]   You think?
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.560]   Now Mashable saying maybe not.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.960]   Yeah, Mashable, somebody posted this in the chat room.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:43.920]   I guess somebody inter, oh, the lawyer from Sony was on Meet the Press yesterday and said
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.000]   they're not voting in on crackle.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   No.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.080]   I think there's some genuine fears on Sony's card that this isn't totally over yet.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.680]   I mean, supposedly the hackers, if they are the hackers, actually said that there's more
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.680]   good voice.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   Permission to release.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.440]   They haven't given away all their cards yet.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.400]   And if they can take down Sony's entire system like this, maybe they could go after people
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   personally.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.840]   So I think there's some fears there on Sony's part that this isn't over yet.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   So I don't know.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.440]   I would be dubious of a report saying that they're going to release it on crackle or
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.160]   PlayStation video or just put it up on a torrent site or something like that.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.840]   Sony's lawyer David Boyes is the guy who's been strong arming people about this, trying
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.200]   to get the contents of the Sony hack taken off of websites.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.000]   Don't publish this.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.280]   Seize and desist letters, everything.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.280]   He was on Meet the Press.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.600]   Yeah, telling news publications that they can't write about this because it's stolen material.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.240]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.400]   Yeah, nice try.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   Ridiculous.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.920]   Boyes says it will be distributed.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   How it's going to be distributed?
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.120]   I don't think anybody knows quite yet, but it is going to be distributed when asked about
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.600]   President Obama's remarks that Sony had made a mistake by pulling the film.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.280]   He said, "I think it was helpful to have the president recognize publicly that this was
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.600]   an unacceptable attack.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.640]   We cannot have state-sponsored attacks that are designed to censor what we do here in
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   this country."
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.800]   But he didn't address the question.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.360]   Didn't address the question.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.800]   Because he's a smart lawyer.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.120]   He knows how to deflect.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.040]   Miriam, you're with me though, right?
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   There's something going on.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.040]   It's something fishy.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   It's something fishy.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.360]   You know, the movie is already out on the torrents if you search for it.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.360]   It's there.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.120]   Have you seen it yet?
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.200]   I haven't had a chance to download and watch it yet.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:29.640]   I'm kind of with the people who say it's not completely kosher to look at the stuff
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.480]   that was stolen.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   Where do you guys?
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   What's the journal?
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.480]   You're talking about as journalists?
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.120]   I mean, some of it, of course, it's I think there's a public need to know when you find out
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.360]   that the Sony folks try to get the Mississippi Attorney General to shut down Google.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   That's of genuine public interest.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.600]   I don't think there's any public interest in knowing what Amy Lucas said about Angelina
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.080]   Jolie in an email.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.440]   I mean, I would actually totally disagree.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.080]   I think there's a ton of public interest in the way that Sony does business, in the
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.720]   way that they make decisions on what films get financed, and what stars get put into
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   what films.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:14.520]   Even things, some of the stuff that was leaked in these emails was male and female executives
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.720]   doing the exact same jobs, had a pay disparity of a million or two million dollars.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.360]   There's some stuff there, too, and the harassment that's been covered up, things like that.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.640]   So there's Project Goliath, the Andy Google Project.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.640]   So there's all of these things.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.000]   And I think as the press...
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.600]   Really, should we be telling people how much James Franco made on that movie?
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   Okay.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.960]   I think that feels like that's stolen material.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.040]   But that's part of the business of Hollywood, too.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.480]   I mean, we talk about how much a film was financed for.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:47.440]   We talk about its box office nationally and overseas, how much the stars of the film get
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.320]   paid factors into these decisions.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.240]   And if you're a business publication, the people who read your publication are going
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.240]   to want to know what it is.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   Like Sony investors.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.240]   Like Sony investors.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   Okay.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.240]   All right.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.240]   I guess you're right.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.480]   I think the way to look at Leo is when all the stuff was leaked by WikiLeaks, right?
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.800]   Of course, we're not supposed to be looking at this stuff.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:12.520]   But as journalists, it's important that we're there to find a story.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:20.360]   And we are allowed to investigate and uncover things that aren't right about both our governments
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:27.280]   and companies out there and make opinions on culture and society and their behavior.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.680]   And I think that...
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.160]   So I can see how hard it is.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.720]   We draw the line, for instance, we wouldn't release the social security numbers or the
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   passwords, right?
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   We draw lines.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.320]   No, no, you know, there needs to be a public need to know or public...
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   Absolutely.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.760]   There's a question about ethics and privacy here.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.240]   But I'm saying that, you know, when you...
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.560]   It's kind of a gray area when it's, you know, when it's a higher level of execs and others.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.680]   I mean, I want to talk about social security numbers here and passwords.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.200]   I'm talking about, you know, these emails.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.880]   And I think that, you know, we learned a lot from the weekly stuff and we're learning a
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.400]   lot right now from the Sony stuff.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.200]   And some of it is bad, but some of it is good.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.520]   And I think, you know, as journalists, we should be allowed to, you know, you shouldn't
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   be...
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.520]   I think...
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520]   I don't think we should necessarily...
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.080]   It's up to us to decide whether we feel it's ethical to do this.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   But I don't think we should be threatened legally.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   No, I think Sony is wrong in doing that.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   You were saying?
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   I agree with you on that.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.320]   But I do feel like that you...
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:31.720]   People are stretching that public need to know a little far in order to get a few more clicks.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.920]   The news value for WikiLeaks.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.760]   I mean, there was some stuff in there of government atrocities and, you know, wrong
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.760]   doing it.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.160]   You can't compare this to the Snowden leaks, to the Pentagon papers.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.200]   Those things were illegally obtained and absolutely in the public interest to reveal.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   And there are things within Sony that are as well.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.640]   Well, I think they made a good case of business stuff for business news payers.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   But I mean, you can argue the news value, the societal value of TMZ or, you know, People
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.640]   Magazine.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.880]   I mean, like, you can always argue that something, you know, sports as a whole.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.080]   I'm a huge sports fan, but, you know, you can always make that argument.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:15.160]   I know if somebody stole something from the 49ers back office and gave it to the Wall
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.480]   Street Journal, it would be appropriate for the journal to publish that.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.000]   I think it depends on what it is and what the value...
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I mean, like the decisions that the journal makes in terms of what we cover...
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.800]   And we should say, I know Nate is not speaking for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   I don't want to get you in trouble.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   But any newsroom...
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   Right.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.480]   You know, that's a decision that newsroom has to make, right?
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.600]   So I think part of the issue too is, you know, something that's stolen from the 49ers back
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.760]   office and given over to the news organization is different than something that hackers took
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.440]   and then published publicly on the internet anyways and put out in data dumps.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.440]   And it's...
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   They've already published it.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   It's already out there in the public...
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:55.600]   I don't think anybody's see it really, if Mashable and the journal and everybody didn't just write
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   articles about it.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.280]   That's where most people are going to read it.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.560]   Well, nowadays, nowadays, what would happen is, you know, some folks who were savvy could
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.720]   go and get it and they'd put on Reddit or they'd put on Twitter or they'd put on their
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.720]   own blog.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   I mean, it would get out and...
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:13.800]   Well, Reddit has been actually caving to the DMCA request of Sony and pulled stuff down.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.200]   Sony has gone to Reddit and said, "Uh-uh, that's copyright material."
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   And YouTube has too, right?
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.400]   There was the death scene from the movie.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.400]   Is that King Jong-un?
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   Yeah.

[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   Wow.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.400]   That's taking a little bit personal.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:48.400]   BBC Panorama actually secretly filmed inside factories and
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   they went to Indonesia where these, as Apple called it, artisanal tin mines are
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   operating sometimes with children.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   Apple's response.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   Apple has publicly stated that tin from Indonesia ends up in our
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:05.400]   restaurants and some of that tin, well, yes, likely comes from illegal mines.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.400]   Tens of thousands of artisanal miners are selling tin through many middlemen to the
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.400]   smelters who supplied a component suppliers to several world.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   It's a problem that supply chain goes on and on and on down down down.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   The government is not addressing the issue in Indonesia and there's widespread corruption
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   in the undeveloped supply chain.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.160]   Our team visited the same parts of Indonesia visited by the BBC and of course we're appalled
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.760]   by what's going on there too.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.880]   But Apple has two choices.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:36.320]   We could make sure all of our suppliers buy tin from smelters outside of Indonesia.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.960]   This would be the easiest thing for us to do.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:47.480]   But would certainly shield us from criticism but it would be the lazy and cowardly path
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:52.360]   because it would do nothing to improve the situation for Indonesian workers in the environment.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.920]   Since Apple consumes a tiny fraction of the tin lined there, we chose the second path
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.000]   to stay engaged and try to drive a collective solution.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.600]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.920]   That's the old, we'll fix it from within.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:11.920]   But I mean that's kind of the approach that Apple and a lot of other companies take it
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.920]   for quite a long time.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   I don't know what you're going to do.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.920]   By the way, we're all complicit in some regard here because we buy these products.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:25.960]   Well, one of the things that Apple's lawyer told the BBC was that they've been working
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.320]   with their suppliers to improve conditions for workers and that they found about an average
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:36.040]   of 93% compliance with some of their guidelines like a 60-hour work week and things like this.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:41.320]   I mean, that still leaves a 7% that isn't complying, right?
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.320]   Here's worker standards.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:47.560]   It's falling asleep on the supply chain because they've been working 12 hours and more.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.760]   So what is the right approach?
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.120]   Is it to bail all these folks who are treating their workers incorrectly and maybe, I don't
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.760]   know, spend more money manufacturing different countries, getting stuff from different companies.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.080]   I don't even know if there are any of these suppliers that are actually following all
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   the rules.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.440]   I mean, this is kind of an ongoing story that's been happening for years and years and years.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.040]   This isn't anything new per se.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.480]   So what is the right approach inside or outside?
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   I don't know.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.560]   I mean, the thing is a lot of these companies, like you were talking about the supply chain
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.040]   goes deeper and deeper and deeper.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.600]   They don't have direct relationships.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   They know.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   They're not buying it from these.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   They might have Foxconn.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.200]   Foxconn, you buy the tin.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.120]   Foxconn buys the tin from a smelter.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.080]   The smelter buys it from some gang in the Congo.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.080]   So then how much influence would Apple have over tin smelters if they actually do buy
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.560]   a small percentage as they say they do?
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.080]   Then they show up and there's all these middlemen in between.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.800]   I have to say, though, good on the BBC.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.000]   This is good work they did with these hidden cameras, right?
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.560]   It's pretty insane.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.560]   That's awesome.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.880]   This is kind of how things work all over the world.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:04.560]   I mean, the LA Times just had a great series of stories on Mexican produce farms that
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.640]   were treating their employees and properly making them, having children work, work way
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   over hours, and those fruits were going to like Whole Foods and Walmart.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.320]   This is not just tech.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.400]   This is not just Apple.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:20.640]   This is like a global issue with the way that we do business as a whole.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.720]   I really feel like Tim Cook, I believe him when he says, "No, I'm offended.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.600]   We really are going to do it the best we can.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.200]   We're going to continue to do what we can to make these conditions improve."
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.360]   We know they're not perfect, but we really care.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.400]   The reason I think he feels that way is because of what nature said.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:43.360]   I mean, this is, you know, he's worked really hard to try to improve it already.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.360]   And it was always Apple has targeted, but like, what about, you know, Samsung and HTC
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.560]   and Xiaomi and what about, you know, Whole Foods?
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.880]   What about, you know, the textiles we wear?
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.880]   Like, there is this stuff going on everywhere and it's always, and I think that's kind of
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.720]   what he's probably feeling.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.320]   Like, he's like, throwing his arms up in the air going, you know, not again.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.160]   Like, you know, this is not just about us.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.440]   This is about the entire consumer industry.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.600]   We want the stuff so cheap that at this point, it's really hard to get a manufacturing in
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.560]   a ethical way, right?
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.880]   I think the whole system used to be reevaluated.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.120]   We all have to think about this every time we advise something, you know, and that's
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.000]   where fair trade and all that stuff is really important.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.280]   And this is the other side of the coin of Apple's success.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:34.800]   I mean, you know, you become this brand and a brand that is kind of has a reputation of
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.460]   quality brand that cares, then you're going to be, I mean, of course, BBC could have
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:45.040]   taxed Samsung and everybody else because they're all getting the tin from the same place.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.560]   But Apple, because of its success, is going to be the taking the brunt of this.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.280]   I think that's part of the gig.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.920]   But I think they should fight back and they're right to say, you know, we're doing them what
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.920]   we can and we're going to continue to do what we can.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.680]   And I think the BBC should continue to hold the fees to the fire and everybody's feet.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.000]   And really, most importantly, us as consumers.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.960]   I mean, you could praise Apple for doing something.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:11.680]   There are companies that do more Intel and HP tend to have a track record for being more
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   involved in their supply chains and going deeper into the supply chains and doing external
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:20.600]   audits, which Apple only recently started doing in the last couple of years.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.720]   So you're in your experience.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.800]   There are other companies that are working harder than Apple.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:33.320]   Intel has a excellent reputation for environmental and social governance.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.040]   Apple is still fairly high up there.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.840]   One of the worst is Nintendo.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:46.440]   According to a lot of these experts, they say Nintendo buys from bad sources and doesn't
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.960]   seem to do anything to try to repair itself.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:55.880]   Most companies just take a sort of like, you know, close their eyes approach to it.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.040]   And Nintendo has had a reputation for being one of the worst.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.240]   Fair trade consumer electronics.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:05.400]   Miriam, I think you need to start this.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   Locally source.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.200]   Locally source is far into table.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.640]   Which farmer made my Samsung Galaxy Note?
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   That's what I wanted to make.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:17.160]   After doing crowdfunding, that's more boutique and more vetted and curated.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.400]   I should do this.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.400]   Okay, good.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   You're ready.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.400]   You're ready.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.400]   Take it on.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.400]   And I'm starting side projects at the price center.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.680]   So might as well, right?
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.160]   I think you're having more fun this way, aren't you?
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.160]   I bet you are.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.160]   Well, I am, but you know what?
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.840]   At the same time, ultimately, at some point, I'm going to have to pay my bills.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.840]   Oh, that.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.960]   And have benefits and stuff.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:41.440]   And so it's, you know, I'm still definitely looking for something fun that's full time.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.160]   I'm sure there's something out there.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.720]   It's just a matter of time.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.640]   But until then, there's CS, you know, speaking of electronics and consumerism.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.680]   No, everybody's trying not to think this is just around the corner.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.320]   It's literally just a few weeks away.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:59.200]   But, I mean, CS would be a great place to have like, you know, some sort of dialogue
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.120]   or maybe some sort of committee where the major companies get together.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.440]   And I mean, the suppliers show up to CS too.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:11.080]   I mean, the white label manufacturers, the pegatrons, the Foxcons.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:16.560]   A lot of these deals that are made are made in the, you know, Las Vegas hotel room suites
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.480]   that journalists don't get to go to because they're running all over the convention center
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.400]   writing about, you know, some new Kickstarter projects.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.880]   So here's, and by the way, thanks to the chat room for finding this.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:32.000]   Fairphone.com is a fair trade smartphone, which I have never heard of and probably many
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.880]   haven't in which they really pay attention to the supply chain and the manufacturing
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:42.240]   and recycling at the end.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.360]   I wonder who their manufacturer is.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.360]   Interesting.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   Huh.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:50.880]   I wonder how good the, no, I wonder how good the phone is.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:56.360]   It's real middle of the range is four Android 4.2 jelly bean, 16 gigs of storage, immediate
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   tech processor.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.360]   You just play.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.360]   It's a four point three.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.360]   Let's just see.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   Well, let me just see what it costs.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:11.680]   Because if it's, if it's inexpensive, okay, 310 euros, it's not cheap, but it's more
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.120]   than a one plus one.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.120]   Less than an iPhone.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.080]   Oh, I mean, it's less than an iPhone and it's out of stock.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.080]   Not true.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.760]   Actually, some Galaxy handsets unlocked go for about eight and a hundred bucks and the
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.920]   iPhone is about $700 unlocked.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   So really?
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   All right.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:32.880]   Sony, by the way, employees are now filing a lawsuit saying the company is at fault for
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:37.640]   the, for the hack and we want to be compensated.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.560]   I think it's primarily former employees who really are getting screwed by this because
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.200]   Sony is somewhat protecting current employees, but not.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:52.520]   Jerry finds that Apple is not liable for harming consumers and throws out this case, the iTunes
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:55:00.040]   DRM case, which has been going on since 2005, almost 10 years.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:05.440]   Apple could have been on the hook for $350 million plus damages as much as a billion
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.640]   dollars.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:12.720]   It was a class action lawsuit and the jury delivered a unanimous verdict saying that
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:20.640]   iTunes 7 released in 2006 was a genuine improvement, not just released for copy protection or to
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.000]   be anti-competitive.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.640]   And the judge said we thank the jury.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.640]   Goodbye.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.360]   I think the jurors deliberated for something like two or three hours in this case.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.000]   It wasn't even a question.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   It's pretty quick.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   Yep.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.920]   However, of course, there will be an appeal because these lawyers, they've been working
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.920]   on this 10 years.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.280]   They don't know, they really, they don't know what to do with themselves.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.520]   They don't have a job.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:46.880]   So they might as well just keep this going for as long as you can.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.880]   And keep getting paid.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.760]   You can pay, baby.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:55.560]   Paydays are coming.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.920]   Did you see Apple's new Christmas end?
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   I love it.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.760]   Did you see the Guardians take on it?
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.520]   I did not like the Guardians take on it at all.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.600]   The writer here, Hannah Jane Parkinson was a little bit just peeved.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:16.080]   Maybe a little cranky, maybe a little Scrooge crept into her eggnog.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.440]   What's not to love about this ad?
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.000]   This is a young woman going through grandma's stuff.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.320]   Hannah says, wait a minute.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.920]   She's not even dead and she's going through her stuff.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.920]   She's not going through her stuff.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:25.920]   She's going through records.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   Okay.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   Okay.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:31.640]   Which find clearly in like a living room or something like that, right?
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:36.440]   Finds a record that grandma made in the 40s while her husband was away in the war and
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:42.040]   sings to her husband.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.880]   And then daughter takes her Apple product.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:48.720]   By the way, this is a very low key Apple presentation.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.600]   You know, they didn't really, it's not a lot of Apple in this.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:56.160]   And the daughter makes some music.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.280]   She falls asleep with grandma in the couch.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.120]   She plays the piano.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.440]   She's learning the song.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:06.160]   She's learning the song and she's going to actually record a duet.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.640]   So Christmas morning comes.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.120]   It's a tear jerker in other words.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.120]   It's a tear jerker.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.760]   In fact, there's literally tears being jerked.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:21.320]   Here grandma finds an iPhone with the cleaned up recording on it.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:27.800]   As if her late husband and her granddaughter starts to sing.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   I just got chills.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.800]   I don't know.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   Did she get sitting on?
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.800]   Yeah, I did actually.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.840]   Let me buy her sits on the stairs and watches.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   Grandma just.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.400]   She has a little tear.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.880]   What's nice about this is very subtle Apple, right?
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.320]   In white headphones, especially since they've been going in the direction of just showing
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:47.080]   the products and every ad.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.880]   It was a nice, it was nice.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.880]   There was no chimney talent or.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:55.280]   I kind of like the fella and timber lake ads.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:59.400]   The only one I like is the one where he imitates like a French restaurant owner.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.680]   That one cracks me up.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.320]   All the others I can't really get into.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.320]   Can't take them.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.320]   That stupid accent.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   I don't know.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   Gets you every time.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.320]   It sounds just like Miriam.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   Oh no.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   We can't take our.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   I'm ready to make sure.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   We have a bunch like that.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   They need it.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.320]   Oh.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.320]   Oh.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.320]   Oh.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.320]   Oh.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.560]   Who is that to grunt when you do it, right?
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.560]   Why?
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:23.520]   I think it's a lovely ad.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:30.800]   I think Apple has certainly quartered this emotional appeal ad for the holidays.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.440]   And I think it seems to be working really well for them.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:39.200]   Apparently the six and the six plus are the most successful item iPhones so far.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.040]   And they're going to be making serious money this holiday season.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.040]   So good.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.520]   It's working.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.520]   It's working.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.880]   You know, also is working.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.040]   My Harry's razor blades.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:54.640]   Do you shave with Harry's?
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.200]   Yachts do.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:01.640]   Harry's was founded by a couple of folks who think that razor blades are too expensive.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.080]   You know, the old adage.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.480]   You give away the razor and you make it up on the blades.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:09.880]   Well, obviously, if you've seen the locked up razor blades of your local drugstore,
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.920]   you know, that's because they're the most pricey things in the drugstore.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:19.480]   As much as $4 a blade for that Gillette fusion, for half as much, you can get a better blade
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.000]   because Harry's bought the factory.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.280]   They actually found out the best razor blades are made by two German factories in the Solingen,
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.280]   Germany.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.440]   They bought one of them.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:33.040]   They own the factory and make millions of blades.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.480]   This way they sell them direct to you.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:39.680]   You get an incredible blade, but you also get the incredible price on the Harry's kit.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:44.920]   I want you to take a look at the at the, they have to the Truman and the Winston.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.960]   I'm not sure what the naming is here.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.960]   Winston Churchill.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.960]   Yeah, and Harry has Truman.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   I guess I don't know.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.680]   But anyway, the Truman kit is 15 bucks.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:59.480]   You get the handle, but actually these are gorgeous handles for different colors.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.680]   Three blades, you get the travel cover, which is very useful.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.800]   Put it right in your top kit there and you get some of that great Harry's either the
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.240]   shave gel or the shave cream.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.760]   There's the travel cover.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.160]   That's so great.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.720]   These blades will never cut you.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   They are gorgeous.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.720]   They're fabulous.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:19.520]   Once you get the kit, $15, you're going to get the blades to leave.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.800]   You get the subscription of the blades and the shave cream or the shave gel.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.120]   They also, by the way, have a nice aftershave now you'll really like your beard is soft,
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120]   feels good.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120]   It's shave so clean.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.560]   You're going to love it.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.040]   Engineered for high performance.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:38.640]   These blades are the best in the business for half as much.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.720]   You could take a look at the Winston.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.360]   You can get it engraved with your name.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360]   It's beautiful.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360]   Really nice.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.360]   $25.

[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.000]   gifts or Christmas kits this year.

[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.400]   Harryz.com use the offer code TWIT5 to save $5.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.200]   Yeah, there's some guy in the chair that says, "Well, I got 10 razors for a buck.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.000]   Those must feel good when you shave with those."
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.760]   They're probably made in most of the factories as well.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.520]   They're made with tin from Indonesia.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.400]   You are exploiting small children.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:49.880]   We are coming to the year end and so that means the year in search videos from Yahoo
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.920]   and Microsoft and of course Google.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.280]   Robin Williams.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.720]   Robin Williams is the number one search term.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.520]   I'm not surprised are you?
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.560]   Number two, the World Cup which was this summer.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.360]   Number three, Ebola.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.240]   If it was just Ebola or how do I not get Ebola?
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.960]   How can I get Ebola?
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.360]   Where do I have to avoid to not get Ebola?
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.280]   MH370, the Malaysian Airlines flight, they still haven't found it, right?
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.280]   No.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280]   No.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280]   Wow.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.200]   It's a big world.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.400]   You realize that.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.960]   You think, how can you lose a jumbo jet?
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.960]   But you can.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.960]   It's a big world.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   A lot of ocean.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.880]   ALS, remember the ice bucket challenge?
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.640]   Whatever happened to that?
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.560]   I think it ended when I did it.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.280]   I think it was the last one.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.280]   I think I killed it.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.880]   The last one, no one's like not cool anymore.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   Yeah, we're not going to do that anymore.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   Yeah, don't do that.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   Yeah, no.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.880]   What have you done?
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880]   What have you done?
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.880]   You broke the ice bucket challenge.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.880]   You broke the ice challenge.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880]   Yeah, let's challenge.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.440]   I broke the internet before Kinkardashian.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440]   It's true.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.440]   I was like.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.240]   Those things come and go so fast.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.920]   Everybody, like a month, everybody was dumping ice over their heads and then nobody
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   was.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.120]   It was just over.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.120]   It's not too late.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.400]   I mean, we could do it on the show if you want.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.680]   I thought if, you know, then you wouldn't be the last I was.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.680]   Flappy Bird.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.160]   So I talk about something that came and went.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.600]   Flappy Bird is number six.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.240]   Who searches for Flappy Bird?
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240]   Where can I get Flappy Bird?
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240]   I need Flappy Bird.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   What happened to Flappy Bird?
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.640]   Number three, Conchita worst.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.880]   We were talking about this on this week in Google on Wednesday and I got a lot of email
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.680]   from people in Germany.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.280]   It means like what, whatever or so what, right?
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:38.640]   Conchita worst sort of worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.640]   And what is it?
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.360]   How would you translate it?
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.520]   We have some Germans in the audience.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.520]   Is a sausage.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.520]   No, it's not.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.320]   See, that's what I thought.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.800]   I thought she was, she was Conchita's sausage.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.360]   But no, it means so what kind of or.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.560]   But first it's also slight.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.560]   So what?
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.560]   Yes.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:06.200]   It is a sausage, but it's also slang for so what kind of like like kind of like a like
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.280]   like a company in the sausage then.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.720]   I know what you're talking about, but it's pronounced differently than a sausage.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.240]   I'm trying to remember how it's pronounced.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.240]   We have Germans here.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.000]   They're talking in the language.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   They're saying.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.400]   We'll say it again really loud.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.840]   It's forced.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:22.840]   Huh?
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.840]   It's forced.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.840]   Yes.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.640]   Mia is worse, worse, worse, worse, worse.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.000]   Anyway, she's got a great beard.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.480]   She's got a great beard and a beautiful voice and won the Eurovision song contest.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.040]   And I think it's pretty obvious why people are searching like what?
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.560]   Isis number three.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.840]   I hope it's not like searching for beheading videos.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840]   It's just Isis.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840]   What is Isis?
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.000]   Frozen number nine and we're not talking ice bucket challenge.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   That's the Disney movie.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   That's kind of feel bad.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.160]   World Cup's number two, Sochi was number 10.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.600]   Winter Olympics is never as hot.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:04.400]   You know though, you got to wonder, does Google take all the porn searches out of this list
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.160]   and it's not, you know, weather in horoscopes probably up here, but this is top trending
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.160]   search.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.160]   Trending.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.520]   You know, I feel like they're maybe fixing it up a little bit.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.760]   Playing at the numbers.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.760]   Astrology.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.800]   Yeah, you probably like, you know, well, yeah, they probably ignore the, you know, consistent
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.520]   hum of whether Tim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, right?
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520]   Kim Kardashian's butt.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520]   Those are really trending.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.320]   You just always, they're always there.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320]   Tidal waves of searching.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320]   They're not trending.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.120]   Somebody, somebody someday is going to be honest, totally honest about the top 10 searches.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.120]   We want to know.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   I know.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.120]   Do we really want to know?
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.720]   Do we really want to know?
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.600]   I think we know.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.960]   It could be dangerous.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:51.520]   I think we know.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.520]   Spain.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.720]   So Spain passes a law saying Google News has to pay publishers a royalty whenever they
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   have their headline or snippets or any part of the content from that publisher in Google
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.000]   News.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.240]   Google says, but wait a minute, we make no money on Google News.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.840]   So forget about it and moves out.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.640]   They say, we're not going to do Google News in Spain anymore.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:22.360]   External traffic to Spanish news sites plummet double digit drop in the first day after Google
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:27.000]   dropped all Spanish sites from its Google News index.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.640]   So what did the publishers do?
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.640]   Were they contrite?
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.160]   Did they say, oops, we made a mistake.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.720]   Maybe we do need traffic from Google.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.840]   No, they went back to the Spanish parliament and said, hey, can you pass a law that makes
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.160]   Google News do it?
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:47.640]   That make Google do it.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.640]   So sad.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.280]   That worked out really well for that, isn't it?
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:57.960]   You know, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if then they pass a law in Spain says Google
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.840]   has to link to our sites and you have to pay us.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.840]   It's just extortion.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:09.360]   It just goes to show how the kind of traditional media just has no concept of reality when
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:15.240]   it comes to how significant companies like Google have become to the world.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.240]   They just don't get it.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.600]   They just take that stuff for granted and they don't realize like, you know, it's a
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.280]   bunch of Rupert Murdochs.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.280]   They're only important.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.360]   Yeah, they're only important because they, you know, people keep them relevant by going
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.520]   to them through Google.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:35.000]   I love though that within 24 hours, that's just, no, that's it.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   I know.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   Smack that.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   Flickr responded.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.840]   We remember we complained and a lot of people complained that Flickr was selling prints,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.920]   your prints and my prints, if they were Creative Commons licensed, which Flickr allows you to
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.080]   do.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.880]   They decided, oh, maybe we shouldn't have done that.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:55.440]   So they are going to not only kill the sales, but issue refunds, which is kind of a bummer
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.960]   if you bought some for Christmas.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.200]   Like, well, you're not going to get those.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:06.240]   And the truth is, I got to say, these were images that were licensed to be used exactly
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240]   like that.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:12.920]   Well, some of the Creative Commons says stuff says you can use it for non-commercial purposes.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.120]   These were not, these were licensed for commercial use.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:21.240]   People didn't understand that they had, because you have to go through the, in fact, you go
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.640]   through the checkbox.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.360]   And I mine are non-commercial, so they didn't, you know, sell mine.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.840]   Nobody can make money off of my pictures.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:35.520]   But if you used the Creative Commons license that said commercial, allow adaptations of
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.000]   your work to be shared, yeah.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.560]   Allow commercial use of your work, yeah.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.600]   And then Flickr publishes them and you go, wait.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.640]   Anyway, Flickr apparently realized that it was a worse hit to their reputation and not
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.640]   a big money maker.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.360]   Although I can understand why they thought.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.840]   Not as bad as when Instagram changed their terms of service to suggest that they own
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.840]   everyone's photography.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.360]   I think that had more to do with cash.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.360]   Oh, God, that was so bad.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.360]   Obviously, people got upset.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:08.560]   Yeah, it was unlimited use, but, you know, if they wanted to argue that they did own the
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.800]   photography and the rights to sell it to whoever they wanted to, they had that language in there.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.800]   Yep.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.280]   Big hit piece in the New York Times a couple of days ago.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:23.520]   What happened when Marissa Meyer tried to be Steve Jobs, Nicholas Carlson writing, saying,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   "Huh?"
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.080]   I was going to say before you go there, since we're on the topic of Instagram, I've never
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.360]   seen the news about it being now worth 35 million.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.360]   So, you know, despite that--
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   It's good purchase.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.960]   It's good purchase change, and they're a stumble that they did early on.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:40.960]   Well, you know why?
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.920]   They added four new filters.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.920]   That is awesome.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.400]   I think it's the filters.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400]   It's the filters.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.680]   Have you seen the new filters?
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.400]   I mean, come on.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.400]   They're great.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.040]   I love filters.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.920]   I did tweet an image before the show from Instagram.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.640]   Yeah, with the new filter.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.640]   I mean, it is pretty great.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.000]   Well, let me just take a picture of Nathan here.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   Look good.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   Here we go.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   All right.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   These new ones I could do slumber.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.680]   Guy's a good looking guy, isn't he?
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.680]   Oh, look at that.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.680]   Cremma.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.680]   Look at him.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.680]   Tweet that.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.680]   Ludwig.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.680]   I think you look good with Ludwig.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   That's what I--
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680]   This is normal.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680]   This is Ludwig.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   Nice.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680]   Nice.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.320]   Give him a Ludwig.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.360]   Oh, you can give him a lot of Ludwig or a little Ludwig.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.760]   It's a little bit.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   It's a little Ludwig.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.120]   Yeah, give him about like three-quarter Ludwig.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.840]   Little Ludwig, right this very minute.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.840]   All right.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.400]   And then I'm going to Instagram that.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.200]   And yes, Instagram is now-- oh, I'm going to tag you.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.720]   What's your Instagram handle?
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.720]   N-A-T-E-O-G.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   Nate O-G.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.720]   Nate O-G.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.720]   Yeah, you had it.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   Oh, by the way, look at that.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.720]   Nice.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   Is that a 49er keyboard?
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.720]   Is that a 49er keyboard?
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.720]   No, it's Christmas.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720]   It's ready gold.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720]   There's no green in there.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.720]   That's ready gold.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.720]   That's a 49er keyboard.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   That's a 49er keyboard.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.720]   It does little snow dropouts.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720]   Oh, my God.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   Now I forgot.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   What's your Instagram?
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   N-A-T-E.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   N-A-T-E.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.720]   N-A-T-E-O-G.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   Yeah, Nate O-G.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.480]   Because you're an original gangsta.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.280]   My last name is Olivadis Giles.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   And I'm maybe I'm a little gangsta.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.280]   Maybe I'm a little gangsta.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.280]   Maybe I'm a little gangsta.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.040]   Is that a Swift Key skin, by the way?
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.920]   That's a new holiday Swift Key skin.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.840]   Everybody gets for free.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.360]   All right, I've tagged you.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.320]   I'm going to add to the photo map.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.320]   Tweet it.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   You got your social media down there.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.320]   Should I tweet it too?
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.280]   Oh, you see you do that?
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.280]   You guys do that?
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   You should send it out on the Twitter.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   Oh, I got to log in.
