[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   from his travels on our nation's birthday.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   John decides every year to go to another small town somewhere
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   in America and set off fireworks.

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I load up your baggage with a bunch of fireworks and go through the thing.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   They never notice it.

[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   >> Yeah, you can keep the metal out.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   >> Keep the metal out, exactly.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Yeah, and he feigned ignorance on the whole Twitter thing.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I said, Kevin, you're beating me.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   He says, "Really?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I didn't, really."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I said, "Yes, you know you're beating me."

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   >> He doesn't-- he said, "We're tied."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I said, "Kevin, we're not tied.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You son of a gun.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I'll kill you."

[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   >> Yes.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   >> I want to get over 13,000 followers on Twitter.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   >> How close are you, Patrick?

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   >> Oh, that's easy.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   That's easy.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Who should people follow you on?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Follow?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> It should be Twitter.com/patricknorton.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   >> Twitter.com/patricknorton.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And you just follow Patrick Norton, all one where P-A-T-R-I-C-K and O-R-T-O-N.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   >> Spelled the very best, Norton.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> And follow the Real Devorak too, so he doesn't feel left out.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> Yeah, the Real Devorak, Twitter.com, the Real Devorak.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> Whatever you do, don't--
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> You won't regret it.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   You won't regret it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   >> No, actually, there's a lot of good content on there.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   >> Yep.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.560]   >> I have the new iPhone, and there's a really nice Twitter client on it, so I'm actually
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.880]   Twittering a little bit more.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   The only problem is--
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> Are you using Halo or another one?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   >> No, Twitterific.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   On the new iPhone, this is part of the new App Store, so it's a standalone app.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   But it uses the GPS, so it also says exactly where I am.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> That part, I'm not so big on.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   >> You know, usually I can look around and figure out where I am.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.840]   >> I think he means for people who are Twittering with you, we'll know exactly where you are,
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   John.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   >> You know, it gives out--
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   >> I don't want anyone knowing where I am.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   >> Oh, exactly.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   >> I want to know where I am.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.280]   >> They're in lies the rub, John, we agree.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.560]   >> There's a program called Looped with a T, not an ED, L-O-O-P-T, that'll say, you
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.400]   know, roughly, you know, you're at Main Street and I.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.640]   But Twitter, it gives you the longitude and latitude of like eight decimal places.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.720]   Like within an inch of me.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.000]   >> It's only people that's worth anything to, or the guys who drive those black helicopters
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.040]   so they can pinpoint the hit.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.640]   >> Oh, that's right, the cruise missile's coming straight at me, isn't it?
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.040]   >> Hita, when that happens.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   >> Oh, I hate it.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   >> Eventually, eventually.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040]   >> Hey, can I tell you what I hate?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   I was really angry.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.680]   So we did this 24 hours of iPhone.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.520]   It was great fun.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.720]   It was crazy, but it was fun.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.160]   You know, I started when the iPhone, you know, I attended the morning on Thursday as the
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.400]   iPhone's going on sale in New Zealand and Australia and what do you call it, Australasia?
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   >> Whatever.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.520]   >> Some, some name for that thing.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.560]   >> I got more people complaining to me about this 24 hours of iPhone coverage than they
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   did to you.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   >> Why were they complaining to you?
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.960]   >> That's what I'd like to know, A, and B, who cares?
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.280]   I mean, if nobody wanted to watch you talk about the iPhone for 24 hours, you didn't
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   have to.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   >> You're saying people were complaining?
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.640]   >> Yeah, they said it was just too much iPhone, whatever.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.400]   >> They complained to you.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.480]   >> That I was going to go on the air for 24 hours talking about the iPhone.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.400]   >> No, they did it after the fact.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   >> Oh, it's funny.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   I didn't get one complaint.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   >> I know.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   Isn't that weird?
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   >> Mine like complaining to you.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   >> Mine like complaining to you.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   >> I know I'm complaining to Leo.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   What are you complaining to me for?
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   >> They're scared of me.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   They know.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.000]   I can, I can, I can send a cruise missile their way.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.400]   I know their exact pinpoint, their exact location.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.840]   No, so I did 24 hours.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.000]   So I started where it went on sale and then we ended, I was going to end when it, when
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.840]   the last store opened in Honolulu, I was going to go, you know, like around the world.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   Like by 10 a.m. the next day, nonstop coverage, I had, I had enough.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.920]   But one of the things that was really fun about five o'clock on Thursday, we talked to
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.360]   Woz for about half an hour.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.280]   Steve Wozniak, the creator of, I don't know, some computer or something.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.840]   And, and he said there and then he said, I said, you know, you could get a phone.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   I'm sure sent to you.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.000]   He said, no, no, I like to go and wait in line.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.040]   I'm going to go to the, he said, you don't have to say where you're going.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.800]   I said, no, I'm going to the Valley Fair Mall.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.880]   He really likes meeting people.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.560]   And, you know, remember that from the screensavers, Patrick.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.280]   I mean, he just, he's very friendly.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.320]   By the way, Patrick, you're at 13,068 followers by the way.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   Woo hoo.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   Thank you.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   You want more?
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   Absolutely.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.480]   This is funny.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.360]   Rose may beat me, but I still have a little bit of power.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.320]   So I get a story.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.640]   So, uh, Woz says, no, I'm going to Valley Fair Mall.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.360]   I said, he said, I'll go around four o'clock.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   I did it last year.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   It was really fun.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   Uh, I said, you're on waiting line.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360]   He said, yeah, it's funny.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.360]   He said, you know, the guys at the store, they've saved you up.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.160]   How was, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.480]   How was waiting in any line whatsoever?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.640]   Quote unquote fun.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.240]   John, unlike you and I, maybe he likes people.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.680]   I'd, I'd like people, what's waiting in line got to do with liking people.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.880]   It's actually really fun.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.120]   You're standing in line.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.440]   No, no, it's fun.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.360]   You're not, first of all, you're not standing because it's four in the morning.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.440]   You're sitting and, and, and I had the greatest time last year I waited in line.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.000]   I didn't do it this year, but last year I waited in line.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It was really fun.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.560]   I think, wait, I mean, I think we've got to stop here and take a sociological look at
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.880]   this waiting in line phenomenon as fun.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.840]   There's a book in it.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.280]   There's, there's, there's, this isn't waiting in line because it's chow time at Fort Dix.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.600]   You're shuffling your stainless steel tray.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.200]   You know, Lisa, could I have an iPhone?
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.960]   You know, this is, this is a bunch of people together.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   Together in line.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.840]   I go, gathering is one thing waiting in line.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   Well, it's a party.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.640]   So we have to have an excuse, a bogus excuse, like waiting in line to get together.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.720]   Is that how sad the culture has become?
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.720]   Is that what you're telling me?
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.720]   That's fine.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.560]   I think the sign that the culture can have fun anywhere, John.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.480]   With the right people, I can make doing laundry and absolute blast.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.000]   With the right, I can make a trash out a party.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   You know what?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Attitude like that.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   You're not getting invited.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Can I just?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.480]   Can I just say I really missed you guys.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.360]   I'm going to get back to the story.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.800]   So waiting in line is it can be a celebration.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.960]   I chose not to do it.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.320]   And actually you're probably in the majority, John, because as it turned out, the lines
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.840]   were very short, not like last year at all, until about six or seven and then everybody
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.400]   starts showing up.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.600]   And I think more people showed up in the end to buy these iPhones.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.920]   We'll talk about the activation nightmare that happened as a result.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.960]   I think more people showed up this year than last year.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.840]   However, they learned their lesson.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.000]   They didn't show up eight hours early.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It was.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.960]   He showed up four hours early, four in the morning.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.040]   That tries to get in line.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.720]   The store says, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.640]   Your Mr. Steve Wozniak, the event or the Apple II computer, the creator, the personal
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.160]   computer revolution, please have a seat over here.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.320]   We'll let you know when the store opens.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.040]   He says, no, no, no, no, please sit down.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.160]   He told me in the interview, this is what he said, there's people saving place for me
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160]   in front and line.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.480]   I was going to go at 11 at night, but I'm going to wait till four in the morning now.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.600]   So he even told us this was going to happen.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.920]   So there's a couple, the Bruce Ards, who when the doors open, they see Woz stroll up to the
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.200]   front of the line as the store insisted and go in and buy his iPhone and they were really
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   upset.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.600]   These people who are probably in line waiting to sell their place and they went and they
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.640]   talked to a reporter at Cnet, Greg Sandoval, who wrote a hit piece on Woz saying, was jumped
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.640]   the line.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.080]   Oh, he's using his influence to jump the line and everybody was disgruntled.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.520]   Did he check with a store? No. Did he check with anybody else in the line? No. Did he
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.760]   check with Woz? No. Did he check with me? I knew what was happening. No. He wrote this
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.760]   hit piece.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.880]   Well, I don't think he really applies to check with you, but I think he should have checked
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   with somebody.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.120]   He apparently didn't.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.320]   But this is the kind of stuff that, I mean, I, oh, now I see why you're upset. I don't blame
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.800]   it. That's, that's very, that's the embarrassment.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.560]   They slimed the guy. Woz responds on page four of the comments. We finally seen at amended
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.920]   the article to point to Woz's response and to cut and they really softened it a lot.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:59.000]   In fact, they added a question mark. They had the original headline was, was out of line
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.480]   at iPhone store, then they added a question mark like 10 hours later after everybody said,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.220]   you say, Hey, let's break stop. Depresses. Steve Jobs got an iPhone before they even
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.220]   shipped them. Yeah.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.080]   It's a scandal. It's a scandal.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.760]   Well, and that's what they pointed out is that was could have gotten one, but no, he instead
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:22.280]   decided to jump the line at the Valley Fair mall. Please. This is the worst form of shop
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.760]   shoddy journalism. Gizmodo, who was the writer again? Let's, let's get him fired because
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.800]   he deserves to be Greg Sandoval. Nobody needs to be fired. They need to be
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.880]   excoriated. Okay, let's say I'm excoriating him. Does that mean hitting him with a sharp
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.360]   stick? Exactly. I'm excoriating him. That's just shoddy journalism. And I wonder if how
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.880]   much of this has to do with the fact that CBS took over two weeks ago.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.960]   Now it's got nothing to do. CBS doesn't even know about this story. You're the probably
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   the only one. Well, I think, you know, what it, what it indicates to me is it is it's
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.880]   not the shoddy journalism thing that bothers me. It's the who gives a crap. Well, it is.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:04.200]   It's a valley wag story at best. Yeah, right. Why is this in the headline story at cnet.com
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.320]   and then Gizmodo picks it up. And by the way, dropped it like a hot potato very quickly
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.760]   backed up and said, no, wait a minute. We were wrong. We were wrong. I don't know a
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.840]   valley. I don't think even Valley WAG picked this up. Well, Valley WAG, first of all, is
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.200]   supposed to be for the 50,000 people that care about VC funded companies. 5,000. Whatever
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.240]   your your big generous. You know, I think I think 50,000 is probably a little closer.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.640]   Okay. I just want to say one thing. Yes. As long as wise doesn't talk about lasers.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.520]   I mean, he wants he actually when I talked to him on Thursday evening, he said, I love
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.680]   doing Twit, having on Twitter, I love to talk about the news. So I actually invited
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.400]   him because I wanted him to come on and give and give his response to this. But I would
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.520]   like to step forward and defend the guy. There's absolutely no way in the world he did a line
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.960]   cut. And this is taking advantage of him and his. I don't care if he did a line cut.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.320]   He's got the he's got standing to do it. Yeah. And and even if he did it, let's say he did
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.760]   it. I'm saying I'm sure that the whole story didn't because he probably wouldn't. But
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.040]   even if he did, he has standing with differences in make there are two people dug in Patrice
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:20.200]   Broussard who are upset. Everybody else in line is going, that's what they have to have
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:27.760]   the first phone. What kind of a weird, what is that all about? Screwy as heck. Oh, you
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.920]   guys have to, you know, for OK, let's, you know, I can see where the Broussards are pissed.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.680]   They wait out. They want to be that person that walks out of the store. Well, they weren't
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.080]   number two. They weren't number two in line. They weren't number two in line. I don't think
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.160]   they were just in the line. So they were huffy. There's huffy annoying people everywhere.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:56.760]   Yeah. And well, and why this nitwit that's seen at Greg Sandoval, S-A-N-D-O-V-A-L. Why
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   this nitwit it's seen that's making this big deal out of it is being on me.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.120]   Well, you know, Leo, I think we need to take a deep breath and point out the fact that
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:09.480]   you're now making Greg Sandoval more famous, perhaps than ever. And probably driving more
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.280]   traffic to that story than everyone. Which will secure that he will in the future jump
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.240]   on anything that can act as this level. That's the way. Yeah, but that's the way. It's the
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   Borac baiting Mac users. It's going to be, it's going to be a must to do for him in the
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:32.560]   future. Why I got it. It's Sandoval rocks. Keep cleansing breath, Leo. I think what you
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.520]   just move on to one of the fabulous tech stories of the week. Okay, let's talk about eBay and
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.160]   PayPal and how they screwed me out of $2,200. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. I'd like to say this
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.440]   is an unusual story, but how did you how did you send the cash to this guy? This is my
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.840]   mistake. PayPal. Have you gotten any sleep in the last couple of days? I'm going to
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.720]   for the 48 hours of my phone and I've been talking about it nonstop. And now I'm really
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.240]   upset. We need to have you like this more often. That way I don't have to pick up the
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:09.600]   slack. I'm deeply caffeinated. Let's put it that way. I did get I did get in line. I
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.080]   did get in line to get an iPhone on Saturday. And actually, there was still quite a long
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.800]   line, partly because I think the activation issues, there were huge activation issues
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:26.720]   on Friday. It was as if neither AT&T nor Apple had any idea anybody would buy an iPhone.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.200]   It was as if a bunch of just what I heard from some Apple employees, a lot of stuff
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.040]   just didn't work the way they wanted it to. Yeah, and Apple blamed AT&T and AT&T blamed
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.600]   Apple. It was kind of interesting. There's a two. Nope. Well, that's never happened
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.680]   before. It was a two step process. The first step is AT&T has to approve your credit and
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:50.320]   say, okay, you've got an account. Then you have to hook the iPhone up to a Mac and iTunes.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.880]   And then the iTunes says, okay, you're activated. Now, when I did it on Saturday, it took a
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.440]   second for each. It was very, very quick. But people were waiting for hours. Apparently,
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.080]   not just in the US, but all over the world, these servers were crashing, not just AT&T's
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:10.000]   in other words, but O2, Vodafone, many of the other carriers were also having similar
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   problems.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.200]   It's a phenomenon. It's also up to scale for an event like this.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.480]   Well, that's exactly right. You don't buy bandwidth year round to handle this kind of
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.760]   traffic in one day. Oh, they should have been able to handle it. It wasn't that much.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   Well, and you know, I have to say, maybe there is some credibility in what AT&T's saying
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:36.240]   because Apple's own mobile me service, their new.Mac, was down for a long time. And then
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.240]   very, very slow too. Mobile me has not been working very well, even now.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.680]   Yeah, there's your cloud computing for you.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.640]   So, but I think I have to say, I bought the 16 gigabyte. I wasn't going to. I kind of
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:55.000]   got sucked in by this 24 hours of iPhone. It was such great marketing tool for Apple
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.120]   that I actually convinced myself to buy an iPhone.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.960]   But that took a lot of work.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.600]   I wasn't gone. I really wasn't. And you know what? We really won me over in it. It's
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.840]   not the GPS or the 3G because I don't even get 3G in Petaluma. But the app stores pretty
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.600]   good. Have you played with it at all? Neither of you have. Neither of you can.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.040]   No, I haven't even looked at it yet. You couldn't care less. I thought about it.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   I thought about it. I could care less.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.760]   I'm not much. Yeah. A friend of mine waited online for hours for one yesterday. So, I'm
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   waiting a few days before I go anywhere near an Apple store.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.960]   I have to say, the apps, you can go to iTunes and look at them and you don't have to buy
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.520]   them. But the apps are pretty useful. And what's really interesting, I think, is the
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.240]   I'm really seeing now this is going to be 2009 is going to be the year the location-based
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:48.480]   app. When Android comes out, the idea that an application knows where you are is so phenomenally
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.240]   useful in so many contexts. I think it's really interesting.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.360]   Well, how can we make money? Oh, Jack, are you kidding me? I'm asking.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.680]   A million ways. Well, for instance, the reason Google is so interested is because location-based
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:09.280]   advertising is a godsend for them. As you walk down the street, they say, "Hey, by the way,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.240]   there's a Starbucks just around the corner. I know you love a lot."
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.720]   Well, usually not on Google when I'm walking down the street.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.120]   No, but you would be if you had an Android handset.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:23.600]   Well, I'd be walking into telephone polls. No, it's a little more subtle than that. I
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   have to admit. I guess I'd probably need the GPS after being hit in the head by a poll.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.200]   Where am I? What am I doing? Well, here's a good example. Getting things done, which is a very
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:41.600]   popular geek to-do taxonomy. Among other things, what you do is you categorize your things to be
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.200]   done by where you are. They call them context. You can only obviously send email when you're at
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.240]   a computer or make phone calls when you're out of phone. You say the context is at computer or at
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.440]   phone. Well, because there's GPS built into the iPhone, the to-do list, and there's a company
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:03.120]   making this called OmniFocus from the Omni Group that your to-do list knows where
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.320]   stuff needs to be done. When you're there, it shows you the items on your to-do list that you
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.080]   can do right now because of where you are. If you're at the store, it says, "Well, here's your list."
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.760]   99% of my to-do list is cleaning the office.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.880]   That would come up a lot, wouldn't it? Yeah, it would. Have you done it yet?
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:27.040]   Wait, no. I wish I had. Let's get back to the other story before we dribble off to this stuff
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.080]   because I think everybody's on needles and pins or are you getting ripped off by
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.960]   an old pouring story. I wanted to buy another camera and a Canon XL2.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:44.800]   Did you rebel? No, no, no. The video cameras we use for Twit Live.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.240]   Oh, right, right, right, right. I have three of them. I wanted a fourth.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.880]   You had five. I have a GL2, so I have a total of five cameras now.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.240]   You can ever have-- It's starting to sound like a comfy pillow thing.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.840]   You can ever have too many cameras. It is. They're all around me. Everywhere you go,
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.640]   I have a camera on me at all times. It's after a while.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.480]   I found somebody who's selling it at a reasonable price. It actually, not a super good deal.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.880]   It was a normal-- what you'd expect to pay on these cameras. He had 100% rating for the last
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.080]   seven months. In every respect looked good, there was one thing that was a little suspicious.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.120]   He only had $200 of PayPal insurance, but it was a $2,000 camera.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.080]   So I won the auction $2,195. It was very happy.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.640]   Nothing. Never sent me a camera. Nothing. Now, I paid-- Now, here's my mistake.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.080]   Instead of paying for it by a credit card, which would have gotten me off the hook,
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.400]   you know that eBay not only encourages you to use PayPal, which they own,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.440]   has lobbied in some countries, including Australia, to make it the exclusive form of payment on eBay.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.040]   They want to force you to use PayPal. Boy, is that a bad idea. They make more money.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.640]   You have no recourse. You're in a closed loop. So I used PayPal to buy it stupid me.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.200]   Now, the guy doesn't even have the courtesy to send an empty box.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:09.440]   This guy is such a crappy fraudster. I don't know. He must have hacked somebody's account.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.040]   It's the only thing I could think of. How do you get 100% rating from all these transactions?
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.440]   I know. He put it in himself. Yeah. The promise is there's no way to track what the
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.600]   transactions were. Exactly. And what's interesting is you can look at who's giving them feedback,
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   because sometimes what you'll find out is somebody will do a half dozen accounts and link
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.520]   between the-- basically buy things back and forth between the accounts to build up it.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.640]   And usually, it's only several dozen. It would take a lot of work to take, say, 20 accounts
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.320]   and build them between them. Hopefully, that's something that eBay's anti-fraud team is working
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.360]   with. Well, that's the thing. I mean, any fraud team must be one guy in a back room under some
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.800]   boxes, because I don't think they're doing much to prevent fraud. They did nothing.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:55.840]   They have a very limited interest. And it's interesting. I had somebody try to scam me. I tried to buy
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:03.680]   a welder. And the guy's like, it was a welder being sold in Ohio. I win the bid. It's shocking
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.600]   he's low. He tells me it's brand new and never out of the box. The picture was a--
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:13.360]   And at this point, I'm thinking that's kind of odd, because it basically would have been about
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.680]   the third, the new price. And then it gets really squirrely. He tells me he wants to send what?
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.120]   A money order to a location where in Brooklyn. And that's like, as soon as somebody wants you
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.960]   to send a money order or a Western Union or anything like that, don't walk away run. So,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:34.720]   I emailed him and said, I'll use the escrow. And there's only one legitimate approved escrow service
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.800]   for eBay. And that's something where a lot of people, they claim they have an escrow service,
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.640]   and they're basically lying. I didn't even know there were escrow services. I should have used one.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:59.280]   It's really interesting. The guy ends up emailing the next eight bidders on the--
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.080]   It's www.esco.com. Basically says, I flaked and I won't pay him money.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.040]   Here's your chance. What they're like the buy-in. Here's your chance.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.600]   Four of the next, I guess, six or ten full money order, $600 to this guy vaporizes.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.720]   So, I end up getting a call a little while later from a lawyer in Kentucky who's working with a
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:24.480]   detective in Seattle or Tacoma or something. And they've been tracing some of these frauds.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:32.240]   Because basically one of the lawyers clients got snaked for a bunch of money. And it turns out,
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.720]   it's a bunch of people working locally and sending the money back to Russia. And it's all this crazy.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.680]   I mean, the eBay people are like, "Look, zillions of transactions take place every day. A very
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.920]   small number." Oh, yeah. I've bought a lot of stuff on eBay. This is the first time I've had a problem.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   But I've had that happen. But I did all the things you're supposed to do. I checked his ratings.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.800]   As it turned out, when I got the contact information, it was fraudulent. I think he actually hacked
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.400]   into somebody else's account. It's entirely possible. I should have known because his PayPal
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:12.960]   email was PayPal sucks. So that was the beginning of it. He gave me a non-existent shipping
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:18.560]   number. And I even checked with UPS and they said, "Well, that's a legitimately formed number,
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.880]   but it's not one that's ever been used. I must have gone out of the UPS store and filled out a
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.600]   form sent me a fax." The whole thing was fraudulent. PayPal investigated one month later.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.160]   I just got this E-info from PayPal. We're going to refund you 200 bucks.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:39.680]   Yeah. They basically tell you they're only liable unless you work with one of their protected
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:48.000]   bidders or something, or you use www.estro.com. I will never buy anything worth more than a couple
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.920]   hundred bucks. That's what I learned. The other thing I've noticed a lot recently is I have to be
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:02.480]   very careful about watching, especially for smaller items, watching about... Okay, so start from the
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.800]   basic one. And this is the thing you got scammed on is see whether or not there's been a lot of
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.480]   sales on the item or whether the seller has a positive feedback across lots and lots and lots
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.640]   of sales. Accounts can be hacked. People can flake. People can decide to cast out.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.720]   I should have made it a year and hundreds of sales. I wasn't paying attention. I totally blame myself.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.800]   If the bargain is too good to be true, it probably is.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.240]   In this case, it wasn't. In this case, it was an appropriate price.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:40.000]   I got to say a lot of times, if it's an appropriate price, I'd almost say go with a traditional
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.200]   thing. Well, it wasn't list price. It wasn't list price, but it was a price that, in fact,
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.080]   I ended up paying to Raymond, another guy who said, "I've got one. I'll sell it to you for the
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.760]   same price." And I said, "Great." And I said, "You sent it to me first, then I'll send you the money."
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.040]   Well, that's where if you're buying an expensive item,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:05.120]   www.esco.com, I've never used it. I'm not sure if I'll ever try to buy anything worth more than a
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.840]   couple hundred on eBay. Because I've also had some issues where PayPal, because I hadn't used my
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:15.440]   PayPal account in so long, somehow the PayPal mailing address, and this is my responsibility,
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:21.840]   I had not updated my PayPal mailing address, somehow got overwritten over my eBay accounts
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.000]   mailing address. So a bunch of items I purchased were shipped to an address I haven't lived at
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.960]   in over five years. And what's interesting is, what's kind of sad is one of these things happened
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:40.320]   while I was working for a major media company. I'm like, "Hey, there's a story here. How to not get
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:48.160]   frauded on eBay?" And I've never tried several avenues and never had any response from anybody
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   in PR inside of eBay. I think that the dirty little secret, they don't want to use the word
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:00.480]   fraud, because they know that people are nervous in general. They don't want to trigger those nerves.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:07.360]   And people make mistakes or something they're selling, the bid wins, and it's right before they
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.560]   go on vacation, and they forget to email the person who won the bid, and people freak out.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:19.440]   Does it work just fine for the majority of the people in the majority of the time? Absolutely.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.960]   Are there people committing some pretty nasty acts of fraud out there? Absolutely. I'd also
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:30.160]   warn people to watch out for the shipping and handling costs, because in a lot of cases,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.960]   especially on smaller items, you can end up paying more for the "handling" fee than you
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:42.960]   actually paid for the item and the shipping together, because people have decided they
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.480]   need to value the time it takes for them to put something in a box and take it to the post office.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:56.720]   So they charge you $5, or sometimes $10, or sometimes $39. So that's something you want to
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:04.800]   keep an eye on. And the truth is that the sellers have almost all of the rights inside of eBay's
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:13.120]   system. And it's just not... Do you think... Now, am I being unfair to eBay? Or do you think they
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.760]   could do a better job with this? The thing that was said is the only thing you could have done
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:27.120]   different would be to use an escrow service. And other than that, because this is or to have
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.160]   used your credit card through PayPal. Well, I certainly will never use PayPal to pay for eBay
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:42.640]   again. But the tragedy is the tragedy of the commons to perversional lesson is that there
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.840]   are some talented people who screw over people, and this is just another avenue for them to do it.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:57.360]   And PayPal's... PayPal or eBay for that matter, I spent two years trying to figure out
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.680]   how one of my original PayPal account got locked down. Well, that's another terror I have.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:09.040]   The paper... Yeah, they can lock that down anytime. Yeah, they're not a bank, and they're not subject
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:14.720]   to the same type of regulation. So I had a case where I got refunded. I guess somebody refunded
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.400]   some money and pulled it back out from a ski house. I was in it. And the only reason I had the PayPal
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.920]   account was really for this ski house, because that's the way the guy wanted to do it, because
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:27.440]   it was convenient for him. And my account got locked down. Oh, great. And then they're like,
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.520]   we want you to fax a copy of your driver's license, your bank account numbered all this
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.320]   information to this random fax number in their offices. And I was like, you know what, it's 300
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.800]   bucks. Forget about it. I'm not faxing a number of people are saying in the chatroom, hey, Leo,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:46.960]   it's your fault. The thing said $200 insurance, you're the one that you were stupid.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.320]   Well, that's certainly... I mean, that's certainly... I shouldn't have probably paid attention to
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.080]   how much insurance was on there, but I didn't anticipate a fraudulent seller.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:02.880]   Well, and the thing is, right? It's something absolutely. If anybody, I'd say if you're buying
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.000]   something that's worth more than pennies, a few dollars on eBay, I would protect myself to the
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.920]   maximum. Yeah, I would also buy the way PayPal only has insurance up to $2,000. So if you buy
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.640]   anything over $2,000 and you get ripped off, sorry, that's all we got to ensure.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.000]   You want to talk about seriously ripped off. I'm trying to remember the name of this
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.080]   couple, this older guy who's finally buying his dream car, buys this Mustang.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.920]   I don't know if he got the inspection or not, but it was visually perfect. He got a bunch of
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:40.240]   pig pictures and it turned out to have been an absolute... Basically, somebody bought a rusted out
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:48.320]   like '67, '68 Fastback. Bondo'd it, sprayed it with paint and shipped it to this guy. He ended up
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.520]   paying tens of thousands of dollars for a classic car that was literally the body was about to fall
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:59.760]   off. Basically, the body was about to fall over the... Yeah, in chunks. And I got to say, I've run
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.920]   into a lot of people that have been... A lot of people have had tremendously successful experience
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:12.080]   with eBay. All of my de-colb corn trophies have come through eBay. You're what? Your de-colb corn
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   trophies? Yeah, I've never seen the de-colb. You've never seen the de-colb corn trophies?
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.880]   Yeah, just do a search for decalb and flying corn and you'll get the idea. It's a Midwestern
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.800]   thing. I'll explain when you're older. How many do you have? Three Leo. It's nothing too out of control.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:32.720]   But I admit, if you want de-colb corn trophies, eBay is probably the first place you want to go.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:39.200]   Well, if I lose 40 bucks, I'm going to be pissed. Somebody trying to scam me for $800 for a
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:45.520]   welder. I got to admit it, that's when eBay started the sour for me.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.520]   John, have you ever bought anything on eBay or sold anything on eBay?
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:56.080]   He's disappeared. He's across the room. He's across the freaking room.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.960]   Everybody in a second, I'm putting on the barbecue. Sorry about that.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.480]   That's okay. Everybody's got it. No, I'll tell you this. My son, Eric,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.720]   actually, I don't think he's ready for me to promote something. He finished.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.160]   Wait a minute. Here's the de-colb corn toss. I'm sorry. I'm eating around.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.040]   The hell is that? That's the de-colb corn toss.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.560]   Opening would be something Patrick's elect.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:33.760]   Your son is using eBay to sell or buy? No, he used to do a lot of eBay stuff. He says now that
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.200]   they've put different kinds of restrictions in the PayPal thing and a whole bunch of other
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.680]   things makes it almost impossible for the small vendors to use this system and then to buy it
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.320]   instantly thing has become more of a retail operation than an auction. He thinks the thing
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.640]   is it's going to die. If I have anything to do about it, I'd love to put him out of business.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.720]   Well, here's something I hate to bring it up. I actually have about maybe I'll mention it
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.240]   next week because I have to ask him for permission. He's got a website up that's kind of interesting.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.280]   Yeah. Well, next week we'll plug it. We'll give it a plug. Yeah, plug it next week.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.600]   I don't really want to put eBay out of business. I just think it's unfortunate that they're not
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:15.760]   doing more. Obviously, I've learned from this and I want to pass along to people, as you just did,
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:21.600]   Patrick, some tips on not getting ripped off. You take a little bit of a chance when you're
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.040]   on this kind of an auction site. I wish eBay were doing more to prevent the fraud, but that's the
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:32.400]   way it is. I certainly won't buy anything on eBay ever again. I've given them my $2,000 or whoever
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.760]   that guy was. Hey, let's get on to with a Yahoo story that's a story that just will not die.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:43.040]   This is making me sick that it came up again. It's back, John. You didn't put a mistake through
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:52.720]   its money. Yahoo announced last night that it has rejected. I almost can't say this with a straight
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:58.560]   face that it has rejected a joint buyout proposal. This is though, this is a, this proposal is so
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:05.680]   sucky. Microsoft and Carl Icahn in bed together, right there is a bad image. It's a, what they call
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.520]   a complex restructuring. Basically, Microsoft will get the search business. Icahn would sell off the
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:19.760]   remainder. And by the way, we need a new board of directors in their pronto. Yahoo came back saying,
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.040]   "That would be actually why I don't know what I think he's got calling it the wrong thing.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.800]   And he's a board of yes men." Yeah, pardon me. That's what that's what we need. Let's say a
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:34.880]   terminology so important in these business trans, transactions. Yahoo said in rejecting the offer,
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:41.840]   will still sell you the whole company at $33 a share. I don't know how the Microsoft guy kept
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.480]   from laughing when they said that. A little too late for that. Mike, by the way, Yahoo's stocked
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:52.960]   down to 23 bucks. And the Yahoo shareholders, I mean, he's coming up August 1st to really,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:34:00.000]   that's the deadline because Icahn has of course proposed a slate of backing a slate of board
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.080]   members of his own hand. Yes, hand picked yes men. There you go. And he's suggesting the other kind.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:11.440]   Well, you could take random yes men, but they're not as good. You want to, you want to really vet
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:17.280]   them first. So basically there's a proxy fight. And that's going to come August 1st. Do you think
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:24.800]   why can't we'll win? God, let's hope not. I know. I mean, regardless of the business story here,
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   which is endless and tedious, there is a story for end users. We need Yahoo in business as an
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:38.400]   independent business, don't we? Obviously, we need as many of these companies. We don't want
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:45.680]   less companies. Right. We need competition. Because you feel that Yahoo's done a tremendous job.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.720]   Oh, they're terrible. But I mean, Google on their. So you know what you're saying Patrick is,
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.960]   they should it's because they have not kept up with Google, whatever they should just be out of
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.720]   business. I'm not saying we should only have two companies. It's the same reason I'm rooting for
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.800]   AMD to beat Intel or at least to compete enough so that Intel has to stay honest.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.520]   Same reason I'm rooting for Apple to compete well against Microsoft just because we need the
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.920]   competition. That's all. Yeah, but now you've given us a reason to care. You know what I mean?
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:22.880]   Because for the most part, I could give a squat about the voter proxy fighting. Yeah, that's what
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.280]   I'm saying is we don't care about the business story. They've already managed to destroy a lot
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.640]   of the morale at the kind. There's still a lot of people who are happy, Yahoo, I'm sure. But
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.560]   you keep reading all these stories about how people are leaving, looking for jobs out,
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:40.000]   because they all feel that they're. I'm sorry. I see they've always been coming and going. You
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.320]   know, it's not like I think these stories are exaggerated by the media looking for something to
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.480]   write about because I've had them got a column coming out in this next week's PC magazine where
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.720]   I bitch and moan about the fact that you know what we've done in the computer business,
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.880]   computer magazine business, the newspapers and everybody in between is that we've focused on
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.800]   one or two things and we beat it to death and beat it to death. And I've always felt that we've
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.920]   written about Microsoft so much during the 80s and 90s to the detriment of all the other companies
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.280]   that all the other companies went out of business and there were no advertisers left and in the
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.520]   magazine. That's a good point. And everybody wants to know the reason why. That's an interesting point.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.800]   Wow. Talk about a great conspiracy theory. It's not a conspiracy. It's laziness. I mean,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.040]   everybody writes about the same thing. And then the thing that really got me the most,
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   and I think Patrick would have to agree with this, at least this cut point, is that people would
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.960]   come up to you when you write for a PC magazine or any of the publications say, "Oh, the only reason
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.200]   you write about Microsoft so much is because they're big advertisers and all the advertisers,
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.240]   they get all the attention." And the point is Microsoft never advertised. They're like one of the
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:47.280]   laziest advertisers they hardly ever advertised. I mean, the other parallel I should say, by the way.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.080]   You know, yeah, but it's like, you know, I look to, I remember looking at somebody once and said,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.880]   "The reason I don't talk more about BSD is because I was approximately 0.00% of our audience. Well,
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.040]   we do something here and there and we show people how to do it. Sure. Am I going to get down and
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.240]   dirty with some of the insider secrets for hacking the BSD kernel?" No, because you know what,
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:10.000]   right now, I think it's like 65, 70% of our audience is OS 10.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.760]   Well, I do mean. Sorry. Sorry. Is what you're kidding? Oh, I was going to say.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.960]   Oh, I know. But that's because we've created the monster. I mean, I'm talking about back in the
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.840]   mid 80s. What's this? We created the monster. We in the media.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.760]   I take no responsibility for creating that particular monster. Actually, I think you are
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.400]   maybe single-handedly responsible for the popularity of OS 10. It's not Steve Jobs. It's not the hard
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:43.120]   word. It's me. It's me. And that's only because they pay you. Yeah. You know, I admitted 100,000
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:48.720]   a month from Apple. It's great. It's been a real gravy train and now that you've ruined it for me,
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.200]   Patrick. You know, you think you wouldn't have had to wait online for a phone. Oh, wait, you didn't.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.920]   Oh, yeah. Mr. LePorte come right up here. We've got something for you.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.040]   You know, now that's going to appear in Valley WAG.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:09.440]   LePorte gets 100 that. Oh, believe me. They don't need much. LePorte gets 100,000 a month from
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.120]   Apple computer. It's not going to appear. Come on, Valley WAG. I dare you.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.680]   Are you upset because you don't have as many articles about you in Valley WAG as Kevin Rose does?
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.720]   Is that what this is? It all come down to personal competition with Kevin Rose for
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.840]   notoriety. It's all about Kevin Rose. All right. Here's here's here's a good one. Here's a good one.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:36.080]   The New York on Andrew Cuomo, I guess Mario's son, right? Andrew Cuomo, New York State Attorney
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.840]   General announced a sting operation, a sting operation mounted by the Attorney General
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:48.640]   of New York State heads has uncovered indifference. This is what they uncovered with their sting
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:54.400]   and oppression indifference on the part of Internet service providers regarding complaints about
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:01.520]   child porn on their networks. They're indifferent and we've got a sting. Can you just back up and
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.080]   bring this and start over on this one? I'm quite following. I had the same reaction.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.680]   I'm reading this from ours. Technica last month. I quote last month, the New York State Attorney
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:17.920]   General, Andrew Cuomo, announced the sting operation at uncovered an indifference on the part of
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.640]   Internet service providers regarding complaints about child porn accessible through their networks.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:30.560]   I don't know how you can have a sting to uncover indifference. You would do that by
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:38.400]   you set up a team. They basically call they put together a list of ISPs and they call saying
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:47.440]   they have seen illicit material. And the ISPs go, or more likely to such an backlog of email
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:53.520]   they never actually get to the complaint. Well, what the result is, and this is where I get a
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:59.760]   little hot under the collar again, is they are persuading. In fact, they got three ISPs to drop
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:08.400]   the entire alt hierarchy on Usenet. Now, this is going a little far. If you ask me, the alt hierarchy
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:14.880]   contains many things, including alt Wesley Crusher, die, die, die. One of my favorite Usenet news
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:21.040]   groups. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff on the alt hierarchy that is not child porn. In fact,
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:27.840]   I would say 99.99%. But I guess they can't figure out where these bad groups are. So they're just
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:34.560]   going to kill the whole hierarchy. It's like chopping off three quarters of Usenet because
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:39.520]   they don't like some of the stuff on it. I think you're failing to take a number of things into
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:46.320]   account here. Number one, that the New York Attorney General's office has become an incredible
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.120]   stick and a political tool. And it was basically, if you take a step back and look at Elliot Spitzer's
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:41:02.960]   by basically going after corporations in the name of the people. Now, you have who? The son of one
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.560]   of the most noted politicians in recent New York history is trying to make his mark. But wait a
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:14.800]   minute, Andrew, who can't get behind? Who cares if a little free speech gets in the way of saving
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.520]   the children? But wait a minute. It gets worse. It gets cut off in the name of protecting the
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:24.080]   people. It gets worse because they've convinced Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of the
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:29.680]   most populous state in the union and Attorney General Jerry Brown to ask the California
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:36.720]   Internet Service Provider Association, SIS, but to also block the alt news groups. Now,
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.920]   there's a big difference between getting a letter from the Attorney General's office saying,
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:47.440]   you guys haven't shut down this potential source, this potentially popular sources,
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:55.200]   and look, let me before the emails start flooding in. I have absolutely no
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.240]   child pornographers should be taking it back. There's no question about that. It's illegal,
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:08.240]   it's bad, it's wrong. I've got kids, I'm not defending them. However, if somebody at an ISP
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.480]   is going, I got the Attorney General ready to beat me into submission and take me into a legal
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:17.200]   fight that I can't afford to pay. So I can protect something that basically was really important to
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:22.720]   me when I started this ISP 20 years ago. And it's basically probably a large amount of traffic
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:29.920]   for copyrighted files. That's it. Well, it's in the old newsnet. And if people are out there using
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.480]   volume, that's great. But I think of an ISP as looking at the bottom line, it's easier to just
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.360]   cut use net off and wait for Cuomo's team to figure out that, hey, you know, what this stuff's
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:47.120]   being sent around on AOL groups. Yeah. Oh, yeah. email. Let's turn that off. And peer-to-peer sites
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:53.280]   and websites. So why don't we just turn off the Internet in order to protect you? Good thinking.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.240]   Now, here's what here's you ready for the conspiracy. I'm all for that, actually. Yeah, cut off the
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.800]   Internet. It's a piece of crap. There's nothing good on here. It's a fad. Here here, by the way,
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:08.240]   Verizon has killed the alt news groups. Roadrunner has killed all news groups. But here's the real
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.920]   story. In my opinion, you want a conspiracy theory, John, for your next column, I don't think it has
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:17.440]   anything to do with child porn. Child porn, as usual, is the McGuffin in this mystery. It's the
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:24.080]   red herring. It's the red herring, the flag they wave because I am convinced that the reason
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:30.240]   honor Chwatsanaga and Andrew Cuomo are going after the alt hierarchies has nothing to do with
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:36.640]   child porn. It's all about pirated movies and music, which also live in great predominance there.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.280]   It's the RIAA. And all they're doing is saying, well, look, you're not going to get the American
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.320]   people to stand up against record piracy. We've figured that out. How about child porn? They don't
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.920]   like that very much. Well, this is isn't this a wonderful segue into the FCC story? Yes, it is.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.680]   You want to go there? We can go there. Let's go there.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:03.840]   So anyway, I just want to point out that in people's, you should contact your ISP and find out
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.560]   they're cutting off basically, they're killing us net by cutting off the alt. And in some cases,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:14.080]   the entire usenet. There are places like Super News and Easy News where you can still get on
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.120]   using that and pirate music and new movies to your heart's content. But your internet service
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:25.200]   provider may not allow that any longer. So you want to talk about Kevin Martin saying that Comcast
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:32.000]   should be reprimanded for blocking BitTorrent traffic. Is that what you're talking about, Patrick?
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.880]   Yes, yes, that they basically have to.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:35.680]   How do you not lose?
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.360]   How do you lose?
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.000]   Is that a phrase agnosto size? Agnosto size, it should be. I like it.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:52.240]   Actually, Martin had to clarify a statement the next day. He gave a press conference.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:58.640]   He's not going to seek a fine against Comcast. He's going to impose reporting requirements on them
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:04.240]   in order to do what they've already started to do, which is to phase out, I guess it's
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:10.160]   Sandvine, but phase out the current traffic management system in favor of a application agnostic one,
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:20.480]   Patrick, for the win. So I think a fine is in order, but at least they're going to try to stop them.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.360]   Do you think they'll succeed?
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.880]   This is the FCC.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:29.120]   Yes. They say this is the federal government.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:38.480]   Yeah, baby. Go get them, baby. You get them. They say this is against the law, basically. It's
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.040]   Kevin Martin says he hopes the action will make network operators sensitive about putting
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.280]   "arbitrary limits on the way consumers can access information on the internet."
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.440]   Finally, this whole debate about net neutrality comes home to roost. The FCC said time and time
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.640]   again, we don't need a law. We'll keep an eye on things. I never believed them, but apparently they are.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:03.680]   I just, you know, I don't hear what I mean. Let me defend these guys.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.800]   Okay. Which guys?
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.320]   Comcast. Oh.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.880]   I don't think it's arbitrary. You use the word arbitrary.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.920]   He said arbitrary.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.480]   arbitrary limits. You think it's not an arbitrary. It's not arbitrary. That's the point.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.760]   They're trying like, oh, let's just limit this guy for no good reason.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.240]   No, you're right. It is an arbitrary. In fact, Comcast says it carefully uses
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:28.880]   limited measures to manage traffic to ensure all customers receive quality service.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:35.360]   And you know what? I hate to say it, but kind of with you on this one, John, I think it's not
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.560]   unreasonable for an internet service provider to try to control bandwidth hogs so that everybody
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:46.000]   gets access. I don't know how you do this, though. I don't know if blind, but you know what,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.320]   they're actually doing, which really does seem like it's going too far, is breaking the connection.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:55.520]   They're sending out packets and saying, oh, we don't need your seed. We don't want it. Go away.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.960]   And I think that's going a little far.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.080]   There's got to be some other ways of doing it. That's for sure.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:06.160]   Yeah. I mean, I think that's really reaching into your computer and saying, because they're
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:12.160]   posing as you. They're posing as the person who is downloading the BitTorrent, and they send
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.000]   the message saying, forget it. We don't want that seed after all. They're closing the--
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.280]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.880]   That's going a little too far.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.160]   Go by. Go by. Go by. Go away. Go away. We don't want that.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.600]   I think application agnostic is basically the idea is that they--
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.240]   Yes.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.320]   I don't think-- I don't think-- Kevin Martin, there's a pretty good link actually in the
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.160]   delicious stories. Kevin Martin basically says, they just want application agnostic.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.880]   They don't care if they want to target high traffic. They don't want to care if they target
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.520]   high traffic. There you go.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.760]   And as people use users, they just don't want them targeting individual--
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.000]   There you go. There you go. That's exciting.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.560]   And I complete-- and a lot of the ISP guys are probably out there freaking, because the last
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:55.600]   thing they want is FCC regulation. But, you know, I don't know. Am I supposed to be excited about
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.160]   net neutrality? Or maybe is this at the beginning of an incredible power play?
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.600]   You know, Kevin Martin, probably at the tail end of his service at the FCC,
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:10.400]   puts the-- you know, plants the flag in the ground for the FCC to start controlling traffic
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.280]   on the internet. Now, that's really spooky to think about. You imagine that.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:21.520]   You mean this could have the opposite impact? I think it's the first net neutrality regulation
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:27.600]   from the FCC, right? Well, what do you know-- I think one of the things that the people would
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:34.000]   like Leo is for the internet to be regulated so that it is just as clean and wholesome a source of
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.200]   information and entertainment as broadcast television is. And you've murdered it.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.680]   You're joking. But in fact, that's often been the opinion of the FCC.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:49.840]   Well, and that's where I-- and that's one reason. I want my Wild West. I want to have to supervise,
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.960]   you know, my child's use of the internet. I want him to know that there's the most
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.280]   amazing source of information on the planet out there. And the dropkick Murphy's.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:03.920]   Well, you know, I've seen, you know, East Berlin and East Germany. I'm not particularly
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.960]   impressed at what a totalitarian society does with the control of information. You know, call
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.680]   me old-fashioned. Old-fashioned. Ask me. You asked for it.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:23.120]   Let me-- there was a big, you know, story in the news this week that I thought was kind of
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:29.600]   interesting. And I don't know how widely reported it was. There's a big flaw in DNS.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:35.360]   It was very widely reported. And it's somewhat controversial.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:41.760]   Well, the interesting thing is a great many DNS servers are still subject to this flaw.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:47.920]   If you go-- there's a website that a guy named Steve Kaminsky created called Docs Para,
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:54.000]   D-O-X-P-A-R-A.com. I'm sorry, Dan Kaminsky. He's with I-O-A. He's amazing, by the way.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.160]   Is he? Have you talked to him? I've actually had a chance to talk to him. I've seen him speak
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:05.120]   at DEF CON. He is a full-on ninja of the first order. He is a-- if you ever get a chance to see
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:11.120]   him speak, he's amazing. He makes DNS sound exciting. Because it is the core of the internet.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.600]   Well, it is. It's the big phone book that you use when you enter a web address. It looks up the
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:22.160]   number, the IP number. And because it's possible to poison that cash, you can get back an IP number
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.800]   for a phishing site, a hack site that could either infect your system or get your passwords,
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:32.400]   all sorts of bad stuff. He knew about this, found out about this months ago, went to Microsoft,
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:38.640]   went to Cisco. This-- by the way, it's in bind. It's in Cisco's DNS. It's in Microsoft's DNS.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:45.040]   It's in a lot of different DNS server software. It's because they don't randomize ports. They
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:51.440]   choose ports in sequence. It makes it possible to do this. He discovered it. They met in March
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:58.800]   at Microsoft's campus to talk about what to do about it. Finally, the patches have started to go
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:04.320]   out. But I have to tell you, if you go to docspara.com and test your DNS servers,
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:09.440]   I was stunned. My Comcast server stills five days later, still poisonable.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:15.840]   It's kind of interesting. I did this on Twit Live and asked the chat room,
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:21.840]   and many, many big internet servers providers have yet to patch their servers, even though this
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:28.320]   has been known about for a while. On the flip side, I wonder how much of that is them not doing it.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.840]   I wonder how much of that is them not believing there's an exploit. I wonder how much of that is
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:38.320]   really them figuring out how do I update the umpteen thousands of routers or switches or whatever.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:44.640]   I have to go ahead. I wrote about this last week and the Friday or or was it not? I don't know.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.240]   It was I don't know when it was. It was this week and market watch you should people should
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:54.320]   read it. It's kind of a layman's introduction. By the way, so I just went to docspar because I
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:52:01.680]   checked my machines and I'm just noticing I just checked it now again. My server, which is Comcast
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:07.200]   stick, by the way, apparently is okay now. Mine was not. Let me check again because it is it isn't
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:14.720]   national. It's it's your local, you know, your regional loop. So yours is okay now. Let me just
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:23.120]   check mine again. Comcast. Mine is vulnerable according to and this is Comcast DSL extreme. I
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:29.040]   have three internet service providers. COVID Comcast DSL extreme. COVID is okay. DSL extreme is okay.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.480]   Comcast is not, but it depends where you are. So you should go to docspara. By the way, a simple fix.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:41.200]   Use open DNS for your DNS settings. Open DNS is fixed. So it's a very simple fix. Just go to
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.720]   opendns.com and use those DNS settings. Put them in your router and clear the settings and all your
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:52.560]   other computers. You'll be using it everywhere. That's what I do at home. But good for Dan Kaminski
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.560]   for we should get him on actually. I think he'd be a good subject person to talk to.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:01.520]   Yeah, I think he would too. I or you put him on security now actually. Yeah. So it says it's
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.120]   interesting here. Can this little listing says your name server blah blah blah with the IP address
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.600]   appears to be safe and make sure the ports listed below aren't following an obvious pattern,
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.800]   which I think is interesting. Well, yeah, that's where the flaw is because these are supposed to
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:18.480]   be randomized ports. Yeah. And the SD does it right, but nobody else does. Yeah, well, this one here,
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.000]   they've done it right because there's no pattern whatsoever. It's just all over the right, you know,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   right. It's supposed to be completely random. The patch fixes that right. It's interesting. I was
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.600]   talking to Randall Schwartz about this when this broke. Randall was in studio with me
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   and he knew about this issue and he said, yeah, the guy behind Open DNS has been saying for years,
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:41.280]   randomized your ports, randomized your ports and nobody listened. And now of course,
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:49.680]   the next split has been created. So I flew back from Seattle on Virgin America or Virgin
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.880]   Virgin America, isn't it great? It's the best. It's like being on an international carrier.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:03.920]   They gave you a I mean, I upgraded to first class and they gave me a like you get like this full
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.800]   meal. It was reminiscent of a Cathay Pacific flight, the kind you take in Asia when you take like,
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:13.040]   one time I took this hour flight, I think it was like an hour between Taiwan or hour and 10 minutes
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:18.640]   between Taiwan and Hong Kong. And it's like, you get like a 10 course meal. And you know, everyone
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.840]   has some bones and bones about you. We don't have time to do anything. You know, who's you know,
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.600]   what you know, what USA or just did they took the entertainment units out of the planes
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:34.240]   because they weigh 500 pounds and they can save gas. So now you've got to sit in your little seat,
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:41.200]   not moving your knees, not eating any meals, not watching any TV, just shut up and sit there.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:46.800]   Unbelievable. But meanwhile, I think, well, the question is can Virgin America succeed? I mean,
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:51.120]   I mean, the fuel costs the same for them as everyone else. Yeah, but you know, that's got to come down.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.280]   Yeah. Yeah, that's going to come up. Well, there's charges are the same as everyone else. So it
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:01.680]   seems to me is that if I'm going to make a choice, I'm going to fly them if the schedule works out,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:06.000]   as opposed to somebody else. They're very amenable. They're very friendly. And I talk to these guys
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   because it's kind of a weird airplane. If you've been anyone who flies in this, like you come into
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   the plane for the first time, first time you see it, it's all purple. Then other words, the lights
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.320]   are black lights. If you have a white shirt on, it's black light. So you think that you're in a
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:25.440]   disco strip club or a Philip Star Hotel, you don't know which if they had a pole with a girl on it,
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.160]   then you know where it was. But anyway, the guys, the steward is they're all wearing black.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:36.320]   Yeah. And so anyway, so I asked one, it's it's it's version, but not black, but not black skirts or
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:41.520]   black, little black dresses, they're wearing black white khaki pants and black shirts, all of them.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.120]   No, this guy's there were wearing black pants and black. Oh, those are the pilots.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.720]   The pilot like Macintosh guys. Yeah, the pilots don't wear pilot outfits. They just wear black.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:55.040]   Okay, they're really cute too. They're very attractive.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:02.320]   And you know, the airline is based in San Francisco. Manly way. So, but anyway, I was very
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.800]   impressed. I would recommend it. I fly it to Vegas because when you get off the plane in Vegas,
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.680]   they have a big sign that says, let's get this. Let's get our story straight. We're all in Cleveland.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:18.880]   And then and then when you get on, they have a disco ball. You weren't far off. They actually,
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.720]   I don't know if they still do this, but they actually had a disco ball in the entry ramp.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:28.480]   It was pretty funny. Yeah. I actually, I actually quite enjoyed flying. Did you,
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:33.760]   did you in first class, you get little, you get a box with like little cups of things, little,
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:40.240]   weird little. Yeah, actually, I probably, yeah, it's it's a you get a funny meal. It's a weird meal.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:44.880]   It's good. There's little wrap. I just did anybody out there who has a choice. If you have,
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:50.880]   if the Virgin America has a route that matches where you want to go, take them. Don't take the
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:55.520]   other guys. And and Ginny, Ginny, Giardin named one of their planes.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:59.280]   Well, now I take it with everything I said.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:05.520]   She needs. Ginny Giardin. What's the story? Did you see this story in Boing Boing?
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.640]   Should we get into this Patrick or should I stay away from it? You know, it's actually,
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.680]   it's a fascinating story. So I don't know what happened, but in the past,
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:23.360]   Ginny, who is one of the three or four contributors to a Boing Boing, including our good friends,
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.000]   Mark Fronfelder, who's been on the show. Corey Doctorow has been on the show. Ginny,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.160]   I don't think has ever been on, but as Ginny had written a number of blog postings about
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:41.120]   a woman named Violet Blue. I know you know her Patrick. She's a well-known columnist in San
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:49.200]   Francisco and a sex educator and frankly, I'm all for that. Everybody needs to know you bet.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.720]   And apparently a very nice person. Everybody I know who knows her loves her.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:57.120]   So, but for some unaccountable reason, about two weeks ago,
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:04.480]   all of the stories were deleted. Any mention of her, it was as if she became a non-violent
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:10.400]   Blue became a non-person on Boing Boing. Several hundred posts disappeared and even posts that
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.960]   didn't disappear that had her name were redacted. And it very eventually Ginny,
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   Jordan, admitted to doing it, but never gave a reason why. I don't know. It's a personal blog.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.160]   I mean, it's their blog. I don't see why they shouldn't be able to do it. It's just a little
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:30.640]   weird, isn't it? Well, it's come up in a lot of it's, you remember you mentioned the CNET story
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.440]   being updated. Yeah, I don't like that. Yeah. Okay, well, stop.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:42.080]   Hold on. Hold on. Do you not like them changing the story to reflect updated information while
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.240]   acknowledging the original story? No, that's okay. That's okay. That's the way. That's where I want
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.000]   to jump in because I want before you finish your thought, Patrick, I want you to consider this.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.920]   The last cranky geeks I did with John Markoff and one of the
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:59:00.640]   Goldstein, a professor of, used to be the head of the J School at Columbia and Berkeley at different
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.600]   times. He just came up with a conversation and it was, I was of the opinion that as far as I'm
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:10.800]   concerned because it's online, it's a different media. You can make on-the-fly changes and he,
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:16.240]   from an old school journalistic perspective, thought that you should only, like for example,
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:21.280]   fight a story that I had some mistaken stuff in there. I should put a line through it and then
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:27.520]   add the new stuff, which is just make a mess. Well, it's, it's, I, okay. Go ahead. Sorry.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:31.600]   I'm with you on this one, Patrick and John Markoff. I do think it's important to,
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:37.680]   because otherwise it looks like you're hiding something. So it's, you're hiding what you said.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.000]   You're saying, "Oh, no, no. Let's not pretend we never said that. Let's do it this way."
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.520]   I think what you need to do is say, "Look, we said this. We made a mistake or we want to fix this or
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.080]   we want to say a different story." But you need to say what you said. You can't just delete what
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:56.320]   you said and say, "Oh, no, the story is this now." Here's where I have a problem. Well, go ahead,
[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.240]   Patrick, and then I'll give you my... There was, there was a, there was a, actually an
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.640]   incident involving a friend of ours who the, the writer did a very interesting interview with this
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:12.480]   person who basically talked about how there was this void, basically that there was nothing
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.440]   to take the void after Tech TV shut down, right? A subject near and dear to our hearts.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:23.200]   Despite the fact that there were all of these online, you know, audio and video shows, you can,
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.920]   you know, Twig, Cranky, Stiel, TV, and, and, and several others that had nothing to do with any
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:35.680]   of the original people that worked at, at, at Tech TV. And the audience went kind of nuts and a
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.640]   bunch of PR people went nuts and a bunch of people went nuts and emailed this guy. And the entire
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:47.840]   story, like a 800 word story was completely rewritten to make all of the original, like quotes.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.480]   Basically it was, it was cleansed. It was like one of those things where you see the picture of, of
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.160]   you know, Khrushchev on, on a panel with four guys and then somebody shows you a picture from
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:05.280]   years later than accident. And it's three guys, no longer part who Khrushchev who?
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:12.320]   And, and it's, it's, people come out of a journalistic background. You know, the thing about the thing
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.000]   that's so different, so many people see nightly news, right? But traditionally nobody ever had a
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.960]   copy of it. So people coming out of a print background, you know, and John, you and I would
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.160]   certainly, you know, qualify as that. I think for a lot of people, especially people who are, are,
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:34.080]   are at the sort of, you know, people who are at the J schools and stuff, I think they, they
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.320]   think they must completely believe that it is, it is absolute anathema to change the original story
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.560]   of record without noting that fact. Now, I can, because, because,
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:50.400]   having said that, I have to say, Boing Boing is not CNET. Boing Boing's a, I don't think Boing
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.160]   Boing's a journalistic entity in the same way that CNET is. Do you? I, I think, I think CNET is,
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.040]   or excuse me, I think, you know, Boing Boing is just as important. I think Boing Boing is a huge,
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:07.120]   I mean, is it traditional journalism? No. Is it a little creepy? I guess I'd say,
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:13.280]   is it journalism at all? I don't think it, it's just a blog. That is the foulest thing I've heard
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:21.520]   you say in weeks, Leah. It's just a foul thing. It's a, it's a, it's a, okay, let me redact that.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.440]   It is just a personal blog. It's, I don't, I, Boing Boing stopped being a personal blog a long
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:34.480]   time ago. It may be the power of their personality, but it is a powerful tool that influences consumers.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.800]   And it's some, and, you know, and it's also, you know, it's certainly subject to the same,
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.520]   you know, libel laws that everybody else is. And it's, it's a, it's a legitimate business entity.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.720]   I don't think just because somebody isn't CNET or the New York Times or Ziff Davis
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.280]   that they are not accountable to the same standards. I don't think I want to go to a site,
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.720]   you know, that's not accountable to the same standards. Is it a little weird that they eliminated
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.640]   all the stories? Yeah. That's strange. I think that's strange and didn't say anything about it
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.520]   until they got a lot of comments. Hundreds of comments of people saying, what the hell happened
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.800]   here? The flip side is what if I'm CNET and I decide that, you know, for some strange reason,
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.920]   or Ziff Davis for that matter, right? You're talking about, you know, a lot of, you know, at one point
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.560]   a few years ago, the Ziff Davis team basically got rid of all of the old reviews because quite
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:25.200]   frankly, who wants to read my review of a, you know, Dell notebook? Well, that's reasonable. That's
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.080]   different. I don't think that's a problem. So what makes that different from, you know,
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.320]   is it because they eliminated everything that it's okay and that they didn't eliminate it
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.280]   selectively? What if they kept, you know, John C. Dvorak's columns going back to, you know,
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.800]   he was writing them on CPM machines, but they eliminated everything else? No, but this wasn't,
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.480]   I mean, to delete entries about a person is not the same thing. It's not like they deleted every
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.200]   entry that was at the same time, made at the same time as that entry. They only deleted entries
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.280]   about her. I mean, something's going on, obviously, and a lot of this. We should be able to find out
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.880]   by our Twitterers. I mean, somebody must know the answer. What's the question?
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.440]   Jeannie has never said why. She just said it's personal. Violet has never said why. Do they,
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.120]   would they? Violet has said that she doesn't know because I was reading an article about this
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.000]   last night. Yeah, she says she doesn't know. And the, and the, and the truth is, is, you know,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.120]   is it a privately held? First of all, first of all, I don't believe that violent knows.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.480]   I mean, you know, well, she must otherwise it makes no sense at all. She must know.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:31.760]   She has an idea. She has to have a clue. Otherwise, it's like weird. I mean, I'm not saying it couldn't
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.920]   be weird, but I know it just doesn't smell right. It's too weird. Yeah, too weird. It would be too
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:42.320]   weird. So I'm finally, I think Violet can be disingenuous at times. I think that she probably has a clue.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.800]   I am not disingenuous. I don't even know what the word means. I don't know what it is.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:54.240]   Okay, so let's get back to this topic. Let me bring up a couple of points in time.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.320]   We have CC, the vaporizing information, the accountability standards of online
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.400]   companies, whether or not blogs are real media or which subject.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.640]   The one about the redacting stuff online in line. Let me just, here's where the conversation
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.800]   where it got started. I did a column a couple of weeks ago where I said that I was bitching
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.520]   a moment about Bill Gates getting all this coverage for his retirement. And I mentioned the great
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.840]   philanthropist and saying, you know, of all the great ones. And I said, like Andrew Carnegie,
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.520]   John Rockefeller and Bill Gates, if they're all alive, at least Bill Gates would be the better
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.360]   looking of the three. And mentioning that, Andrew.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.080]   I'm wondering what's the man. Well, hey, what can I say? So, and I said, mentioning the fact,
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:42.240]   I said Andrew Carnegie had, you know, the worst case of Rosacea. And somebody's right away in a
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.480]   comment, which is the way people do this. You know, they said, no, no, no, wasn't Andrew Carnegie?
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.520]   It was JP Morgan, you idiot. And so I went back and just changed it.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:59.280]   The big red nose was Morgan, not Carnegie. Well, Morgan actually beat somebody, beat the hell out
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.720]   of somebody with his cane for taking his picture. He was so sensitive about it.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.280]   Now if you had a big red nose, you're the man who financially bailed out the United States government
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.200]   and it was that sensitive about a skin condition. Well, it was a bad skin condition. Whatever the
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.440]   case was, I just changed the whole thing so it wasn't even mentioned. And now, and so now I'm
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:21.280]   being told by the professor that, you know, I should have been lined out in the other direction.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.880]   I'm with, I'm with him on that. Why? What differences do you make?
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.320]   What does he not important? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:33.760]   John Greenville. Otherwise people go, wait a minute, am I going crazy? Didn't he say it was Carnegie?
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.960]   Oh, please. If anybody's not on like, remember, remember, John, we're talking about, you're talking
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.840]   about a professor that's dealing with teaching young journalists ethics, right? And if you,
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.560]   if you paint it in broad enough strokes, not bothering to verify your sources and talking to
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.120]   two people who are pissed off in a line waiting for an iPhone is not that different from not
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.920]   acknowledging that you had the wrong name because you did not do your research on somebody's,
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.560]   you know, Rosacea condition. You know, do it, do I think you probably need to do it? Probably not.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.200]   If I'm, wait, wait, let's guess. Okay, let me, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll,
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.600]   I'm talking ahead of pins. That's kind of a different thing.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.680]   Okay. Okay. Let me take it to the next level.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.800]   And this is the way I think things work nowadays. And I don't think this is one of the reasons I
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.400]   don't think in this case. In fact, I don't think you should ever have to, I don't care
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.600]   whether somebody goes back and thinks they're crazy because they thought they saw something
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.280]   that's not there anymore. I don't really care. It's not important. It's not that important. It's
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.760]   not life and death. But let me put it this way. We let you leave the comment in where the guy says,
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.560]   no, it's not JP Morgan is so and so and so and so. And you put fixed. And anyone reading through
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.680]   the comments realizes that something was changed. So what's the big deal?
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.040]   Oh, see, I thought you were talking about just changing out without making a notification that
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.320]   you were, but you didn't notify you didn't say anything in the main post.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.640]   I'm not going to say anything in the main post because it gums it up because every if you want to
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.480]   just start, you know, every day, especially if you have some long piece where there's all kinds of
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.640]   little corrections that can be made. And if we're going to accept the fact that the public is now
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.040]   our editors, which is what we've all been saying, well, then why don't we let them edit. And if
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.960]   they're going to be editing, that means it's a work in progress. Is it ever seen editing before
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.800]   publication and editing after publication, though, it already was published? This this
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:13.040]   also gets. Yeah, and if you're living in the 1800s, when you first century, you can do this now.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.720]   But John, this is that if you were in 1850 and doing a book and you could make changes after the
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.600]   thing was published, instantly, all over the place of 1000 people bought your book and you can
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.000]   change the words in it later after the fact they do it. It really would make people crazy.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:36.320]   Well, Whitman changed every single pressing of beliefs of grass had moderate to significant
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.360]   alterations by Walt Whitman. He kept trying to make it better. The thing is though, is there's a
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:45.360]   slim, I don't know, I don't even think that's a slim poetry. That's not journalism.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:50.240]   Well, you know, it is someday you and I will sit down with an English professor and we'll have a
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:55.600]   fun conversation about that. But the, the, what I'm saying here though, is it's interesting because
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.080]   John basically what you're saying is everything is Wikipedia now. And what the professor is saying
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.760]   is that, you know, the difference between being a journalist or a news organization or a professional
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.160]   media company or maybe there is no difference, right? Because if something is constant, if something
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:15.840]   is never finished like Google Mail, Gmail, it's constantly in beta that basically makes it Wikipedia
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.480]   because the article is constantly evolving. The thing about Wikipedia is you can always go and
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:25.040]   look and see what changes were made at every step of the way. There's no point where something
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.320]   in theory, unless Jimmy Wales is involved. There's no, well, no, that's the point of a wiki is the
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:36.640]   revisions are all visible. And you know, you can dig, I could have my bio on there's been revised so
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.960]   many times I couldn't find two of those revisions in the long term thing. There's just a mess.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.640]   And besides that, who's going to look at that? And I don't think it's important. I think what you
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.480]   want to do is if I have an article on XYZ and somebody wants to look up XYZ, I think they should
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.400]   have a modern, the newest version of that. And this is not like Wikipedia because this is not
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:01.360]   being changed by the public. It's being changed by the one writer who wrote the piece. So there's a
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.600]   big difference there. And I think that if anyone had the opportunity in the past to do this kind of
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.320]   thing, so you're up to date pieces, always the most accurate, I think that they would jump at the
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.240]   chance. I understand what you're saying because you want a bunch of garbage out there. You're saying
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.440]   an aesthetic thing. My position is from the reader's point of view, it makes them a little crazy to
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.400]   have read it one way and then see is another way. And I stand by this. And you know what, I think
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.920]   we could differ on this. I did a blog post in April and I misspelled a word. I said,
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:37.360]   I enjoy pouring over my old posts and I spelled it P-O-U-R and I'm because I'm a literate and somebody
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.560]   said, you know, it's P-O-R, not P-O-U-R. So instead of now, this is taking it to extreme, John, that
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.400]   you probably think it's not. I lined out pouring, but I left it there. Oh, that's stupid.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.360]   And the reason I did it is I didn't want to make people crazy thinking, wait a minute, wasn't that
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:00.320]   pouring with a U a minute ago? What kind of obsessive compulsive idiot is going to go crazy
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.280]   over the fact that you've changed your spelling? Well, the other reason I did is because I had
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:08.080]   accurate. The other reason I did is because there was a comment and so I didn't want to make the
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:16.240]   commenter seem crazy. Oh, I think that's the way to go. But and I admit, that's really a ridiculous
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:22.000]   example and it could easily have gone the other way. But I think in general, I fall down on the
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.400]   side of it. With the program, this is the 21st. But this is nothing to do with what Jeannie
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:34.160]   Jardan did. Jeannie Jardan did. She deleted these posts kind of mysteriously. You think that that's
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.640]   okay too? Well, I mean, don't you think it's the same thing as changing the, you know, as me
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:44.240]   deleting the JP Morgan reference? No, not at all. No, no, no, no. She made a non-person out of Violet
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:52.400]   Blue on my boy. Yeah, that's a big deal. Well, I mean, I made a non-rozation and Andrew Carnegie.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.840]   That's the same. I don't think that's the same. I think that one you could debate. I think that's
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:01.680]   a correction. I think deleting every mention of a person, hundreds of them from a blog.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.080]   Now, now here's where I, but on the other hand, I don't think it's so bad because I don't know
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.040]   if Boeing Boeing is, I don't feel like Boeing is a journal of record. So I don't have the same. I
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.000]   feel like it's a little more personal. Well, well, I know one thing that I don't know what
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   blogging software they're using, but I know for a fact that with some of the some versions of
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.480]   WordPress, if you delete someone who is a member, it deletes everything they've done on the blog.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.280]   Yeah, but it wasn't that wasn't what happened. It was not post-buyers.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.200]   But how do you then how do you even manage? I mean, that seems like a lot of work. Yes.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:37.520]   Precisely. That's why it's weird. It's been really pissed off at some time. She was pissed off.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.960]   And that's why I don't believe Violet doesn't know. There's something went down. Not, and you
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:45.440]   know, the truth is most of this is salacious. If it weren't two attractive young women,
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.240]   I don't know if anybody be caring about this much. Would you and me, John?
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.360]   Oh, I'm sure there would be most of that. That's about time he did that to that guy.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.320]   Here's an interesting question, right? To elevate this away from the salacious.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.560]   Although I don't think it's that salacious compared to what shows up on, you know, access.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.120]   Yeah, there are more salacious things in the world. I agree.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.440]   You know, is what constitutes a journal of record in the 21st century?
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.560]   Because part of the whole idea is of having a journal of record or whatever your localist.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.560]   And it gets interesting, right? Because, you know, the the origins of what always cracks me up is
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.600]   when people are like newspapers or supposed to tell both, you know, I mean, it's the whole idea
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.240]   that newspapers are not supposed to be opinionated. But this is why this discussion is so important.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.720]   Yeah. Was to actually basically push the viewpoints or the political or ideological beliefs of the
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.040]   publisher or of the, you know, whatever.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.640]   William Randolph Hearst.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.840]   William Randolph Hearst or, you know, the, you know, the, the, the,
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.920]   gosh, I can't even name it. There's, there's, I mean, there's so many newspapers that don't
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:51.200]   exist anymore. They were all about representing the point of view of a particular group of power.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.160]   The press belongs to the guy who owns the press.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.720]   Exactly. And that was, that was why a lot of people owned presses. But, you know, the whole thing
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.280]   is those you, you, you, you archived your print copies. You had them in a library and they were
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.600]   always available as a record of what was said.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.080]   I want to take a little break. I think this is a great conversation. I really think this is the
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.360]   kind of conversation that has to happen. There's no obvious right answer. I think,
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.000]   I think it's very interesting though.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.600]   Well, let's, I'll tell you what we can follow it up. We don't need to beat it up. And I want to
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.840]   write about it a little bit anyway, so I can get my thinking a little more straight. But I think
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.720]   we should look into the, the, the, why this, this expulsion took place. That's kind of interesting.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.560]   It is interesting. I'm very curious about it.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.560]   And I don't see anybody on Twitter giving me anything. I got another complaint about you again.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.120]   Me? Yeah. What do they say?
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:44.000]   We want to keep Leo and check about the iPhone. You're the only realist there. You and Patrick.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.520]   That's why you're on, man. I knew you'd be the invited Molly too. I thought I'm going to get
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.400]   three people who hate the iPhone on and I'm going to be all. I don't hate the iPhone. I'm just in
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:15:00.800]   between iPhones because my baby, you know, you drool. There are people who hate the iPhone
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:06.080]   so much that they would do anything. It's, if you ask me, there's a little more bias on their side
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.000]   to be honest with you. It's time to take a break and talk about audible.com or find sponsors who by
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:19.760]   the way sponsored the entire Diggity Danged 24 hours of iPhone and gave me 10 iPhones to give
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:27.360]   away, which I did. And I just think they're the greatest and I thank them for that. Audible.com/twit
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:32.160]   if you want to get a free audio book. This is my next book. I haven't read it yet, but I just love
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:39.040]   the name Snoop. What your stuff says about you. Sam Gosling is a psychologist for the last 10
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:45.520]   years. He's been discussing studying how people project their inner selves in their public world,
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:52.320]   desks, bedrooms, clothing, cars, and what they say about us. Imagine just think about it the last
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:57.840]   time you wanted it to somebody's cubicle and the weird stuff they had on their walls. This is what
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:04.960]   that's all about. I can't wait to read this. I love freakinomics. I loved unpredictably rash
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:10.080]   or predictably irrational and whatever it was. And I can't wait to read. I love this kind of stuff
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:16.320]   where the true story is teased out through whether it's through econometrics or psychological research.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.200]   When it comes to the most essential components of our personalities, the things we own and the way
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.320]   we arrange them often say more about us than even our most intimate conversations. John,
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:31.360]   maybe you better clean your office before you read this. I need to clean the office. Put that
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.520]   on the list. Snoop, what your stuff says about you. On a bridge, Sam Gosling read it. It's a BBC
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.440]   audiobook and it's yours. Absolutely free if you go to audible.com/twit. 50,000 titles.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.200]   I just I was up there and they gave me some interesting stats. For instance,
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:54.720]   more than half of all their books are played back on iPods according to their research. However,
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:59.600]   a surprisingly large number of played back, I thought you'd be interested in this Patrick on
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:06.720]   GPS devices. Really? Are we talking about iPods per se or MP3 players? No, no, iPods per se. Let me
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:13.360]   see if I can get the exact stats because they 52% of their customers are iPod owners. The ZAN
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:18.960]   and the SANS are big as you would expect. It's only 52%. Even though iPods are about 80% of the market,
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:28.080]   but if you give me a percentage, but they said the number four device is our GPM,
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.360]   Jess's Garmin's and Tom-Tom's. But if you think about it, they're in your car, they've got speakers,
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.760]   they've got little SD cards. It kind of makes sense. So anyway, whether you're working out or
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:44.480]   driving, obviously commuting is big. Five, get this from the University of Texas. Five on the average.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:52.080]   The average commuter spends 530 hours in the car every year, 530 hours. If you listen to audiobooks
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.600]   during that time, just think how smart you'd be. Audi- oh, audiobooks are the best from Audible.com.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:03.120]   We thank them so much from their support and invite you to visit Audible.com/Twit today.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.600]   So, and in fact, I think I sent both of you guys Audible accounts, right? You finally got yours,
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:15.680]   right, John? No, you never sent me anything. You make, yeah. I got the one you sent me. I sent
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:20.240]   you one. And we... Maybe I'm in the spam box. I'll check that. I think what we did is we took
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.440]   your account and we made it a comp count. But John, you don't get spam. How could you know?
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:32.320]   Obviously, I don't get Leo's memos either. But... Well, I'll resend. How about that, Mr. D?
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.880]   Yeah, guys. You know what? The thing is, it's not necessary that I didn't end up in the spam box.
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.920]   I've been, since I've been traveling a lot, I've been letting stuff slide down the thing,
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:45.440]   down the list. And then when I've done this with a couple of people and I do a search on them,
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.240]   and there's their mail on open that I... Oh, man. When I did that 24 hours on the air,
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.480]   that means 24 hours of not answering email, you'd be amazed how much email can pile up.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:19:01.520]   You don't read it every day. Holy komoly. There's a picture of JP Morgan and his rosacea
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:07.200]   knows just in case anybody wants to see it on twitlive.tv. It looks kind of like you, John.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:14.160]   Okay. How can that be? I don't have a rosacea. No, you don't have a... You got to be all
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:18.720]   packed. It's horrible to get that. You know, it wasn't W. Didn't WC Fields have rosacea?
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:24.800]   Yeah. But that's gave him that look. Yeah. Well, now they have medicine you can take for it,
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.760]   you know, and it's just a bacterial thing, right? Well, it's like a virus or something. I think
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.320]   it's weirder than that. A lot of women get it after being pregnant or having a couple of kids.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.080]   Oh, that'd be terrible. You're talking... No, it's just that it turns out it starts as rosy
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.000]   cheeks and you look at your rosy cheeks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you have to take an
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.160]   antibiotic for it and it knocks it down and then, you know, and you fight it for the rest of your life.
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:53.520]   People, by the way, according to Twitter, just can on Twitter, the iPhone lines in New York are
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:20:02.080]   still five plus hours today. It's the Jesus Phone Part 2. What does that tell you about New Yorkers?
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.960]   Yeah, actually Portland and a few other cities have gotten emails from people or
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:12.240]   Twitter. It was interesting because when we started the coverage at a 10 in the morning,
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.920]   there was nobody in line, nobody in line, even at midnight, there were just a handful of people
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.520]   in line in New York City and then they all came like at five and six o'clock at night.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:25.200]   They all showed up later. Jason Calicanis gives up blogging. Does anybody care?
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:30.560]   Jason does. Does he blog? Jason's audience, guys.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:38.000]   He made a little bit of coin in the blog business.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.440]   It's interesting that he's giving up blogging. Yeah, I mean, Weblogs Inc.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:46.480]   made him a lot of money, sold it to AOL. He says he's going to do something a little more intimate,
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:53.120]   a newsletter. And once the subscription, he's got 600 subscribers now, once it gets to 750,
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:21:00.000]   he's closing it off. He's up to something that guy. I don't know what.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:09.600]   I don't know what's here's the some, some one of the my fabulous Twitter army sent me a link to
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.800]   this LA Times article about the apparently is in the LA Times, at least in the blog section,
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.280]   Web Scout about Violet Blue. Oh, what do they say?
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:27.760]   It's apparently there was some personal relationship between the two that they were good friends,
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:34.240]   I think. Yes. I guess, but they don't have the specific fallout. Why does it matter?
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.560]   Because it's juicy. That's all because we got nothing else, Patrick. We got nothing.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:45.040]   Well, if that's the case, I better read this in. Jason Calicanis stopped blogging.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:50.720]   Yeah, you think you're right. I think you're right. How about the, the,
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:58.960]   the blogger who is living in a garbage truck, Angelia? Actually, it's quite a nice garbage truck.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:04.080]   Actually, it's beautiful. I want to live in this garbage truck.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.160]   All right, never mind. Too many jokes there. I can't.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.920]   I was off cutting the Xbox 360 price. Oh, how much?
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:17.120]   One gigabyte Xbox 360 is $299. They've launched the 60 gigabyte model says ours Technica.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:23.760]   Ooh, the iPhone sales projections are in and hold on. I think it's going to be bigger or as big as,
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:29.040]   let's put it this way, as big as last year's surprise for everybody. And it's, it'll be,
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:33.440]   you don't see, I want to see numbers for like what percentage of the market is now controlled between
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:40.080]   between the last I saw it was only of the smartphone market, 45% blackberry, 19% apple. It was a
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.120]   surprisingly small percentage. What, what percentage? Yeah, my next question is what percentage of the
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:50.480]   phone market is the right? Because smartphones are a fraction of the phone market.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:57.040]   Hold on. I'm waiting for this story to load and it's refusing.
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:06.560]   Don't worry. We'll just edit this all out. Dude, it's going to really only be like a 10 minute podcast.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:20.880]   Do you make it for dinner tonight? I've got some, some beef short ribs that came from one of the
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:28.720]   animals that we've, we buy animal off the hoof. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute,
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.600]   wait a minute. I'm envisioning your backyard looking like some scene out of apocalypse now.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:40.080]   Do you have a ranch, John? No, but when you live in Port Angeles, you have a access to people that,
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.240]   you know, grow a few animals and then they split them up. When did you get fresh?
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:49.760]   I got a place up there, but you're not there now. Not at the moment. Okay. I was there yesterday.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.840]   But do you bring meat back with you from? Yeah, it's hilarious to get it through the TSA.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.960]   Sir, what is this? It's a rump roast.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:06.080]   I'll bring a suitcase full. No, no, wait a minute. No, really? Yeah. A suitcase full of meat.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.800]   What else I got to bring? I got to put some on the plane to get my money's worth of this shipping.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.440]   Sure, Mr. Riser, just get right on the plane. No problem. Actually, haven't you see the,
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:21.120]   if I've actually come back from, from airports like in Montana and Wyoming and had people loading
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.480]   coolers filled with dry ice and, or coming back from Alaska with, with coolers full of salmon.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.960]   Yeah, I met some guys flying up to Alaska. They had three coolers filled with beer.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.040]   They said, yeah, we fill it with beer. And when we come back, the beer is gone and it's full of salmon.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.560]   We had some great salmon over the weekend. You know, we get this that we get the Indian salmon.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:45.440]   There's a bunch of, you know, Native Americans up there that fish where you can't normally fish.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.240]   They have access to some of the best fish. Oh, man, I can't even eat salmon
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:56.960]   anymore unless I have the real, you know, the natural real salmon out in the wild is small.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.440]   Because it just doesn't, it tastes, I mean, this is delicious in the salmon you buy,
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.400]   especially the farm to crap is so horrible. It turns in, you know, that white melt comes out of
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.680]   it when you cook it and it stinks. Ah, well, it's also killing off the wild salmon.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.640]   Right. We thought it was going to save the world. And it turns out this farm fish is actually not good.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.560]   Yeah. Now they find tilapias got issues. Where?
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:25.600]   To lap. That by the way, is the title of the show today. Tilapias got issues.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.800]   That'll pull them in. Engagit has pictures. Blackberry is not sitting back on its laurels
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.160]   with regard to the the iPhone. They've got the bold coming out that later this month,
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:43.120]   which is a very nice looking, it's the new newer version of the operating system. Very nice black.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:48.000]   And Engagit today published pictures, first ever pictures of the thunder.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:55.200]   Oh boy, they're bringing the heat. This looks a lot like an iPhone, but it's a blackberry. Touch
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:02.320]   screen, keyboard goes sideways. Looks very sweet. Big screen too. Not a lot of buttons on it. I
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:08.640]   think blackberry is is being very aggressive about saving their market against the iPhone.
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.000]   I don't think they're, I don't think they're saving their market. I think I agree with Patrick's.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000]   They're preserving their market. But again, this comes back to what we were saying.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.600]   It's great to have the competition. And I think that's where the iPhone has really stimulated
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.000]   the sell market. We're starting to see some, finally some decent. I mean, remember before the
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.640]   iPhone came out, everybody hated their phone. Everybody did. There wasn't a good phone. What
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.120]   did you? Oh, you had that weird big button phone. No, I don't have a big button phone. I use
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.920]   burners that you throw away. If you don't like it, you toss it. And how often would you toss it?
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.400]   I toss one about once every couple of years. So wait a minute, John, let me get this straight.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.800]   You carry burner cell phones and big cartons of meat.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:54.400]   I don't know how you get into the country. I don't understand. He doesn't leave the country.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.720]   Port Angel is close to Canada, but still in the United States. Well, that's even worse. It's like,
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:03.520]   oh, yeah, right by the border. One time I was down in New Orleans, and I was in one of the things
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:07.840]   I liked. There's a couple stores that have a really nice fresh and dewy and some of the other
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:13.600]   sausages. You can't get them anyplace else. And so one time I decided on the way to the airport,
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:19.440]   I stopped at this place and loaded my suitcase up with Louisiana sausages. I'm sorry, sir. You
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:25.200]   can only carry three ounces of fresh sausage on the plane with a quick stick. So the guys, the TSA
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.840]   guys just got the biggest laugh out of it because one of the guys decided to play a prank. Oh, oh,
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.240]   he says, we got, you know, check this out. And got all the guys over to look, you know, they open
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.960]   up the suitcase filled with their local sausages. And they all thought it was so funny. Oh,
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.120]   Lazy Le Bonton Rule, baby. Undo e.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.560]   I tell you, French quarter, John, you might have had a marte.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.880]   Most good sausages are they freeze. You can freeze them and they doesn't affect their quality.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:00.160]   No, they get better with age. I don't know about that. All right. Well, I know one thing,
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.760]   this podcast is not getting better with age. I think it's time to wrap it up.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:10.560]   John C. Devorek is at devorek.org/blog CBS market watch. Don't forget tech five and
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.720]   Joe Jones market watch, Leo. Sorry. Oh, bad. My bad.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:21.760]   Dow Jones market watch tech five. Cranky geeks. What is that other one you do with the
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:28.160]   curry fella? No agenda. No agenda. And the Twitch show with Leo Le Port.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.320]   I've heard of that. I haven't listened to it in years. It's really lost its edge, I think.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:36.720]   No, I think it's improved. They got Patrick coming back.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.800]   It's like andouille's sausage. You could freeze it, but it doesn't get bit there.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:47.440]   Mr. Patrick Norton is the star of Tekzilla, which is the top show on revision three. He also does
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.120]   system. And now you can watch him produce the show live. I was watching live the other day.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.640]   In fact, we missed each other because I was watching you. We were watching on Twitch live.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.680]   We were watching Tekzilla in a strange meta moment. And I called your phone, but you didn't hear it.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.080]   And then you called me, but I'd already moved on and it was too late.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.800]   It was so well, I got all these people started posting.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.480]   Yeah, I know Leo. Leo wants to talk to you. And of course, my one's not.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:16.400]   I got to tell you, what will happen is people say what I was saying about you. And they try to
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.440]   stir up trouble between you and me. I've seen them do this before. I wasn't saying anything
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.720]   negative about you. I said, boy, I'm relieved because they're using big gravity. And I had a
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.120]   tough choice between stick am and big gravity, big gravity, big gravity's pitches, how great their
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:33.040]   quality is. And I was relieved that it didn't look so much better than our stream.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:37.440]   That we also don't have the super cool guy stream. Big gravity can do some
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.920]   problems. Oh, they can do that. But that's anybody can. That's the point is that you turn up the
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:47.200]   bandwidth. It's all flash. You turn up the bandwidth, you get better and better. That's all about how
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:51.280]   much bandwidth you wanted to vote to it. But anyway, that's all I was saying. I wasn't dissing you. I
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:56.160]   was just saying, Oh, I'm relieved. I figured if you wanted to diss me, you do it to my face or at
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:03.600]   least fight, you know, I love you. But I would never be eating my own. Huh? I am. I am. Yes. And
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:09.120]   you and I am you suck. I am. I said. I think that's what Neil Diamond was actually talking about.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.920]   And no one there. Okay, you're right. The show is deteriorated into a mess.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:20.000]   Quick side note, you haven't mailed anything out. Have you are post office has been giving us
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.120]   other people's mail again? No, I'm when I in fact, when I mail a check to you, I won't mail it to you.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.920]   Hand carry it to your home. I'm probably willing to come up there. I just come up. I just want to
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.720]   be we've we've had a bunch of it's it comes and fits and spurts and we're in one of those stages.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:40.080]   I know that feeling. Yeah. Well, I just like check when if you come up that basically,
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.080]   that's what John had to do. I had to come up to get his money.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:49.200]   And it's stand over me and say, Where's my money? It's a dirty trick, but you enjoy it.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:56.240]   I can't not write you a check if you come up. I don't back up there again. I think as a pleasant
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:01.840]   drive to be honest about it, it is. And we gave you a paté and fine wine, a giver. Yeah, people
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:06.480]   moaned about that by the way, they complained they kept hearing me dropping forks and chewing.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:12.320]   Well, chewing. It was a line in chewing. Yeah, we have next time we'll feed. We'll feed before the
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:17.600]   show. Now we could we just have to be more careful. Take a field trip in Sun Farms and learn how
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:22.320]   John can start actually slaughtering his own calves in the future. So yeah, let me get this
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:29.760]   straight. So you actually buy a live animal? No, you don't eat live animals. You buy a share
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:34.640]   of a live animal and then they slaughter it? Like a half a steer, a half a pig,
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:40.640]   some half a sheep or a whole one. In fact, we buy a big box of meat that represents. No, no,
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:47.200]   but it's not meat yet. It's before it's meat. Well, yeah, it can be. It depends most on the hoof.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:52.240]   There's a guy, he says, hey, we got this steer. We're going to butcher it in March.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:57.840]   You want a piece of it. Yeah, and you can take half of it or quarter of it or all of it depends.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.240]   And it's like cheaper and better in the quality. There's no comparison. You can see why people use
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:07.520]   grass meat. It's grass fed. I don't know about grass fed. Grass fed is not always the best.
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.960]   You know, it's delicious. If I cooked you some of this meat Patrick,
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:16.640]   no, no, John, John, I am just as Epicurean snob as you can be. He's from Missouri. He's had
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:21.920]   a lot of there's a lot of mediocre grass fed beef. This may be magnificent grass fed beef, but
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:26.240]   buying grass fed beef is not a guarantee. Yeah, no, I agree with that. This is a lot of it has to
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:31.760]   do with the breed of the animal and all kinds of things. You know, does it have a name? Bob.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:40.320]   It's always Bob. We're having we Bob tonight. We saw some of them. Some of them do have names
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:44.480]   that we had one Bruno. And in fact, when we had when we pulled the meat out of the freezer,
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:51.200]   it's like, what is this? This is a Bruno's flank steak. Bruno was good. Bruno was very good.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:55.520]   Actually, Bruno was good. Fine. A lot of hiccupologists will do this. I think we just lost all our
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:00.320]   vegan listeners. And they're a healthy portion of the audience. And they're healthy.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:04.160]   Well, they're not healthy. That's the problem. Steve Jobs is no longer listening.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:08.720]   But no, actually a lot of agricultural colleges will do that. They'll sell off. Basically,
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:13.600]   they sell off the students final project. Right. We're all, oh, I love going to the fair because
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.800]   you got the 4-H kids who are really in love with these kids. I mean, it's kind of sad. They're really
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.560]   in love with these animals. And then they have to take them to auction. Well, where you are Leo,
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:25.040]   it's a surprise to me that that's oh, do you buy off the hoof? No, no, we don't buy off the hoof.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:29.840]   We don't eat meat. We're vegans. That no, we don't buy off the hoof. But you know,
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.560]   we probably could. But I just don't want that much of Bruno. If you have a freezer,
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:39.200]   you just throw it in and you're good. Good to go from. I don't want to be eating the same name
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:45.280]   for months. I like the different. Sometimes I want to sell. Sometimes I want to Tony.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:51.760]   I don't always want to Bruno. This is really unique. Stop Leo because take it out of context.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.120]   This is going to sound so rough. Yeah, no, I got, I'm clipping that one. That's going on the
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:07.520]   check five show. Ladies and gentlemen, another twit is long in the can. Whoa, hold everything.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:14.160]   Just before we went to bed with the show, we got a hold of Wozniak. He's in Vegas
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:20.800]   for a conference and he agreed to talk to us briefly about what actually happened in the line.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:28.320]   Hey, Steve, thank you for joining us. So the reason the reason we wanted to get you on to it and the
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:34.320]   reason and we talked a lot about it on to it is and I was incensed, frankly, by the article and
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:40.240]   seen it that implied that you somehow jumped the line because we had talked to the early
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:45.520]   to drive to Las Vegas, woke up at five and I saw it right on scene it. And I remember this little
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.400]   scene at reporter strange, strange character. And I was there early. He knows that I was there
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:56.240]   from I went to bed at midnight. I woke up at two forty five, you know, basically sleepless and
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.680]   came down to the mall. But I had arranged things that I was going to come down at 10
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:03.360]   stand in line. They said, no, no, no, Steve, no, no, we've got it all arranged. They're from
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:06.720]   line. I said, no, I don't want to pass up other people because that's how I am. And they said,
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.280]   Oh, no, no, they want you to the people in the front of the line want you to be ahead of them.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:17.600]   Right. I remember you. I stood by you. I was on that blog. I remember you. You told me that.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:23.280]   You told us that. I said this comment on the Cnet list. If you go down to the second page,
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.960]   yes, I have a post in there that I wrote this morning just before driving to Vegas.
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:31.360]   And you know, I went to the people in the front of the line. When I got there, I saw four people.
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.400]   It could be there were some wrapped around a corner that I didn't see
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.320]   some more, but they said it was a short line. And I went to those people and you know, they said,
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:42.320]   yeah, they were okay with me. I was chatting with the guy. I actually made the guy who was
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:47.680]   first in the line there before me go in, walk in first and get sort of the good camera publicity,
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.160]   that sort of stuff. You know, he kept wanting to know, no, no, no, you're the big man. You do it.
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.640]   Come on. You know, you were there first. And I try to do that. I do not like people who cut.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:00.960]   I know executives that will get products in advance that will arrange a little black door,
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.760]   back door, you know, push out of the audit early. I could actually make phone calls and probably get
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.000]   an iPhone, you know, before anyone else, a lot of different ways. But I won't do that. I want
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.800]   to experience, I waited there from four in the morning till whatever. Now I had made arrangements.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:22.000]   I have a herniated disc in my spine and it's hard for me to stand for long periods. It messes me up.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.760]   Right. And so I arranged that I could actually use the seats that were in front of the Apple
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:30.320]   Store. Right. And the Apple Store staff, the manager on down, said, oh yeah, that's fine. We'll
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:35.040]   have that reserved for you. And that was all done in advance. So I sat there and they and not in the
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:39.440]   line, they thought I sort of just maybe just showed up and cut into the line. But that wasn't the case.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:46.000]   I'd been there all from four AM on very early on. And now a couple people came with me that were
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.960]   there at two AM. And one friend showed up right at about opening time and I didn't love that. And
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.760]   he stepped in. But I'll say, when I went over to the line, they said, okay, it's going to start.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.840]   You come over because you're first. I went over to the line and, you know, said, well, you know,
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:03.440]   you guys really should go ahead. I mean, you were here. And they said, no, no, no, we want you there.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:08.000]   And I said, well, how about my people, my group? Oh, yeah, yeah, they go with you. Instantly,
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.760]   it was the mainly the Apple store manager and staff said that. And I felt a little bad about
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.520]   one person who just showed up late and really hadn't waited hours for it like I had. But you
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.720]   know, it was a long, long wait the whole time. It wasn't as long as the last one. Yeah, the last
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.440]   one, you know, waited from, you know, from four AM on through the hole next day. So that was a
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.640]   little tougher. And but no, no, no, I, you know, and I definitely, if there were some people that
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.320]   besides those, those four people that were okay with it, if there were some other people wrapped
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:44.560]   around, you know, 10 other people or something. And some of them, one of them is offended. I'm very
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:50.160]   embarrassed. I'm apologetic. Maybe, you know, but this when you have the store, people say,
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:55.120]   yes, it's all okay already. Before I came down, they said, what's all okay? We've got it, you know,
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:59.440]   arranged for you. And we've talked to the people who are in line. I have a recording of you from
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.520]   the night before saying this. So this is such a dinky thing. This is such a dinky thing. They love to
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.880]   just trash me and trash me. You know, it's like the time that I said they dropped the price of the
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.760]   iPhone too soon. I said it two weeks after Steve Jobs, but they accused me of trashing Apple.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.000]   You know, I get Lord Apple had already given you a hundred bucks back in American Express,
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.360]   another 200 for it. And then I said one time I said, well, should the Apple, I should the phone
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.480]   have 3G a year after it was introduced, year after it was actually for sale. And I said,
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.960]   it was just recently. And I said, yeah, should have 3G. Of course it should. And they said,
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.440]   I was trashing Apple. Good Lord. Steve Jobs said it was slow on edge a year before. They don't even
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:41.440]   read the technology news or something. It's like, you know why they're writing it. They're just writing
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:45.840]   it for sensationalist headlines. And you know, they think, Oh God, this will sound good and
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.680]   over and sell. People read the headlines, you know, and you know what? It's happened to me
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.920]   enough times. I don't really doesn't really bother me. Well, I wanted to set the record straight.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:59.040]   So there's certain it turns out that really the gadget sites, a couple others like Wired
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.480]   seen it are the ones that are the worst at trying to build these little tabloid stories.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.800]   I know. Oh my gosh, there's something real.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.880]   I think they didn't know and turn it into weird. Well, you don't have anything to apologize for
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.480]   it. I think everybody agrees. It'd be fine if you wanted to jump line anyway.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.760]   Next time I'll go down to the Los Gada store, wherever, you know, this store actually wrote,
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:25.760]   I was going to go to my Los Gada store in my town. This store wrote me an email and they implored me.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:33.120]   And then they I had to go off to speak to a web 2.0 conference and a video that day. So I was out
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.000]   and they were talking to my assistant, I think, and set everything up. And they wanted me. They
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.520]   absolutely wanted me to come to that store. So I said, okay, instead of going with my friends
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.560]   down to the Los Gada store, me and my friends decided we would go to the Valley Fair store.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.280]   And it's like they were the ones that were important. I didn't go and say, oh, can I come up and have
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:55.920]   an early place in wine? Not at all. Steve, thank you so much for your time. I'm going to let you go
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.000]   to dinner. I wanted to clear that up. We're going to put this into it so everybody can hear what
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.840]   really happened. Because as far as I'm concerned, you're one of the great guys in the business,
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.280]   not only for your contribution, but just because you as a human being are a great person and I
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:10.480]   just made me mad. So I'm glad we could get back to you. Thanks. Like you, this one.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.080]   Yeah, I'm an engineer and I'm honest and I won't distort the truth and the facts.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.520]   I know. That's what we like about you. Thank you, Steve. Have a great night.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:30.960]   And I actually just picked up a flat of moss. I've never been so excited about plants and the
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.920]   layer of moss. You are getting so domesticated. Oh, I've always been domesticated. It's just,
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.520]   you know, nobody notices the fact that my towels are, you know, properly folded in the hospital
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.160]   corners and I know what the pile of panels are too busy going. Why is he howling black flags?
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.120]   So he skips down the hallway to the studio. So here's the deal. I'm just trying to get the
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:56.320]   thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens like forget it. I'm killing you.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:01.200]   Round the morning.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:09.600]   Do the twin. Do the twin. All right. Do the twin, baby. Do the twin.
