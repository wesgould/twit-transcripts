[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.760]   It's time for this week in Tech.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.880]   Twit, as it's known colloquially around the Geekosphere.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.680]   Leo Le Port here, and joining us to talk about the week's tech
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.080]   news.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.320]   Adam Curry from No Agenda, NoAgendaShow.com.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.480]   Howdy, y'all.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.680]   Isn't that the-- what are those?
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.080]   The scary words you'll ever hear?
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.120]   I'm here from No Agenda, and I'm ready to help.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.920]   And we're here to help.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.400]   We're here to help.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   That's right.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.960]   That would be your government.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.840]   Oh, yeah, them.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.920]   Oh, yeah, them.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.560]   Adam is ready with his rain stick.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.840]   So everybody be nice, also here with us from New York
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.880]   and The Verge, Nilei Patel.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.200]   Nilei is an attorney, but also one of the great writers
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   at The Verge, one of the founding editors at The Verge,
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.200]   and been covering the Samsung Apple
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.520]   trial.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.680]   We'll be talking about that and using his expertise,
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.160]   because he's also a lawyer.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.840]   That piece of paper comes in handy all the time.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.040]   You don't practice, though, right?
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.280]   No, I haven't practiced in years.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.040]   But you passed the bar.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.560]   I did.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.000]   I'm on the bar in Wisconsin and Illinois.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.920]   So you could if you wanted to?
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.040]   I could, but I definitely don't want to.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   I don't blame you.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.920]   Do you know how people's paperwork is not fun?
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.160]   Covering the trial is fun, but that's being part of it,
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.920]   not fun at all.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.880]   Well, and having some expertise in the law,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.920]   because what sometimes seems like common sense to us,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.160]   unwashed lay people, is really not how the hell it works
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.320]   at all.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.760]   No, it's nonsense.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.720]   Especially when it comes to this patent stuff.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's pretty nonsense.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.880]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.160]   Well, good.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.920]   We'll get into that in a moment also
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.120]   with his father, Robert Balliser.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.920]   So we can get the Holy Ghost involved.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.600]   Yes, I am a Catholic priest, but also like Niela,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.960]   I no longer practice.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.640]   He's got it down.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.160]   He doesn't have to practice anymore.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.280]   But I've been told if I should pass away
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.160]   during the show, you can perform a treat on your shit.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.640]   I got you.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.240]   You got me.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.360]   I got your back.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.080]   So actually, the topster will lead off
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.000]   with a story that is not Apple's Samsung, shocking to everybody.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.840]   Yesterday, Niel Armstrong passed away
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.360]   the first person to walk on the moon at the age of 82.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.880]   Adam, do you actually believe that he walked on the moon?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.920]   I just should check probably before we talk about this.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.160]   Well, I have to be honest that I do not believe
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.680]   that he walked on the moon.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.960]   Because I was right screwing that landing.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.640]   Good call.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.120]   OK.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.800]   I hate to say it.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.080]   And unfortunately, he took the secrets of that
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.400]   within to his grave.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.320]   Well, Buzz Aldrin's still alive.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.000]   NBC.com posted a story where they said, first guy
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.840]   to walk on the moon, Niela Young passed away.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.280]   They were the first with the story.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.760]   And I guess sometimes typos happen.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   These people make a lot of money to do that.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.680]   Wow.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.720]   I had a lot of--
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.120]   I was out at a bar yesterday.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.560]   And I heard a lot of people wondering
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.520]   if it was a Lance Armstrong who'd passed away.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.120]   There was a lot of confusion.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.440]   It's really, really depressing stuff.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.080]   Well, the good news is I'm sure there'll
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.360]   be quite a few documentaries.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.480]   And people will be talking quite a bit about it.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.520]   And I think as we begin our exploration of Mars,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.400]   it's really good to remember back to Niel Armstrong
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.160]   in those first words.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.760]   Yeah, that's another one I really don't believe in, Leo.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.840]   You know, if you put a picture of what the curiosity
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.200]   Mars Rover has taken, which always
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.760]   seems to take pictures of itself,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.720]   you put a picture of that into Google.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.560]   The Google API will say, would you
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.240]   like to see other pictures from New Mexico?
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.160]   Well, it looks a lot like New Mexico.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.000]   All right.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.320]   Admittedly, admittedly.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.000]   Regardless of whether or not you think we landed on a moon
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.840]   or the curiosity landed on Mars,
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   you have to admit that the effect of inspiring a whole generation
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.680]   of scientists and people interested in space,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.720]   that's a good thing, right?
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.800]   I mean, even with all the other--
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.200]   I wouldn't say Adam has to admit anything,
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.720]   but let's ask him.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.120]   Well, no, it's nice to get people's imagination rolling,
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.960]   and I like all the 3D renderings that we saw of the sky crane
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.240]   and the parachute and the landing.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.880]   Of course, we never really saw any of that.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.200]   We just saw the 3D renderings.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.880]   They were beautiful.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.400]   Well done.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.040]   The seven minutes of terror, I'm impressed.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.480]   You really don't believe what would be the incentive
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.360]   for the government to--
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.920]   or NASA to fake this?
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.240]   Oh, just more money.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.360]   It's a tiny bit of money compared to air conditioning,
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.640]   the troops in Afghanistan, for instance.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.320]   I mean, really, it's a few billion dollars.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.520]   That way.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.200]   You know, I've put a lot of work into the moon landing,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.880]   and there's just a lot of different theories
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.120]   about how that would work if you can get through certain parts
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.880]   of space to actually get out that far.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.000]   I'm just not wholly convinced.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   People call me a crackpot, so be it.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.920]   I have to really keep to my guns on this one.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.880]   I'm really just not completely convinced.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.360]   I am dragging pictures of--
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.280]   from curiosity.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.920]   And I'm not getting new--
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.360]   I'm not getting new Mexico yet, but I'll keep doing it.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.080]   Now, Adam, let me get your input on this one.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.560]   I got accosted by a few YouTube users
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.800]   who are trying to convince me that the Mars we see in the sky
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.200]   is actually just a big inflatable place there by the government
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.760]   so we don't actually know where Mars is.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.080]   No, no, no, I'm not on that tip.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.600]   I mean, I actually--
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.520]   there are bases on the moon and on Mars, not necessarily ours.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.560]   And who knows what the ultimate agenda is?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.160]   You can Google Project Blue Beam.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.280]   That may be one.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.160]   There's a number of different theories out there.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.920]   So it's hard for me.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.400]   If I haven't seen it with my own eyes,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.240]   I have a hard time believing things.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.360]   I can respect that.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   I choose to believe it because I think it's cool.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.960]   I think it's cool that we walked on the moon.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.600]   I think it's cool we landed a rover
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.280]   with a huge, complex sky crane thing that ditched itself
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.480]   into the recycle bin.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.920]   But I totally understand.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.720]   I mean, if you actually broke it down
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.440]   and considered all the technical achievements
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.200]   that needed to be made to get us to the moon and back,
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.320]   to get a rover to Mars, it really
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.760]   could be considered science fiction even 10 years ago,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.640]   15 years ago.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.640]   So yeah.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.640]   Well, it bugs me then.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.800]   It's interesting.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.400]   Now we have these--
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:23.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.120]   Go ahead, Nila.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.800]   I was just saying, I saw a tweet from somebody
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.560]   that said it took 66 years from the Wright brothers flying
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.040]   at Kitty Hawk to Neil Armstrong walking on that moon.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.760]   That amazing.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.200]   Which is no time at all.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.040]   Yeah, well, you know what's depressing, of course,
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   is if you think about it, it was 46 years ago
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.680]   that he walked on the moon.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.640]   And we haven't backed.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.160]   We haven't been back.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.640]   So pretty soon, that number is going to even be more significant.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.600]   All right, well, we'll move on.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.400]   We'll agree to disagree, Adam.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.080]   No, that's cool.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.800]   What is interesting in all the reports,
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.400]   there is actually almost no picture of Neil Armstrong
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.680]   walking on the moon.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.120]   He took most of the footage, if you would believe
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.240]   that he was there.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.800]   It's all Buzz Aldrin.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.240]   Right.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.040]   There's, I think, one picture of Neil's butt,
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.800]   where it kind of like a half shot.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.040]   And then there's one from some top shot,
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.760]   but all these pictures of the guy in the spacesuit
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.880]   and the dark sky behind him.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.760]   That's all Buzz Aldrin.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.400]   None of that is Neil Armstrong.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.640]   Well, you know, sometimes happens
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.760]   that Neil was the shutter bug and Buzz just, you know.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.520]   Buzz was having fun.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.600]   Well, astounding to see how many news reports show
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.240]   that picture of Buzz Aldrin.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.880]   Right.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.080]   Well, I don't know what to make of that.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.200]   Let's talk about Apple versus Samsung.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.240]   Maybe we can--
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.760]   Oh.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.480]   Is there-- do you believe there is a product
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.440]   called the iPhone, Adam Curry?
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.280]   You know, OK.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.320]   So you can make fun of Neilio.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.680]   I'm actually very jealous of Niall because--
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.320]   I would love to be a lawyer.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.040]   And I looked into it.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.880]   I thought maybe at an older age, I could still do this.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.440]   But it's a lot of work.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   You got like seven years and you have to do--
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.440]   You've got to go to school.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   --a print of ships.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:58.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.680]   It's kind of a drag.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.520]   And ultimately, it's a pretty dull job.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.120]   I mean, I went to law school at the University of Wisconsin.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.360]   It was-- I had a lot of fun.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.760]   Yeah, party.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.000]   So just for those of us--
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.600]   It's a good time.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.400]   Those of you who did not know this, shockingly--
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.160]   we were preparing for live coverage
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.800]   of the Apple Samsung verdict.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.960]   Sometime later this month, maybe in September,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.000]   shockingly, the jury came back after mere three days
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.800]   of deliberation on--
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.600]   there was almost three weeks worth of trial,
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   109-page jury instruction from the judge,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   a 20-page, 33-question verdict document.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.400]   And apparently, the jury just went into the jury room
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.680]   and said guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, check, check, check.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.720]   What do you think it's worth?
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   I don't know, billion.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   And came back.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.480]   Nailette, were you surprised how fast the jury came back
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.080]   with that verdict?
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.200]   I was very surprised.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.560]   I thought it would be this next week.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.800]   I thought it would be the 31st, I think, is--
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.720]   They obviously wanted the weekend off.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.120]   Yeah, but you know, they--
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.280]   I think what they just-- what they talked about--
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.040]   and the jury has now talked a little bit
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.080]   to the Wall Street Journal to see that to some other people--
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.560]   I think what they did was they asked themselves--
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.720]   not we're going to answer these 33--
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.600]   it was actually 700 individual-- more than
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.560]   700 individual decisions they had to make in these 33 groups.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.840]   But they're not lawyers.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.320]   And the jury is not supposed to be lawyers.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.520]   I think they asked themselves not, let's
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.400]   answer these technical questions, but did Samsung copy Apple?
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.360]   And once we make that decision, and once we decide
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.880]   that Apple's patents are valid, then it's really
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.440]   easy to fill out the form, right?
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.720]   Then you can say, well, does this phone have bounce-back
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.840]   scrolling, which is one of the Apple patents?
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.360]   Yes.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.760]   So you just mark yes.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.040]   And then it's easy to pick up 28 devices and say, does it have it?
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.720]   You could do that in 15 minutes.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.440]   So I think they spent their two days arguing about that.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.560]   That seems to be what they did, the first day and a half
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.720]   or so they argued, did the prior art that Samsung
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.000]   show invalidate the patents?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.640]   OK.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.440]   Does the evidence show that Samsung deliberately
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.720]   tried to copy Apple?
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.720]   So Apple did a good job representing that evidence.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.040]   In particular, they were convinced by the emails
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.840]   from Samsung executives saying, we've
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.120]   got a crisis in design.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.640]   We've got to respond to the iPhone.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.960]   I mean, that was damning evidence.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.440]   And I always-- there's a lot of Samsung's response to that
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.240]   was this is what every company does.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.280]   But they never produced the document from Apple
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.200]   saying, we have to respond to the Samsung.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.320]   So the jury looked-- they did their job, right?
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.080]   They looked at the evidence as lay people on a jury.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.160]   It's a jury of your peers.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.840]   And the peers are just the people from the community.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.200]   And they said, this is the evidence we looked at.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.560]   We made these decisions, and we're
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.960]   going to check the boxes.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.040]   I think they got a little--
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.520]   I think once they decided that Apple had won,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.600]   they blew through Samsung's case against Apple pretty quickly.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.040]   So they ruled that Apple didn't infringe any of Samsung's
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.040]   patents, which to me is a little--
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.280]   some Samsung's patents are about how you connect to 3G
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.040]   networks, and Apple's phones clearly connect to 3G networks.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.320]   So unless you're like an electrical engineer or something,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   I don't know how you make that-- it's A to B and logic.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.240]   So I don't know.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.400]   They didn't answer the antitrust questions
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.960]   the other stuff that was presented to them.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.000]   I think they said, Apple won.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.680]   We're going to tick the form.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.200]   And then they said, Samsung lost.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.240]   And so Samsung lost its entire case.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.160]   The one big victory Samsung had--
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.600]   and I think this is a little kind of under-reported--
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.240]   is that none of its tablets were held to infringe
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.440]   the iPad design stuff, right?
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.480]   So Samsung has been saying, you can't patent a black rectangle.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.640]   You can't have exclusive ownership
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.840]   of this black rectangle device.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.080]   It's ridiculous that you're saying the iPad
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.560]   is the de facto black rectangle.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.880]   And the jury agreed with them, right?
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.720]   They said these Samsung tablets that
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.280]   look a lot like the iPad don't infringe on its design pad.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.480]   And I think that is ultimately a big victory for Samsung.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.440]   It comes next to it.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.120]   They won that battle.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.040]   They lost the war.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.000]   But they did win that battle.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   But we did the jury do its job, because we found out
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.800]   that almost immediately they reduced the amount of the awards,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.000]   because the jury had awarded damages for devices
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.080]   that they had determined were not infringing.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.000]   The tablet, in fact.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.760]   Yeah, a tablet and a few of the phones.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.720]   So they had to go back and say, oh, yeah,
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.680]   we awarded 100,000 for this and a million for this.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.040]   Oh, and we had ruled that it wasn't infringing.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.680]   So it seems as if--
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.520]   I mean, maybe they made the unconscious decision that, yes,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.960]   Samsung did infringe, and then they just went down
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.320]   and forgot which phones they had agreed to penalize.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.120]   It's a little sad.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.040]   An opinion here?
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.120]   Sure.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.400]   As we established, I'm not a lawyer.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.560]   I have been sued under the Lanham Act.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.080]   And to my understanding, this was initially
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.920]   a case of trade dress, which is a part of the Lanham Act.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.800]   And correct me if I'm wrong, obviously.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.560]   So under the Lanham Act, the entire idea
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.520]   is if the consumer can become--
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.040]   if the consumer can reasonably become confused
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.160]   by the product service, et cetera,
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.040]   that may or may not be infringing,
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.320]   then that pretty much clears it up for everything.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.200]   And it was much less under really specific patent law.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.520]   But they looked at the iPhone with the bezel
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.960]   around at the original iPhone from 2007,
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.400]   then looked at the--
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.600]   what is it, the 2000--
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.960]   The Galaxy S, I think, was the one.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.520]   Galaxy S was the one.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.040]   The bezel, except for the name when it's not on,
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.680]   but even when it was on with the icons, which I believe Apple
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.640]   doesn't have a patent for, you can--
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.120]   Wait, so let me stop you.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.000]   Let me stop you.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   So yeah, so the Apple does have a design patent
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.280]   on the grid of icons.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.400]   That was-- they called in Susan Care,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.040]   who designed the original Mac icons, who now works
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   at Facebook.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.400]   Not the rounded icons, or it is for the icons.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.200]   It's for the grid of icons.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.160]   Actually, at this point, I know the patent numbers
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.000]   off the top of my head.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.400]   It's the D305 patent is the design patent
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.000]   on the grid of icons on the iPhones home screen.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.840]   So Apple presented this huge case, this monster case.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.760]   It was trade dress like you're saying.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.760]   It was a collection of design patents,
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.000]   three or four design patents, and then three iOS software
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   patents on pinched--
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.920]   not pinched to Zoom exactly.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.120]   It's knowing the difference between--
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.440]   Tapped scrolling and pinching.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.800]   Yeah, tapped to Zoom.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.480]   And bounce back scrolling.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.080]   So it's this monster case.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.720]   So you're right, there's this whole big trade dress stuff.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.320]   And the specific thing the jury had to decide
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.200]   was not, does this infringe the trade dress?
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.000]   Are consumers likely to be confused?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.600]   But does this dilute the distinctiveness
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.640]   of Apple's trade dress?
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.120]   So the value of the iPhone--
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.520]   Apple's saying the value of our brand and the iPhone look
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.080]   is-- people know it.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.960]   They see this product.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.920]   They know it's an iPhone from Apple.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.400]   Now, Samsung flooded the market with all these other products.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.920]   Does that dilute the distinctiveness of our design?
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.640]   And the two big factors--
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.520]   Apple-- the two main factors that the case focused on
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.560]   was Samsung's intent to copy the design and actual confusion.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.640]   And so Apple leaned hard, obviously, on intent to copy.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.280]   They showed these documents.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.880]   And Samsung leaned hard on, you cannot tell me
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.760]   anyone's actually being confused in the market.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.320]   And I think that--
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.960]   And I think that's something you said for both ways.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.480]   Yeah, those are-- there's what?
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.720]   It's five or six factors, and those are the two
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.720]   that were most at play in the case.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.680]   And I think, ultimately, the jury decided
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.280]   that intent to copy trumped actual confusion.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:38.800]   Right, Samsung--
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   That's why I said ending--
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.320]   That's precedence there, is it not?
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.520]   No, I mean, those are the factors.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.680]   So if this gets appealed and all this stuff,
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.720]   then it will become precedent.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.480]   But for now, it's just a very powerful jury verdict
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.600]   that Apple can point to.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.120]   It's not quite the law.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.320]   Nielai, what was the name of the icon expert that Apple brought in?
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   Susan Care.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.320]   She said that she was waiting in the waiting room,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.240]   and she had this phone and this phone,
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.080]   an iPhone 4s and a Nexus next to each other.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.120]   And she accidentally reached for the Nexus
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.480]   because they looked so alike.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.520]   Are you kidding me?
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.200]   Are you--
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.560]   Well, they do.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:11.840]   Unless--
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:11.840]   Well, they do.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:11.840]   Unless--
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.800]   I'm somewhat alike.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.600]   Well, they're both ovals.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:15.760]   One's a lot bigger.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.200]   Yeah, and it's crowded.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   Seriously, I mean, this is the thing I can't get on--
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:19.840]   Well, this is the thing I can't get on--
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.520]   Well, this is the go back to the iPhone, the original iPhone,
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.240]   not the four.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.800]   The 3G, yes.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.880]   And Samsung, Galaxy, yes.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.280]   Wait, hold on.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.000]   You're holding-- those are different phones.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.720]   You've got an iPhone 4 and Galaxy Nexus.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:28.720]   Right.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.080]   Right.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.560]   Well, this is one of the phones that actually did fall under.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.840]   This is the 2, the G2.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.320]   This actually was in the list of--
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.440]   But it was the 3GS that they said it could--
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:39.800]   Right.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.480]   I mean, come on.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.560]   You're going to confuse this for 3GS?
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.440]   Which phone is that?
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.520]   This is the Galaxy 2.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.720]   This is the T-Mobile T989.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.800]   That's the Vibreity Simmer.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.480]   Yes.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.800]   That phone, I believe that phone, the Vibrant
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.400]   and the Fascinate on Verizon were deliberately engineered
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.640]   to look as much like the iPhone as possible.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.520]   Maybe not even at Samsung's behest.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.520]   But I think the carriers knew they didn't have an iPhone
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.240]   and they needed something to compete.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.760]   So yeah, I do think that there is--
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.400]   again, one of the big factors is intent to copy.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.560]   And I think there was a huge intent to copy
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.360]   to say to consumers, this thing is an iPhone.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.760]   It was just as good as an iPhone.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.240]   Pamela Jones--
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.480]   I totally agree on that.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.960]   Pamela Jones writing in Grock Law
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.080]   said that this $2 million error where the jury awarded
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.760]   Apple $2 million for inducement on a patent
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.160]   that they, in fact, had determined
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.120]   that it was not infringing is going to undercut
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.440]   the jury's decision.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.120]   And she says, this is why I don't think the jury's ruling
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.800]   will stand.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.440]   Do you agree, Nilla, that this could--
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.840]   at least maybe on appeal.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.360]   I don't think Judge Coe's going to overturn the verdict.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.800]   But on appeal, this could be a problem.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.840]   We're going to see a flurry of motions now.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.720]   I mean, Samsung has to decide what places to attack.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   And the appeals court will decide what arguments to hear.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.360]   So we'll see how that shakes out.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:04.080]   But a lot of this criticism of the jury
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.520]   is lawyers who are mad.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.560]   And Pamela's great.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.240]   I'm not saying that this is--
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   her criticism is valid and they did make some mistakes.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.160]   But there's a lot of lawyers who are mad
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.960]   that the jury isn't lawyers.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.760]   Because these arguments are fascinating.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.560]   And I have now spent a month dissecting them in detail.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.480]   Because to me, there's all this legal rambling
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.120]   and interpretation to do.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.800]   But the jury isn't lawyers.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.320]   Their job is not to be lawyers.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.680]   Their job is to say, here are the facts and evidence
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.000]   that were presented to us.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.640]   And we're going to decide what happened.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.600]   And so, yeah, they made some mistakes.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.640]   The judge-- this is the reason the judge had them read it.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.360]   And then she reviewed it and sent them back.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.840]   Because she knew she anticipated that it would make
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.000]   some mistakes.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.480]   And particularly when it comes to damages,
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.280]   it's nine people in a room who have no training in this stuff.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.960]   Especially given how fast they work,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.640]   you might think that they just made up those numbers.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.600]   Aren't the damages supposed to be not punitive,
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.040]   but reflect the actual commercial costs
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.960]   to Apple of Samsung's infringement?
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.400]   It's a hard thing to determine.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.720]   And certainly not in three days.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.320]   It's a combination of what the reasonable royalties Samsung
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.360]   would have paid if they'd licensed the patents,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.280]   plus Apple's lost sales plus all the stuff.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.760]   And they heard from just a variety of competing experts.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.600]   We're going to pay for some accounts to stand in front of you
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.240]   and present some paperwork to you and say a bunch of numbers.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.200]   And now, pick who you think is right.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.800]   And I think what they did was they looked at Apple's sheet.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.840]   They said Apple won.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.240]   They looked at Apple's sheet of numbers.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.040]   And then they cut most of them down to get to whatever
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.600]   their final number was.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.320]   Apple was asking $2.5 billion.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.640]   They got a little more than $1 billion.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.960]   I love that we're now at a place for $2.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.640]   It's not a big deal.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.120]   It's just a little big deal.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.600]   And the judge could, by the way, because it's punitive,
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.040]   damages could-- because they were
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.960]   inducing could triple these damages, right?
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.360]   Yeah, so it's a willful infringement.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.360]   Willful.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.200]   So the jury decided that Samsung had willfully infringed
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.000]   the patents.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.440]   And the elements of willful infringement,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.880]   we've been talking about it at the verge a little bit.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.680]   The elements are-- one of the big elements
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.800]   is how the Samsung's legal team did.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.400]   Today basically wastes the court's time.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.720]   You can punish Samsung for willful infringement
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.440]   if basically the goal is to make people settle.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.200]   So if the jury finds willful and the judge
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.440]   is mad at the lawyers for pushing a case forward,
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.200]   they should accept--
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.320]   in this case, we've been saying, the judge has really
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.120]   wanted Samsung and Apple to settle.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.680]   So we'll see how she lands.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.160]   She could triple the damages.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.920]   That's the maximum.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.280]   I don't think she'll triple it.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.960]   I think she will adjust the damage number a little bit.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.360]   With these types of multi-billion dollar lawsuits and awards,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.200]   why aren't we seeing this in other industries,
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.960]   like the fashion industry or the automotive industry,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.440]   if it really is about initially a design patents?
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.880]   All the time, every industry.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.920]   It's underreported, right?
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.000]   Because it's not as sexy.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.160]   But any time there's a major breakthrough
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.480]   or a major set of innovations, there
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.560]   is a lot of shake out of--
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.040]   Like a sneaker?
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.360]   The sneaker companies all sue each other,
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.200]   the car companies all sue each other for trade dress.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.240]   This is going on all the time.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.800]   We just don't know about it.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.400]   Yeah, pharmaceutical companies and each other.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.320]   And each other.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.480]   Let me ask Adam, what do you think?
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.000]   Do you think that Apple lost money because people
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.800]   thought they were buying an iPhone when they were buying
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.600]   a Samsung phone?
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.880]   Do you think people really were confused?
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.080]   Yeah, how much money they lost?
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.600]   I don't know.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.160]   But to me, yeah, I think that the judgment is correct.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.760]   I mean, how you calculate the award is another thing.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   But yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.120]   And even thinking back to the--
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.000]   And now I was in London, and someone actually sent me
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.720]   an iPhone because you couldn't get them.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.680]   It was like a year later, right, before you
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.240]   could get in Europe.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.560]   And there was a huge trade, actually, in iPhones,
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.160]   in those early days, on lock, et cetera.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.840]   And I remember kind of the marketing.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.600]   Even if you walked into--
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.200]   we had these mobile phone stores in the UK.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.160]   You'd be like, oh, you might-- well, this is just like it.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:05.720]   Look at this one.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.560]   This is beautiful.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.640]   Because they would actually-- well, I mean,
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.320]   SAMHSA is not responsible for how the salespeople do it.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.880]   But they were saying, hey, it's the same.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.040]   It's the same.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.800]   Buy the Z.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.760]   AirGo consumers were possibly confused or duped,
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.040]   or it is just as good as, or as just like the iPhone.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.280]   Right.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.880]   You can't make that argument unless you have something that--
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.520]   you can't say this is just like an iPhone,
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.280]   and then show somebody a kangaroo.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.440]   You know?
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.920]   That would be different accent.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.960]   You've got to show them--
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.960]   yeah, it would be a different accent.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.520]   You've got to show them something that reasonably
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.360]   is like the iPhone.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.280]   And this I'm saying, I think particularly
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.800]   with some of these phones, the Verizon Fastnet-- to me
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.680]   is the example of Verizon didn't have the iPhone.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.000]   They needed to compete with AT&T and the iPhone.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.240]   They got SAMHSA on to make their phone look as much like the iPhone
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.360]   as possible.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.640]   And SAMHSA got dinged for it.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.680]   I think SAMHSA is come a long way.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.320]   I think they're not doing it anymore.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.040]   The Galaxy S3 doesn't look any like an iPhone.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.320]   So in many ways, it's like, I don't
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.040]   think we're going to see this level of activity again.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.880]   I don't think Apple's ever going to have it as good.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.480]   That's what Matt McCarry on our team, who is a patent attorney,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.400]   has been saying.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.960]   Apple's never-- this perfect storm of events for Apple
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.720]   is never going to occur where SAMHSA is actually
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.520]   copying the iPhone's design.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.040]   They're actually in stores saying to consumers,
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.640]   by this it's just as good as.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.080]   The phones look just the same.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.040]   The software features are just the same.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.800]   And what's hilarious is that when people see my Galaxy Note,
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.880]   they all say, what's that?
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.680]   An iPad?
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.960]   It's crazy.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   It's so confusing.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.800]   I'm confused.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.280]   It is.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.360]   Actually, I think that this is a perfect example of the fact
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.120]   that SAMHSA has now moved on.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.480]   I mean, the Note is clearly not an iPhone copy.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.280]   I mean, it's huge.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.800]   It's 5.3 inches.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.640]   And the iPhone's 3 and 1/2 inches.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.880]   If anything, now Apple might copy the SAMHSA.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.800]   Let me-- I thought the most interesting take on this
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.040]   was Farhad Manju writing in Pando Daily, saying that, in fact,
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.800]   this was a business decision on the part of SAMHSA,
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.480]   that when the iPhone came out--
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   he said, actually, the real crux of it
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.240]   was in the fall of 2008, when Apple
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.280]   became the most profitable phone manufacturer in the world.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.200]   They'd only sold 4 million iPhones.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.280]   They'd made $1.3 billion compared to number two Nokia,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.920]   which sold 113 million phones and only made $1.2 billion.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.000]   And when that flipped, when Apple's iPhone
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.320]   became that profitable, companies had to say, this is it.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.360]   We've got-- we have three choices.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.760]   And he gives you the three choices.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.160]   One was, do nothing.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.960]   He says, a lot of firms opted for this path.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.400]   Nokia and RIM, for instance, seem to have decided
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.920]   that the iPhone was a blip, a childish device that
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.120]   would never reach mass appeal.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.320]   So why bother and take-- yeah, obviously, that doesn't work.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.960]   RIM is practically out of business.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.000]   And Nokia's struggling now becoming a Windows phone company.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.320]   He says, another option was try to leapfrog Apple.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.920]   You could spend many months, maybe even years,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.400]   working on devices that aimed not just to match
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.040]   the iPhone's innovations, but to beat them.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.680]   That's what Palm did with the pre.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.640]   Yeah, how that worked out.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.880]   And that's what Microsoft did.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.000]   And three years later, Microsoft phones ships
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.040]   and is, in fact, innovative.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.680]   Clever, but it's three years late, right?
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.240]   He says, then there was a third choice.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.880]   You could just copy Apple.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.840]   You could borrow the iPhone's key IDs,
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.560]   make a half-hearted attempt to dress them up in your own brand,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.720]   and bake them into your product line.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.240]   And he says, in effect, this was a business decision.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.680]   Samsung probably expected down the line
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.840]   they'd be paying a fine to Apple.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.120]   They'd be compelled to license.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   Maybe they'd be compelled to change the design or the technology.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.800]   But for the time being, that was a risk they were willing to take.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.520]   And maybe that billion dollar or $3 billion fine
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.200]   is just the cost of doing business.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:57.000]   They have, in fact, made $21 billion since then on their phones.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.280]   Yeah, but you know what's--
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.280]   Farhout's great.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.280]   I mean, that's a great piece of that.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.440]   I think this is a really good take on it.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.880]   He might be right.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.280]   But there are some huge clutch, like,
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.320]   omissions from this piece, which is that copying Apple
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.440]   didn't work out so great for a whole host of other companies,
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.040]   right?
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.000]   Well, if you're going to copy, you have to do a good job.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.520]   HTC does a great job of making it sound phones, right?
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.760]   Yeah, and they're not doing so well.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.200]   Why not?
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.680]   They're doing really poorly.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.800]   Dell tried to make phones that ran Android
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.600]   that looked a lot like they did completely failed.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.120]   Sony struggling for years to compete using Android.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.600]   Samsung was in a really--
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.040]   Samsung is a unique company.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.360]   I don't think the lesson here is copying works.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.960]   I think the lesson here is a little bit more subtle.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.640]   It's-- Samsung had the resources because they're
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.160]   this dominant manufacturer.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.120]   And they were given this gift of Android from Google, right?
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   And they were able to put it together
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.480]   and immediately start mass producing copies of the iPhone.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.000]   Or devices that were substitutes for the iPhone
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.480]   in many ways and for many customers.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.440]   That is a hugely unique situation, right?
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.200]   And so they were able to make that business decision.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.160]   But all these other companies, LG makes a lot of stuff, right?
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.560]   Their phones are not as good.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.000]   And the customers don't want them.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.280]   And they're-- the joke for me is always Samsung copied Apple.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.560]   LG's sitting there desperately trying to copy Samsung.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.160]   It's not as good.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.680]   It's generational loss, right?
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   It's signal.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.920]   It's really weird.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.560]   If you're going to do it, you're going to do it right.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.800]   And I mean, you can't copy.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.400]   You have to steal.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.640]   I remember there was someone in the Silicon Valley
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.080]   who used to say that.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.360]   And I think his company--
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.560]   As they've done for new jobs.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.000]   Well, you know, the thing about that quote--
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.360]   and I think what-- there's a subtlety that quotes you, right?
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.640]   It's a good artist copy, great artist steal.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.960]   What you steal is not the idea.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.520]   You steal the inspiration.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.440]   You steal the essence.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.440]   You steal the spirit of that problem, that solution.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.480]   And you make it your own.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.840]   That's what stealing really means in that case, right?
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.680]   They didn't steal the Xerox user interface.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.880]   They didn't copy it and ship it.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.120]   They said these are the ideas that we want.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.840]   We're going to steal the entire spirit of this product.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.000]   We're going to do whatever we want to it and make it our own.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.200]   But the copying works.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.600]   Didn't they?
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.560]   Because I mean, the spirit of the iPhone was it made all other phones
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.560]   look boring.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.240]   It made them look so blah.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.320]   It made them all look like the same functionless squares.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.080]   In a way, Samsung's done that to Apple.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.120]   I mean, yeah, OK, iPhones still sell by the millions.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.240]   There's no doubt that they're making a mint off of them.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.080]   But you look at them.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.960]   What are the really exciting phones out there?
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.880]   It's not the iPhone 5 because, well, OK, it's going to be a bit bigger.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.640]   It's going to have all the same functionality.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.080]   It's the next note.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.360]   It's the next galaxy.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   They're really sexy phones.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.520]   And they do things that you can't do with iPhones.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.360]   That's stealing the spirit of what--
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:44.720]   What happened?
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.720]   Oh, sure.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.360]   I think Samsung got there.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.320]   I think they're there now.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.000]   I think they have learned their lesson.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.120]   I think in many places, their execution can struggle.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.400]   But they understand what the task in front of them is.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.240]   What I'm saying is that just saying copying works
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.720]   as a business decision is--
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.480]   I think it's-- you're looking--
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.280]   there's a forest and trees metaphor here.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.560]   It's more than just copying.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.120]   And there's the right company to the copy.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.320]   All of these companies.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.920]   Android had to exist for Samsung to pull this off.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.520]   And without Android, it couldn't have gone.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.640]   Which begs the next question.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.120]   Why didn't Apple sue Google?
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:23.760]   I don't know.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.120]   I've been asking that question for a long time.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.760]   And right now, they're technically
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.960]   in some litigation with Google.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.280]   Actually, Google's suing them.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.760]   Motorola's suing them.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.040]   Through Motorola.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.120]   We'll see how that shakes out.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:43.960]   But I think Apple ultimately was most angry, not about Android.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.640]   This case is not about just Android.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.760]   Boy, you wouldn't think that reading Steve Jobs quotes
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.840]   in the Isaacson biography, though.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.200]   Maybe this was just Steve Jobs' legacy thing that had to happen.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.520]   Well, the job said, though, that we're
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.680]   going thermonuclear war against Google, not Samsung.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.080]   It's like Google copied us.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.720]   Google ripped us off.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.800]   Right, but it's a Samsung products, right,
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.160]   that actually shipping gets sold and are the competitive threats.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.760]   I think, ultimately, Apple and Google
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.440]   have to license it out.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.920]   They have to stop this.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.160]   Apple has a lot of money, and they can afford the lawyers.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.600]   But they're still got to pay for the lawyers.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.000]   And you can't be Tim Cook and say, all right,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.120]   we're going to spend $100 million a year in lawyers.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.560]   That's a lot of employees.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.520]   That's a lot of talent.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.360]   That's a lot of development.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.560]   And they have a really great deal with Microsoft.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.320]   They have a patent cross license that says,
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.200]   we won't clone each other's products.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.920]   I think they can get there with Google.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.360]   And if this is the sort of victory that they need--
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.760]   Maybe this is the catalyst, do you think, to a deal?
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.720]   Yeah, to walk into a meeting and say, look, Google, you can--
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.320]   It's time to just pay.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.280]   It's time to make this happen.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.200]   We'll see if it happens.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.040]   Supposedly, Apple said to Samsung $30 of phone,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.960]   is that accurate, you think?
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.280]   I think that was their opening.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   We have a lot of slides.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.240]   And this is another sort of thing that's
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.080]   underreported about this case is, yeah,
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:06.200]   there's all this Steve Jobs trash talk in the past.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.400]   Apple is the most valuable company in the world.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.840]   They're run by rational people.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.800]   They're not run by the emotions of somebody who's gone.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.720]   And there are slides.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.680]   We've published the slides.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.400]   It says, Apple's saying to Samsung,
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.680]   we would have preferred that you licensed our patents.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.640]   And here's a price.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.280]   And Samsung said, well, that price is too high.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:30.760]   And obviously, they couldn't achieve a price in a negotiation
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.200]   that was suitable to either party.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.920]   But I think that number has come down significantly
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.720]   since the initial $30.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.560]   I think it's pretty obvious that in the future, Samsung
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.160]   can appeal this for all they want.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.240]   But what they really need to do is start paying the appropriate
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.080]   license fees to Apple and end all the litigation around the world.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.640]   I mean, this is just one lawsuit.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.320]   There's lawsuits in Australia, Germany, South Korea.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.600]   There's another lawsuit in a few months over the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.520]   Samsung can't keep risking this domino effect of lawsuits
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.520]   going against them.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.280]   And I think that the smarter move for both parties
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.800]   is to end all the litigation, do some sort of cross-license
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.480]   worldwide settlement, and move on with making products.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.120]   And I think that's kind of what everybody wants them to do.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.640]   Neil, I got to ask, if you look at the judgment
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.560]   and you look at the patents that were ruled to be infringed,
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.360]   how many of those translate directly
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.040]   into what we would call the Google Android experience?
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.120]   So when you look at, say, the Samsung Galaxy S3,
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.320]   how many of those could be used against the current crop
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.200]   of Android products?
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.680]   It looked like for the most part they did not find against--
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.720]   they were finding against Touchwiz, not against the Google
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   experience.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.840]   They can't run this lawsuit anymore, right?
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.360]   I mean, they'd have to come up with an entirely new docket,
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.920]   and then entirely new set of complaints for them to continue.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.000]   Yeah, I mean, you can't--
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.320]   Apple pays its lawyers too much to have them cut and paste
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.920]   the complaint from the leader of that.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.440]   So yeah.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.880]   We'll write a whole new one.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.080]   They'll come up with some new arguments.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.840]   But yeah, I've heard from a few people
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.920]   that Google thinks the newest version of Android,
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.680]   Jelly Bean--
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.160]   Does not--
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.320]   --so it solves the patent problem.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.000]   So we'll see.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.120]   But again, Jelly Bean is a pretty highly differentiated
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:11.640]   product.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.840]   Like, I look at the Nexus 7 that I have, which I really like.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.560]   I think it's a terrific little product.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.880]   And it's really different than the iPhone.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.760]   Everything about it is different than the iPhone.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.280]   You don't use it and say, this is a copy of an Apple product.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.480]   You say, this is a really unique and different product.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.880]   And that's the goal.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.520]   Ultimately, that's the goal.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.520]   You can complain about the patent system
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.280]   and intellectual property and all this stuff.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.640]   And yes, our system has very meaningful flaws
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.120]   and is broken in some ways.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.200]   But the whole idea is that Apple made one thing
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.360]   and Samsung has to make another thing.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.200]   And having more different things is good.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.160]   And so if all this noise pushes these companies
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.160]   to make different kinds of products,
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.880]   I think we actually do benefit.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.000]   But if Google is saying that Jelly Bean
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.960]   solves all the patent problems, why would Samsung
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.440]   be forced to the bargaining table?
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.600]   I mean, couldn't they just say, OK, fine, all of our phones
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.320]   from now on are the Google experience.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.920]   They're Jelly Bean and above.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.640]   If that gets rid of all the patent complaints,
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.360]   I don't see what makes them any more willing to settle
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.680]   with Apple.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.960]   Because what you want is you want certainty.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.200]   Businesses run on certainty, not on risk.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.880]   So Samsung and Apple need to have an agreement that says,
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.400]   we agree that we will cross license our patents.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.200]   The legal technical phrase is freedom of action.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.920]   So we'll be able to have freedom of action.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.560]   Maybe Samsung has to pay Apple.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.200]   Apple can use the 3G patents.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.840]   Samsung can use the other patents.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:43.160]   And we can both make products and not worry about legal issues
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:43.800]   in the future.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.520]   And that's what you want that certainty.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.480]   So of course, this makes the barrier to entry
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.840]   for almost any other company, almost impossible.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.200]   I mean, how does this stimulate innovation?
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.280]   You'd almost think these guys are all working together just
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.440]   to say, hey, let's make this billions of dollars.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.440]   So no one else will even dare come in.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.840]   You could say it stimulates innovation
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.040]   because you better not copy somebody.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.400]   You better make up something new and innovative.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.920]   And this is why--
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.000]   This is why Google needs to sign the deal with Apple, right?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Because if they get the blanket license to Android,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   then people can go use Android to make other products.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.120]   And that's important.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.280]   I mean, that's what Microsoft does.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.480]   It doesn't look like a smartphone.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.080]   Or rectangle.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.920]   Oh, look, I have this as my new smartphone.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.920]   I really like a great way to look.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.880]   It has a slide out, a new innovation worker.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.280]   What is that?
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.920]   That's my air conditioner.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.680]   Looks like every other air conditioner remote control.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.520]   But I think there's functionality and there's design.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.600]   And when it comes to design, at what point--
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.480]   and maybe there's all kinds of trade dress lawsuits
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.320]   about a car.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.400]   It has four seats.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.400]   It has four wheels.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.520]   It has a steering wheel.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.160]   At what point does a smartphone--
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.920]   does that become just something standard
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.440]   that everybody can use and move on and the innovation maybe
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.600]   is in the OS or the software, maybe
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.680]   in the presentation layer of the GUI?
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.720]   I mean, there are people in the--
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.880]   let me specifically respond to the car thing.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.320]   And then, because I hear that a lot,
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.880]   you can make a car.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.440]   And Ford won't see you for doing four wheels and a steering
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:14.960]   wheel.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.680]   What they will sue you for is making a Mustang.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.840]   And that's really important.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.720]   That's a huge difference in cars.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.840]   And, yes, some cars, like family sedans, to my eye,
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.640]   they all look the same.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.280]   And they're not distinctive and innovative.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.840]   But the Mustang is like a classic icon
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.200]   of automobile engineering that Corvette.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   There's all kinds of Ferrari.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.360]   And you can't run around making cars that look like Ferraris.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.480]   Because Ferrari will sue you.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.800]   They'll say, that's our mark.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.960]   What about the kit cars that do exactly that,
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.000]   that look exactly like a Ferrari?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.720]   So again, underreported, right?
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.080]   It's not a billion dollar lawsuits.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.600]   It doesn't hit the front page of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.080]   Those companies could sue left and right.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.960]   They all have licenses to these designs
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.200]   because that's what you need.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.880]   You can't take somebody else's investment into--
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.360]   But again, you are really talking about a look and not
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.080]   necessarily, OK, built a Mustang.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   And by the way, I don't think Ford
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:06.760]   would sue anyone.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.920]   They're such a friendly company.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.840]   You can't take--
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.560]   So you can't design the Mustang and rip off the design.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.600]   But you could put a 500 horsepower engine in.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.120]   Sure.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.600]   I mean, look--
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.000]   So that's more the OS of the car than it is the design.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.800]   So it really comes down to design again.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.000]   Yeah, it comes down-- again, the specific thing here
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.880]   that was really important, I think, to Apple was,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.680]   we invested all of this time.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.480]   We took this huge risk to make the iPhone.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.080]   This is a story they told the judge.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.600]   They told the jury, rather.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.760]   It took us five years and millions of dollars
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.040]   to invent the iPhone.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.040]   And it's famous.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.600]   This is the-- everybody knows it.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.160]   Samsung took three months to copy it
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.760]   and didn't bear any of the risk.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.600]   So that's wrong.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:48.800]   Right?
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.720]   I mean, we should be rewarded for the risk and the money
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.040]   that we-- the risk we took and the money we spent.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.080]   Now, it's not one to one with cars.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:55.580]   Right?
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.840]   Obviously, it doesn't match a car.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.520]   It's in a smartphone.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.560]   It doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.240]   But what you can say is, yes, there
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.760]   are certain fundamental necessities of a car.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.000]   There are certain fundamental functional necessities
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.880]   of a TV or a smartphone.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.600]   And those things are written out of the law, right?
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.280]   The Samsung's argument to the jury was, you know, let's not--
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.480]   they literally said, let's not pretend you can patent
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.920]   a grid of icons.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.560]   But what the jury said was, Apple's grid of icons is distinct.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.480]   It's not determined by functionality.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   You can make different kinds of grids of icons.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.520]   And Samsung copied Apple's grid of icons.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:30.720]   And--
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.040]   They're designed.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.200]   You can-- I characterized the case the entire--
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.080]   for the entire month, the case was running.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.280]   The case that Apple's argument was always, just look at this.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.400]   And Samsung's argument was, let's look at it
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.520]   in painful, exhaustive, dynamic.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.640]   And all that did is cause the jury to wrap it up in three days
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.200]   and say, we're going home.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.920]   Thanks for nothing.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.680]   Exactly.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.920]   All right, we're talking with Neil Ipatel from The Verge.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.760]   He is an attorney, even though he may not play one on TV.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.720]   And he's a great writer about technology.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.160]   The Verge is really doing a great job of covering this.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.320]   We're very glad to have you, Robert Ballister,
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.880]   from This Week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.840]   And what is it, the Tech Stop?
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.000]   The TechStop.net.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.920]   .net?
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.800]   Are you still doing that?
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.360]   Or is it on hiatus while you work for us?
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.080]   That's the hiatus while I do Twitter.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.200]   I don't want such a good job on this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.600]   Well, it's fun.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.240]   We'll talk more about that in a little bit.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.720]   And Adam Curry from NoAgendaShow.com.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.160]   I suppose if I say that NASA was able to send a patch
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:34.920]   to the Curiosity rover in New Mexico, you wouldn't even--
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.440]   you wouldn't be impressed.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.960]   You're just trying to make me mad bad.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.880]   The chat room hated me from the show.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.320]   They already hate you.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.960]   You have smurched Neil Armstrong.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:50.280]   And we'll get the rain stick out a little later on.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.360]   One last bit of nothing.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.760]   One last bit.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.480]   I don't know if they heard that, but I did.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:02.800]   One last-- one last bit on the Apple Samsung thing.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.160]   And Rickey Gatera is writing on Google Plus.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.960]   He says, I'm sitting in a Starbucks while I'm waiting
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.560]   for my drink.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.320]   I watched a guy with his friend pick up a newspaper.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.000]   They were talking about the Samsung Apple verdict.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.440]   Guy says, wait, so what they're saying?
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.240]   Samsung is the same as Apple.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.400]   Friend says, I know, right?
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.640]   Makes me think twice about how much I paid for my MacBook.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.920]   Seriously.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.960]   Then a husband and wife, 10 minutes later.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.200]   Samsung's iPad is the same as Apple's iPad.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.360]   And I hadn't paid how much for the Apple one?
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.000]   Honey, I told you they were a rip off.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.160]   He says, this is the best ad campaign
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.560]   Samsung could possibly buy, because effectively the jury
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.080]   has said Samsung and Apple.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.560]   They're the same by the Samsung.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   Great point.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.840]   I don't believe that story is true for one second.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.760]   Well, it's Enrique.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.600]   I could be anecdotal.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.880]   I mean, I just-- I mean, I think that's wishful thinking.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.200]   Look, I think American consumers
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.920]   definitely know when they hear this is a rip off,
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.440]   they tend to not pick the rip off, right?
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.560]   I don't think they think their head, oh, what a great value.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.680]   I'll just buy the rip off.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.400]   But do they have it?
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.560]   Wow, man, I know about that.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.960]   I don't know about that either.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.000]   You look at the sales numbers, and I don't know about that.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.880]   You're holding it somewhere very high regard, my friend.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.040]   We've got people in the chat room
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.920]   who are saying that Apple is only suing because, well,
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.680]   they're using this to block competition.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.520]   But it's not working.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.440]   I mean, the suit has been ongoing.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.240]   They're trying to get injunctions against other products.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.640]   Samsung still has some of the hottest selling phones.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.040]   OK, one last question.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.200]   One last question, and then we've got to move on.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:34.960]   I know, I've been trying for a while.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.640]   Does Apple now get an injunction and stop
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.000]   sales of these phones in the US?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.160]   Well, most of them are on sale.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.720]   So they're old stuff.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.800]   They're vibrant.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.760]   Who cares?
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.520]   But the Galaxy S2 is in the case, and the Galaxy S2
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.280]   is still a huge seller.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.360]   I think it's like Boost Mobile or somebody
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.520]   just actually announced the Galaxy S2.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.000]   So yeah, within two weeks, there's
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.080]   going to be another hearing on injunctions for these phones.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.320]   And then in a few months, the Galaxy Nexus--
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.840]   Is there a precedent set?
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.000]   Could Apple then say, well, we won this one,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.240]   so you should block the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Note?
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.960]   No, I mean, they're different findings back.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.360]   So they can't, OK.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.240]   Yeah, I mean, you have to sit in front of a jury again.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:26.120]   What the judge can say is the standard for preliminary
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.080]   injunction is irreparable harm.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.160]   So Apple can say, in lightliness, the judge
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.400]   has to decide your case is likely to win,
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.120]   and there's going to be irreparable harm.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.680]   So Apple can say now, the likely to win factor here
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.880]   is really high.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.960]   And this phone is directly competitive with our phone,
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.840]   so there's definitely going to be irreparable harm.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.640]   Give us the injunction.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.280]   So it does influence that.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.320]   It does perhaps make it easier to get an injunction.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.280]   Yeah, but it's not as simple as one phone as the other phone.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:54.840]   Right.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.400]   But it does lend some weight to that argument
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.160]   if you want to go back to court and say, OK, now you've
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.800]   got to stop the Note 2 and the Galaxy S3.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.000]   Yeah, well, and we'll see if-- I mean, again, Apple and Samsung,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.960]   they need to come off there.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.560]   This weekend was probably intense.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.480]   Everyone got really drunk for different reasons this weekend.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.960]   I think they need to brush off their hangovers,
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.440]   sit down in a room, and figure out an actual agreement
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   to make sense for both companies moving forward.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.640]   Because all this extra litigation, like I'm saying,
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.760]   it's just additional risk and uncertainty,
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.720]   and it's not good for either company.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.800]   They've got to make an agreement.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.080]   They really do.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.800]   And Google, too.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.120]   Hey, this show brought to you by that really nice car
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.400]   company.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.240]   They're sweethearts.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.680]   They're really nice.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.560]   Don't make a Mustang, but they're really nice.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.840]   I think they probably wouldn't take kindly to that,
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.600]   but they are a nice company.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.760]   I know some of these guys, and I'm
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.880]   very proud for our association with the Ford Motor Company,
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.120]   that blue oval.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.520]   I'm proudly drive a Mustang.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.200]   And love it.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.160]   Now, let me tell you, if you are a Ford fan,
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:02.000]   you've got a new site just for you, social.ford.com.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.320]   This is a great place to read articles about Ford technology.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.760]   In fact, I have a little one there about an interview
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.080]   I did with Jim Bukchkowski, who's a Ford technologist,
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.120]   about some of the stuff that's coming to Ford and Ford
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.120]   sink in the future.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.640]   I thought it was very interesting stuff.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.080]   But there's also got an ideas section
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.960]   where you can post your ideas, read other people's ideas
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   for ways that you could improve the Ford automobile.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.200]   Bring back the Capri.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.920]   Yeah, baby.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.280]   The Capri MK3.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.600]   Vote on the ideas.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.760]   Let the world know what you think.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.760]   It really is kind of fun.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.360]   There's images.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.160]   I had a Capri with a leather top.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.160]   Did you?
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.760]   And the little miniature bra that hung from the rear view
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   in the rear view?
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.320]   I don't think that's original equipment, but OK.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.520]   OK.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.200]   You can add that.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.920]   There's an aftermarket thing you could do.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.600]   They also can get a badge here while you're there.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.880]   I don't know this badge thing.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.080]   The kids love the badge thing, I guess.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.120]   But you can have a Ford fan badge.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.080]   I could get the Mustang badge.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.280]   I like the classic, the retro.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.920]   And they also say, if you're a tech geek,
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.760]   there is a tech geek badge now.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.080]   You're not just ahead of the curve.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.320]   You're the one leading it.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.800]   Looks like an NFC tag, actually.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.280]   It's kind of cool.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.120]   Ford is doing this at social.ford.com.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   Take a look at the latest vehicles from Ford.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.960]   Drive one today, that 2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.760]   Just love that.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.800]   The Ford Sync, the My Ford Touch.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.840]   They're doing some really cool stuff.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.160]   Go to social.ford.com.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.160]   It really was one big story next week,
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.360]   and the week after big stories.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.240]   I'm sure that the verge is--
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.840]   you don't get to rest at all, Neil.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.600]   Because this week, the Galaxy Note 2, Samsung, and EFO
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.120]   will announce that in Berlin.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.960]   The week after, we've got announcements
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.640]   from Nokia, from Motorola.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:58.240]   Nokia probably announced the new Windows 8 phone.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.680]   The next Lumia, I guess, though.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.120]   I don't know if they'll call it that.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.760]   Maybe Windows RT tablets.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.200]   Amazon's got an announcement.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.640]   What are they going to-- that's September 6.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.520]   What are they going to announce then?
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.320]   A new Kindle Fire?
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.120]   I think they're going to announce a number of media overtaken
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.920]   by Kindle Fire puns, I think, as prior to the sun.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.520]   No, I think they're going to do a new tablet, something
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.920]   a little smaller, thinner, not smaller, but thinner.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.520]   And I've heard a lot about a phone.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.200]   So I'm--
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.440]   A phone?
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.080]   A phone?
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.320]   An Amazon phone?
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.040]   How would that work?
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.640]   Would they have a deal with a carrier,
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.520]   or would it be unlocked?
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.640]   How would that work?
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.200]   I think they definitely need to have a deal with a carrier.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.120]   And I don't know how it's--
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.200]   I don't know how Amazon adds value to a phone platform.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.160]   I'm assuming it'll be Android.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:51.120]   So I'm very curious to see what they're differentiating.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.400]   Right now, the carriers drive the phone market.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.240]   If you want to make a phone, you can't just show up.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.280]   You have to get in bed with a carrier in the United States.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.960]   So I think it's hopelessly broken.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.280]   I actually think, to Adam's earlier point,
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.680]   you can't be a startup and make a new phone.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.160]   Paddens are one problem.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.280]   The bigger problem is that you've
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.160]   got to sign a deal with the devil.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.960]   You've got to go and get AT&T to sell your phone.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.120]   And Amazon's got to do that.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.720]   So I expect them to be on every carrier.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.080]   They have the clout to do it.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.200]   I just don't know what their value proposition
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.000]   the consumer will do.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.400]   Yeah, you could see the value proposition of the Kindle Fire.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.800]   It was basically a very cheap tablet.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:28.480]   There was a portal to Amazon so people would buy Amazon stuff.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.160]   They don't need to add a phone to that
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.120]   to make it any more valuable.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.840]   No, I mean, the only feature I can think of,
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.400]   which I think is kind of funny, that you could put on an Amazon
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.240]   phone, is that the camera would automatically detect all the
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.160]   markets around you in the store.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:42.440]   Oh.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.240]   And I'll tell you how much cheaper it'd be on Amazon.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.400]   You know, you go into stores now, they say, no cameras, no
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:46.680]   cameras.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.560]   They know very well.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.760]   That's exactly what people do.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.840]   They go in and in.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:56.520]   And there is actually a Jewish Talmudic law.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.600]   I think it's Talmudic, the shopkeeper's law.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.320]   Or maybe not.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.120]   It's more of an ethical conundrum where I know I'm looking
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.240]   at you, Father Paul.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.680]   Welcome home.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:11.480]   Dr. Mom, where the thought is you don't go, it's unethical to
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.880]   go into a shop to get a shopkeeper to show you everything,
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.760]   talk with you, go back and forth, and then go out and buy it
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:19.640]   from the guy next door.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.200]   You have a certain moral obligation to buy it from the
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.640]   guy who showed it to you first.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.160]   But that's exactly what people are doing now.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.280]   They're going to a camera store.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.200]   They'll play with the camera.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:28.640]   They'll look at it.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.040]   They say, thanks.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.480]   And they go to Amazon.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.680]   American consumers, man.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.760]   The free market in America, Leo.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   What are you talking about?
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.360]   It's unethical.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.760]   It is a Talmudic injunction, says Dr.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.600]   Mom, not to raise the hopes of a shopkeeper.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.560]   Are you kidding me?
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.800]   No, I didn't make that up.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.400]   I got it.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.880]   We didn't go over that law school.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.360]   I missed that.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.000]   It's do not do not be a heartbreaker while shopping.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.920]   In this case, the jury sentences you to hell.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.600]   It's they call it the shopkeepers law.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.280]   It's amazing.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.400]   By the way, their phone, they would have a name for it.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.280]   It's going to be called the Amazon Kin.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.600]   Ooh, that's terrible.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.360]   Oh, I get it.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.280]   There was a Microsoft phone of the same name.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.360]   We need a rimshot because I'm slow.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.240]   I'm slow.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:19.560]   All right.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.760]   And then, OK, so then that's the silly season.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.800]   We're all the little guys.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.560]   Nokia, Motorola, Google, Amazon, Samsung,
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.400]   announced their stuff.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.880]   And all of that is almost like an opening act for
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.080]   September 12th when Apple, we still don't know.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.200]   But everybody seems to agree.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.600]   We'll announce the new iPhone.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.520]   Yeah, it's going to be a really busy month.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.200]   It's crazy.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.560]   It's funny that Apple, Apple's setting a date or rumors of a date.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.680]   They haven't set a date yet.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.840]   No invitations yet.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.400]   But yeah, I'm pretty confident about the 12th.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.600]   But once that's supposed to get locked down,
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.320]   it's funny to see all the other companies start to walk down
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.400]   their heads as well.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.000]   And they all fell seriously dominant.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.920]   It's like after Apple, after this date, the 12,
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.800]   kind of started circulating, invitations for the week
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.400]   before it started flooding out.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.200]   And it's funny because nobody wants to compete with Apple,
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.600]   but they're all perfectly happy to step on each other's toes.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.960]   Yeah, some of these did not split so the same day.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.640]   The fifth and the sixth got very, very popular.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.600]   I've already gotten Acer, Motorola, Samsung.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.040]   It's got-- no, some of that's because it's the beginning
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:22.880]   of a new quarter, right?
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.200]   I mean, this is when you might do it anyway for the shopping--
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.520]   you know, the holiday shopping season and all that, right?
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:29.960]   Yeah, and that's what it is.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.560]   But Motorola, I think their event is probably the Droid
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.960]   Razer HD.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.920]   And it's like, OK, yeah, you can definitely
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   probably do that on the same day as Nokia or whatever.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:42.280]   Like, I don't need a full day to process a higher resolution
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.440]   screen on a Droid Razer.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.720]   Like, here it is.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.840]   You could probably just send it to me in the mail.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.360]   We don't need to do this dance.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.880]   It's a sign of respect.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.640]   They're saying the news cycle will be dominated once Apple
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.440]   makes an announcement.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.400]   So we're not even going to bother.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.120]   After September 12.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.520]   And now here's the other thing.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.320]   And John Gruber-- and I don't know
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   whether to think John is being disingenuous
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.040]   or is just an idiot savant or what.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.240]   And I say that with respect, because Gruber publishes
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.200]   a blog post this week saying, you know, I've been thinking,
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.360]   he says.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.520]   He says, I've been thinking about this Apple announcement.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.200]   And you know, after a lot of thought, I've decided,
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.680]   Apple probably won't do a mini iPad announcement
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.760]   at the same time as they do the iPhone.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.000]   Why would they do it?
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.720]   They'll have a separate announcement at a different time.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.600]   I've been thinking.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:40.360]   He apparently came out of nowhere with his thought.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.040]   The next day in all things, D, John Pachowski says, yeah,
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.320]   that's actually what Apple's going to do.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:50.240]   Have you heard anything about that?
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.800]   Has Apple called you with that rumor?
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.000]   No, they have not.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.680]   Is an Apple place in these stories?
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.920]   I don't know.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.400]   Usually there's a huge-- it's not John Pachowski
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.600]   who does the planned stories.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   It's the big lawsuit.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.480]   The journal will do it.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.160]   So I trust John.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.440]   Both John's in this case.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.760]   I trust them, especially with their Apple sources.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.520]   Yeah, if you're--
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.280]   But Gruber didn't apply it was an Apple source.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.960]   He says, I've been thinking about it.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.320]   Well, it makes sense.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.120]   I mean, Apple doesn't have a long history of announcing
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.160]   anything along the iPhone.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:26.680]   Right.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.920]   No, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.160]   And I don't know if Pachowski is thinking
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.960]   or if he's got a tip.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.840]   And particularly with, Apple likes to be very focused.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.600]   And if they're going to do a whole new product,
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.280]   like the iPad Mini, I don't think they're going to be like,
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.520]   well, we've got the iPhone, and here's this other thing.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:45.920]   Here's one more thing.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.840]   I think they're going to say this is-- here it is.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.120]   Like, here's some big deal for the iPad Mini.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:52.760]   Daily will see.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.200]   I mean, to answer your specific question,
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.600]   I think John Gruber really was just riffing.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.160]   I mean, he's a columnist.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.960]   His site is basically his column.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.000]   So I think he really was riffing.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   They're in Fireball.net.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:05.280]   Yep.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.000]   And I think John Pachowski actually went and reported it out.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.360]   You know, that's actually very-- that's both of their styles,
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:12.880]   right?
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   Right.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:13.640]   It's exemplary.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.120]   No.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.040]   I think that's what happened there.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.040]   And they came up with the same exact conclusion.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:19.920]   Well, yeah.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.480]   So September really is going to be even crazier.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.720]   Well, I don't know if Apple will announce it.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.560]   I think they'll let the--
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.080]   Well, they'll wait.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.520]   --whatever they announce on the 12th will be the phone,
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.320]   probably.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.040]   And I think they'll wait until closer to the holidays
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:32.800]   to do the iPad.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.160]   I can't wait too much, though, because you've
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.320]   got to get it in the stores.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.520]   Yes, but it's their own-- they own the stores.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.020]   OK.
[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:39.720]   Oh, that's right.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.520]   It's their store.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.520]   Oh, we're going to be--
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.520]   they've got this figured out.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.040]   I think it was--
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.480]   There is a certain advantage to that, isn't there?
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.400]   I didn't think of that.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.800]   They don't care about Best Buy and Target.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.640]   You know, actually, I just had a friend who bought an iPad
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.800]   at Best Buy over the weekend.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.960]   And she was like, I got to go to Verizon and get this activated.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.120]   And I was like, wow, that sucks.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.120]   Wow.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.120]   You've got to--
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:04.120]   Wow.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:04.880]   You don't?
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.320]   OK.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.560]   Best Buy just lied to you when you bought this thing.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.400]   That's how bad your purchasing experience was.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.680]   Adam, what do you use for a phone?
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.280]   I use the Galaxy Note.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.280]   I think we talked about that last time.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:14.800]   Oh, you showed them.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.720]   I love the Note, yeah.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.960]   Yeah, I had big hands.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.880]   So that works for me.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.960]   I do get a lot of laughs when I hold it up to my head.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.240]   Geez, the stylus.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.760]   I'm not.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.160]   You know what?
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.120]   I use it in two instances sometimes.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.320]   I want to take a screenshot.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.320]   And if I'm sending something to someone who's developing
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.920]   something, I'll say, look at this, circle it,
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.000]   and like, this is no good.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.480]   And I do find it handy when someone says,
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.960]   take down this number.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:43.720]   Or my wife says, oh, he's the confirmation code for UPS.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.320]   You can fire it up pretty quickly.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.720]   And I just write--
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.960]   Just use the stylus.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.840]   It is easier to do that than to try to type it out,
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.600]   even on a big plate.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.280]   Much easier.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.920]   So I use that surprisingly often, actually.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.080]   I didn't buy it for that reason.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.720]   I bought it for the size.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.880]   And the speed, and of course, silly me,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.200]   they're coming out with something.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.120]   Now they have the quad core or whatever.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.920]   Yeah, the Note 2 comes out in the three days.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.160]   But is that--
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.680]   Tilla phone or is that a tablet?
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.200]   Tilla phone.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.400]   It's just a little bit bigger.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.200]   Five and a half inches.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:11.920]   See, they got me.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.640]   They've chipped me.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.920]   I hate that.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.280]   So they stolen that idea from Apple.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:21.720]   You buy something that comes with something better a week later.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.080]   I love the Note.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.920]   And I'm using the Galaxy S3 right now.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.240]   That's pretty big, right?
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.840]   Well, it's the same resolution as the Note.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.840]   It's just a little smaller screen.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.000]   But I kind of miss the Note.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.280]   I keep pulling it out and looking at it lovingly.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.560]   Mine bigger than yours.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.240]   Ah, yeah, yours is bigger than mine.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.680]   I'm using the Note 2, actually.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.720]   That's the--
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.640]   There you go.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.120]   Fidget Hink, can you get?
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.160]   How big is too big for a phone?
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.640]   I keep on it.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.120]   It fits in a--
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.440]   It fits in a pocket.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:52.960]   Yeah?
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.560]   But people don't understand that priest's vestments
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.680]   have pockets that are 0.38 inches bigger.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:58.560]   Secret pockets.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.800]   Than normal people.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.920]   I am an Apple guy.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.760]   And honestly, I really just--
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.640]   I got bored of their icon lineup and not being
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.440]   able to customize and do other things.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:13.640]   And that's when I went to Android.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.440]   I'm a Sanogen mod guy.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.600]   I like that.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:20.160]   Try and rip out as much of the tracking stuff.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.400]   I haven't done it yet on the Note.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.600]   I'm a little worried about rooting it.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.840]   All the time, all of a sudden, whoop, there goes my GPS flips
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:29.080]   on for no reason.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.920]   I don't like that.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.320]   No, that's the one issue.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.720]   And that's one of the reasons I don't mod use the mods.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.720]   I love Sanogen mod.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.920]   But that doesn't happen with the mods.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.160]   Oh, that happens on the stock.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.080]   Oh, interesting.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:40.600]   Oh.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.320]   Huh.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.000]   So you're using CM9 on the Note?
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:45.720]   Not yet.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.640]   Not yet.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.440]   I'd use it on my Nexus and liked it very much,
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.240]   except somehow when there's an update,
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.900]   then the phone would go a little crazy to not
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:57.600]   deal with updates.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:00.480]   And by the way, stop with the updates.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.920]   There've been a lot--
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.040]   This is not good.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.440]   You update-- I'm seeing this from big companies.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.720]   You update an app.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.800]   And then the next day, oh, we're fixing a few things
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.560]   that were screwed up on the update yesterday.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.720]   That's very annoying.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.800]   I cannot open it.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.480]   No, I totally agree with you.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.440]   The iPhone or the iPhone or the iPad,
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.480]   and there's 30 updates every day.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.240]   And if you don't do it, then before you know,
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   you're going to be sitting around for an hour waiting
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.680]   for everything to update.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.720]   I don't know, especially on the iPhone.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.640]   Now that they've got Wi-Fi sync,
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:33.080]   I have no idea why it doesn't just auto update every night
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.120]   when I plug it into the dock.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:34.640]   It should just--
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.400]   Well, there's a huge--
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.400]   Android auto updates.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   --for that.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:37.920]   But yeah.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.200]   Android auto updates.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   That's right.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.200]   You know, Facebook has allowed to update itself.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.840]   And I want to babysit Facebook.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:44.680]   Like, I trust them.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.200]   Right.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.120]   I should be able to--
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   OK.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.360]   I just love it when someone says I trust Facebook.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.680]   Well, he's what he's saying is I trust them to do
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   certain things.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.000]   OK.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.480]   I know.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.000]   I know.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   I know.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.520]   You know what I'm--
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.800]   Look, you know where you stand with Facebook.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.320]   Right?
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.000]   Right.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Sure.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.600]   Facebook isn't going to put a virus on my phone.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.120]   There's one thing.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:06.400]   No.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.600]   But they will, however, take all of my--
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.400]   It is a virus.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.000]   It is a virus.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   I don't have to.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:10.800]   You're talking about it.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.600]   I don't have to.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.880]   That's exactly right.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.600]   We are the virus.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:16.680]   Wow.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.760]   This is one of the rare cases where I am absolutely with Adam.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.240]   I have a brand new jelly bean nexus here.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.640]   But I stay on my S2 because I have a stable mod that's rooted.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.200]   And I've ripped out all the tracking stuff.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.240]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.560]   I'm paranoid like that.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:31.920]   I just--
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.200]   It's the NFC that's going to be weird.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.240]   That's the stuff that I'm very interested in seeing
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.400]   how that plays out.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.960]   In what respect are you worried that people
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.160]   with communications, you get an RFID chip can execute things
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.600]   on an API in your phone, correct?
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.120]   Right.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.840]   But that's RFID, which has a much greater range than NFC.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.720]   I'm sorry?
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.280]   RFID has a greater range than NFC.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.400]   NFC is a passive channel.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.680]   NFC is almost a bit--
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.480]   But doesn't NFC work off of an RFID chip?
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.560]   So if I shot confetti into the air
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.800]   and had little RFID chips on it and it had some instruction,
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.480]   I could make Times Square all go to my website.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.400]   I'm using it.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.000]   You know, that case it would work,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.600]   but you need almost physical contact with the two antennas
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.640]   in order to make NFC work.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.920]   Yeah, that confetti never gets anywhere, it doesn't.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.080]   I know.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.200]   You are right that NFC is the same--
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.520]   it's a subset of RFID.
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.280]   But the particular subset it is is it limits
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.680]   the range of communication to four inches.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.280]   So that's the way--
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.960]   It's kind of almost exactly what NFC is about is,
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.840]   yeah, we'll do our RFID, but you've got to be close.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.840]   And at four-- I've never got to work with four inches.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.720]   I almost always have to tap it.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.880]   That's why the NFC antenna--
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.280]   By four inches have never been a problem.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.840]   This is the NFC antenna.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.720]   It's so big because it's so low power.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.440]   So you have to get right up next to it in order to activate it.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.920]   We have the warranties voi did you know?
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.800]   No, no, no.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   The Nexus 7 is designed to take off the batch.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.200]   I love that.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.240]   You can actually buy back.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.520]   I love the change the color.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.240]   I love that.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:07.840]   That to me--
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.200]   That's the $199 top of the top.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.720]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.480]   Yeah, the Nexus 7-- everybody should buy an X7.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.640]   Like, to me-- you know what it is?
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.320]   The interesting thing to me about the Nexus 7
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:25.640]   is that it's finally the real answer to the iPod touch.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.200]   Because an Android has never had a device like the iPod touch,
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.000]   where it's like, I don't want to get a phone.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.920]   I don't want to contract.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.000]   I don't want to do all this crap.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.080]   I just want to play with the apps, right?
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.440]   The Nexus 7 is that device for Android in every reasonable way.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.000]   It doesn't run tablet apps or all the great tablet apps.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.800]   It runs all these great phone apps for Android.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.200]   It's $200 you can just buy it.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.320]   You can consume a bunch of media.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.240]   You can screw around with it.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.800]   It's virtually disposable.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:47.920]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.840]   I mean, it's a great product.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.280]   And it really shows like, that's why
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.920]   Samsung should stop making touch with it, right?
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.120]   Because the stock Google experience now is so good
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.920]   that they could just give it to people.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.000]   And it's different and meaningfully better than some stuff
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:04.600]   on iOS.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:08.480]   In fact, I would say touch whiz and sense and blur
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.480]   and all of these other kind of carrier and phone
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.000]   add-ons are really a negative.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.600]   People want the-- I think they want
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.800]   the playing Google experience now.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.480]   Yeah, you know, I know who is telling me this.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.960]   But it's like, some insane number of people
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.520]   when they buy a Windows laptop, they just reinstall Windows.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.320]   Like 30% of Windows customers.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.720]   But you can't do that on a phone, right?
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.560]   You've got to root it and mod it into all this stuff.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.760]   I think we're going to see a big push towards stock,
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.760]   Android, in a lot of places.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.920]   I think Samsung finally has the clout to do it, too.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.520]   They've started doing that with the S3, which is it used to be,
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.560]   they were just trying to get their phones into the window.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.560]   And so they would do whatever the carriers ask them to.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.320]   Now they're such a big manufacturer.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:49.680]   Let me--
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.160]   And they've got such popular products.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.200]   Let me just ask a question.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.480]   They can say, look, this is the product.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.200]   Take it or leave it.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.240]   Who makes this-- let me just ask the audience in our studio
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:57.440]   answer.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.440]   I've got 40 people here.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.360]   Who makes this seven tablet?
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.200]   Anybody know?
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.840]   Who?
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.280]   I wonder if anybody-- I wonder if anybody knows.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.400]   Because what I'm thinking after this trial,
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.920]   it looks like a Samsung and Apple world, doesn't it?
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.640]   The chat room knows.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.840]   It's Asus.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.320]   But I think the general world probably
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.160]   thinks this is a galaxy tablet.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.880]   There were a few people back here that way.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.880]   Everything I knew.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.380]   I knew.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.200]   It was the first person who said it and everyone else just
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:23.560]   repeated it.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.960]   Yeah, what he said.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.800]   I heard a Samsung here somewhere.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.960]   But I do think that people feel like it's Samsung,
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.560]   and that it's really a Samsung Apple world now, isn't it?
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.160]   Well, I mean, for phones, it's absolutely a Samsung
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.440]   Apple world.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.920]   What happened to HTC and the online?
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.320]   Why did they make good stuff?
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.160]   The one is a great phone.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:41.680]   No, they do.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.520]   They make terrific stuff.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.760]   I think if I had to buy an Android phone and a carrier,
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.160]   I would probably--
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.240]   aside from the galaxy and access,
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.720]   I'd probably get a one-series phone.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.960]   I don't know, man.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.680]   I think they played a little too fast and loose
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.960]   with their carrier relationships.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.960]   I think they don't manufacture the stuff.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.120]   They can't bring the prices down.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.880]   They can't make the profit margins go up.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.400]   And the stuff they were doing with Sense,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.360]   the last version of Sense particularly,
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.720]   was really over the top, heavy-handed.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.880]   And I think Samsung's best-selling phone in America
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.040]   is not the S2 or the S3 or whatever.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.760]   It's the Galaxy Proveil, which is like a prepaid phone.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.720]   Really?
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.760]   Yeah, really.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.720]   That came out during the trial.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.680]   And yeah, HTC doesn't compete in that huge piece
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.440]   of the market that we never think about.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.960]   They tend to compete at the top end.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.800]   So I think HTC is going to turn it back around.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800]   Their phones are really good.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.880]   I think they understand their structural problems.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.800]   But yeah, Samsung dominates because they're
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.200]   able to produce so much stuff.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.240]   Just Samsung dominates into volume.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.920]   They're like, here's 1,000 phones.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.640]   One of the funniest parts of this whole case,
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.680]   when the jury was reading the verdict,
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.200]   they had to read the names of all of these phones
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.960]   like Fringe and French pens.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.120]   And just-- I kind of wondered, like,
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.240]   if you're Samsung, you're not room,
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.040]   and you're listening to somebody say,
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.680]   mesmerize, vibrant, fascinating, gem.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.280]   Galaxy S, 4G, Epic, 5 Touch.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.520]   It's like, are you finally embarrassed?
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.920]   Is it finally stupid?
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.480]   I hope so.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.200]   It's better than numbers.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.840]   It's better than 1, 3, 7, 4X.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.000]   Yeah, but it's just-- I mean, it was funny.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.480]   We were on our podcast when we were at the Vergecast.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.960]   We were talking-- Josh made a joke about the impact
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.000]   of the Samsung vibe.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.880]   And what he meant was the impact on the market of Samsung's--
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.000]   like, they're aesthetic.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.640]   And then we discovered that Samsung actually
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.720]   makes phones called the impact in the vibe.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.400]   So people were getting confused.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.400]   And it's like, you've got to calm down somewhere.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.040]   But that's why they're winning over HTC,
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.640]   because they flood the market with these devices.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.200]   We're going to take a break.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.520]   We'll talk some more.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.720]   I don't want to say, as the word Samsung, again,
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.160]   through the rest of this show, might say Apple.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.440]   Yeah, but no more Samsung.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.720]   And I do want to know-- we maybe do a little bit more
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.280]   phone, because I'm curious if Nokia or Motorola
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   has a chance in hell.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.240]   We'll talk about Google and the new copyright law
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.720]   in Germany that prevents them from doing any linking
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.800]   to newspapers and a lot more.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.920]   Lots more to come with, like Patel from the Verge, Adam Currie
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.240]   from noagendocheot.com.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.080]   If you were to pull out the rainstick right now,
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.680]   would it cause a hurricane in Tampa, Florida?
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.160]   Well, I'm glad you asked this Leo.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.320]   I picked up-- I was given a rainstick on our most recent No
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.920]   Agenda Hot Pockets tour, which we do every summer.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.080]   It was given to me in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.320]   I had it in the back of the trailer.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.880]   I took it through three states.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.840]   And these were severe drought states.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.200]   Every single state we went through,
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.680]   it rained between nine and 12 hours later.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:51.960]   Wow.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.840]   It came to Austin, shook that stick.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.160]   Wow.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.680]   We had a rainstorm right over the house.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.400]   And it is not beyond the realm of possibility
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.960]   that this tropical storm possible hurricane
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.200]   has been caused by the rainstick.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.720]   What kind of rainstick is it?
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.760]   Is there a brand name?
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.680]   Is it a honer rainstick?
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.560]   This is a handmade rainstick.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.400]   It was made by one of our producers.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.600]   That's beautiful.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.200]   It is a beautiful piece of work.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.160]   And I'm so happy that I can try this on your show.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:20.480]   Go ahead.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.120]   Because we did this a week ago on the--
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.720]   If it rains in Petaluma--
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.880]   Because we believe her?
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.240]   I'll be a total in the next--
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.280]   Because we're in the dry season right now.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.160]   It shouldn't be raining for another month, at least.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.480]   It has to be about nine to 12 hours.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.040]   OK.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.720]   Now, Leo, you know what the world's largest producer of rainsticks
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.220]   is?
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.220]   Oh, Samsung.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:39.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.720]   That's not that name.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.520]   [BUZZING]
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.520]   All right, here we go, Leo.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.440]   What does it sound like?
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   Let's hear it.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   [BUZZING]
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.920]   [BUZZING]
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.920]   That's beautiful.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.920]   Does it sound pretty?
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.400]   That's beautiful.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:53.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.400]   I'll give you another shake, Leo.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.880]   Is that one more--
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.800]   Is that an inch per shake?
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.880]   And one more for Petaluma.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:02.000]   Well, it's a turn.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.240]   There you go.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.560]   And let me know if it rained nine hours later where you are.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.600]   I do believe that somehow through these nets,
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.560]   we can get something done.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.480]   That would be amazing.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.160]   If everybody in the Twitter audience,
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.040]   if you just let us know if it rains in the next nine hours,
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.840]   then we'll know there is some truth to the rainstick.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:19.760]   New Twitter.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.600]   You can try and Google rainstick.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.200]   You can barely find a history on the rainstick.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.040]   It's all, oh, it's a great musical instrument.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.800]   It sucks as a musical instrument.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.000]   You can't get any different tones out of it.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.920]   Make a rainstick out of toilet paper.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.640]   Very hard to find any real history.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.200]   Well, according to Wikipedia, it was believed to be invented
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.480]   in Chile or Peru and was played in the belief
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.640]   it could bring about rainstorms.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.040]   But that's about all you can find.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.600]   Right.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.000]   And from the book of knowledge.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.520]   But the book of knowledge.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.080]   There is an article in the Peruvian Journal
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.440]   which describes the cactus used.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.320]   Yeah, where they turn the thorns inside.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.440]   Inside out.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.160]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.680]   So you use every bit of the cactus.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.280]   There's no cactus goes to waste.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.760]   No waste to cactus thorns.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.600]   This show brought to you by our friends at--
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.360]   hey, this is perfect.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.200]   Go to assist.com.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.800]   If you're in IT, I know Father Robert Ballaser.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.240]   It's been praying over a few computers lately.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.720]   You might want to try go to assist from Citrix.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.640]   It lets you take control of your IT world from a cloud-based
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.080]   platform.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.000]   We've talked about it before because, of course,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.320]   go to assist is the number one remote access solution out
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.640]   there with a big, big chunk of market share.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.000]   But now the folks at Citrix have added a feature
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.520]   to go to assist that I think makes it even better.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.800]   It's remote.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.520]   In addition to remote access, it's remote monitoring.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.920]   So here's how it works.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.160]   If you visit go to assist.com, you can actually--
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:50.360]   you can get all this kind of explained to you.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.640]   You put the crawler from the go to assist remote monitoring
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.880]   on your network.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.280]   It will not only identify all the hardware, including
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.640]   every network attached device and computer.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.240]   It will also identify all the software.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:09.160]   So now you have this great setup where you've got all the
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.640]   stuff that's on the client network monitored for you.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.440]   Next thing you do is you can set up a dashboard.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:22.800]   And you can use custom or built-in little plug-ins for the
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.560]   dashboard that do things like analyze server and network
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.320]   performance, display stats, track key metrics like CPU,
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.160]   load averages, disc utilization.
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:34.520]   So you know what's going on.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.120]   And then you've got these proactive alerts by email, by
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.600]   SMS, on your mobile phone, by instant messenger.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.000]   It'll let you know if things like, hey, the server
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.800]   performance is down.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.480]   The Wi-Fi is not working.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.320]   Even things like the toner cartridge is running out.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Or disk space is false below 5%.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.160]   And you can get in there and fix it, either with a remote
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.200]   support or if it's something like a hard driving go in there
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.240]   and put a new hard drive in.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:02.440]   And you're now a support hero because you knew ahead of
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.160]   time what was going to go wrong with the network.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.360]   And you fixed it before it became a big problem.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.320]   It is a tool that anybody who's in support should have in
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:09.880]   their tool belt.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.320]   And if you are in the managed service business, this is a
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.040]   must have.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.120]   By the way, let's just support via iPad, as well as by
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.680]   computer Mac or PC.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.240]   Any kind of hardware, this is a great solution.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.440]   Try it free for 30 days.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.320]   Visit go to assist.com, g-o-t-o-assist.com.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.520]   You can for 30 days free.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.080]   Try both the monitoring and the remote access.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.560]   You just have to use the promo code TWIT.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.400]   TWIT.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.080]   Click that promo code link on the tryout free page and use
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.480]   our offer code so we get credit.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.000]   And you are set to go.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.920]   And I think you will find this is absolutely the best.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.400]   Our own IT guy, Russell, is actually about to convert
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.480]   over to it because it pays a lot more money for the stuff he
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.840]   uses and it's not nearly as good.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.760]   Go to assist.com.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.760]   Offer code is TWIT.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.200]   So another big story this weekend.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.720]   I don't know if it's too inside baseball or not, but we
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.800]   can talk about it a little bit is Twitter and the developer
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.640]   space and what's happening at Twitter, Twitter seems to
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.880]   have decided that it doesn't, it's basically saying,
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.720]   hey, thanks for all the help developers.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.680]   Thanks for all the help third party clients.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.960]   We'll take it from here.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:21.000]   And this is just proving the same thing that we talked
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.200]   about last time was on the show with Facebook, Leo, that the
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.360]   display ad business does not work.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.240]   And they're doing everything now desperately trying to give
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.480]   value to their newsfeed.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.800]   And a lot of that is the layout.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.720]   And this, I think they've still taken the wrong track.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.840]   They should have completely become infrastructure, licensed
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.480]   their API that would have made a lot more money, longer term,
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.760]   you know, long infrastructure player.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.560]   And I think that this is a death warrant for them.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.680]   I wish they had done that.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.440]   And you were absolutely right about Facebook.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.560]   I mean, look at the Facebook stop.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.160]   You were on close that I come to my five month, $17 prediction.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.880]   You nailed it.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.480]   Almost.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.920]   But it's not five months yet.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.640]   So we still have time.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.440]   Right.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.040]   But do you call them on the school at night and just laugh?
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.760]   Hey, it's goable.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:20.360]   But people don't understand-- and I've been in the internet
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.320]   advertising because it's for a long, long time.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.000]   And I started my first company, 93.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.440]   People don't understand when it comes to advertising, there's
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.480]   a scarcity of inventory that really drives the pricing.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.640]   It's extremely important.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.640]   And maybe I can just break it down very quickly.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.160]   Which is because I don't understand what you're talking
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:35.660]   about.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:36.680]   Tell me what you mean.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.280]   OK.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.680]   So when it comes to display ads, basically a banner or a link,
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.760]   there is unlimited inventory.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.260]   Right.
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:48.600]   Facebook-- in fact, the more people on Facebook
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.080]   or the more people are on Twitter,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.360]   the more inventory there is.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.160]   Supply and demand-- I don't make these things up,
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.040]   but markets kind of work that way.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.040]   If there's a lot more supply, then there's demand.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.160]   Or unlimited supply, the price automatically goes down.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.600]   It's different when you have a television show.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.560]   Or even actually, a Twitter is a great example.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.320]   We have limited ad inventory.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.720]   We can only run four ads in a show.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.880]   Exactly.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.280]   And so let's just do the numbers real quickly.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.440]   You have an audience that is defined, not just people.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.280]   And maybe we have some social graph.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.760]   We might know a little bit about what companies they like
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.920]   if they're complete idiots.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.960]   And they click on the Coca-Cola like button, whatever.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.320]   But we know what your audience is.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.520]   That's the dumb thing to do to like Coca-Cola on Facebook.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:33.480]   I'm telling you.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.400]   This is why you have companies like Ford,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.520]   who know that there's a technology audience that
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.960]   is interested in this stuff.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:43.560]   You have to go to my assist for the IT professional.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.400]   Yeah, it's targeted.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.720]   They know what they're getting.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.920]   Let's just say, there's only-- do you say six slots?
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.760]   Is that what you have?
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.560]   Not even that.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.000]   Four.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:52.920]   Four.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.560]   So let's just-- picking numbers, I have no idea.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.000]   I'm just going to say 500,000 people.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.520]   You have a CPM cost per thousand.
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.360]   I'll just pick a number.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.640]   $40, $40 for each thousand people that watch or listen to the show.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.240]   Now you're talking some serious money.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.800]   Now you just made 20 grand for one spot.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.760]   I don't know if this is true.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.600]   No, that's about right.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.160]   That's exactly right.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.080]   You have very different numbers.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.600]   That's very close.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.640]   But these are television numbers.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.880]   Get much higher than that.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.160]   There can only be one company that
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.880]   has the beverage on the desk of American Idol.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.800]   It's limited inventory.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.240]   So when it comes to display ads, it has no value.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.600]   Because there's no scarcity in this.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.120]   And this is exactly the same thing
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.280]   that Twitter is running into.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.720]   Display advertising is not a business.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.920]   It's a remnant inventory.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.720]   It's throwaway.
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:42.680]   It's trash.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.760]   Well, and it's even worse for Twitter and Facebook
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.120]   because more and more people are using those sites on mobile
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.400]   where they're not even seeing display ads.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.440]   Precisely.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.960]   So they have trash ads on the website,
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.040]   and they got nothing on the mobile.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:57.920]   Exactly.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.680]   And if you really look at the intrinsic value--
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.880]   I know we're talking about Twitter-- but the intrinsic value
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.760]   of Facebook, which know a lot about because of their S1
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.400]   filing in their most recent quarter,
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.000]   they're probably really only worth $7 a share.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.960]   So that's why it was very easy for me to say, oh,
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.840]   this is $17 in five months.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.520]   We probably have five or six weeks left.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.560]   And it probably can still go that low.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.040]   But in Twitter, they're desperately trying to control
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.600]   everything, control their messaging, control the display,
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.120]   if you will.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.120]   This is what this is about.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.480]   If you look at the API requirements,
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.480]   it's all about display what you can and cannot display
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.840]   in a view of a tweet or a list of tweets.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.320]   Exactly.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.440]   They're trying to control it.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.200]   And they're trying to control it for advertising messaging.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.080]   And even if everyone is delighted with ads popping up
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.280]   in their tweet feed, it's not an end to me.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.360]   It does not pay off at the end.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.920]   The more people join, the more useless remnant
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.480]   inventory they've created.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.960]   Well, Nailah, you're in this--
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.240]   you're not, particularly, but the Verge is in the business
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.520]   of display ads.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.240]   How do you make those work for you?
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.320]   Well, we're sold out.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.240]   So we're doing well.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.920]   Because unlike Facebook or YouTube,
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.840]   it is quality real estate when you go to the Verge,
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.880]   you know the audience, and you know the content.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:25.640]   You're not going to get a groin shot video.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.040]   Well, how can you be sold out?
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.000]   I don't understand how your inventory can be sold out.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.960]   Well, because you say we have these mini ad units,
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.800]   you know, we do the same thing.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.440]   On a page where you don't have a limited number
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.960]   of page views, that's in fact you want more.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.440]   You want a bigger audience all the time.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.320]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know the mechanics are.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.000]   I just know that the salespeople tell me we're sold out.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:50.680]   Which is good news.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.560]   I'm looking at that.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.680]   That's what salespeople do.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.320]   You want to create fake scarcity of inventory.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.720]   This is exactly what those guys with brown shoes do.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.680]   Both graphs.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.320]   But there's, I mean literally this wall behind me in the office
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.200]   is literally the wall that separates us from the sales team.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.880]   Yeah, you shouldn't go over there.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.120]   I don't go over there.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.280]   You shouldn't.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:15.440]   But you know, the thing for us is we don't run Facebook.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.480]   We don't run Twitter, right?
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.520]   Our model is an old model, right?
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.560]   We run a publication.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.160]   We make high quality content.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.680]   When we left to start the Verge, I
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.960]   was complained about the ads AOL was putting on Engadget.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.080]   At one point, I think AOL even threatened to fire me
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.920]   because I was complaining so loudly that our ads were crap.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.320]   And so when we left to start the Verge,
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.440]   we said we want to have a great publication,
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.040]   has great content, and it also has
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.160]   to have great ads in it.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.040]   Because that's part of the user experience of our product.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.480]   So we've been very--
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.120]   our sales team is very motivated to--
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:48.560]   I think it's smart.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.240]   Our sales team is motivated to get good ads.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.360]   I don't know anything about that type of--
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   But I have to say--
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.600]   I just know that it pays my bills.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.440]   I'm looking at the front page of the Verge,
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:01.320]   and you have literally two, not one, just two, no more ads.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.280]   You have one at the top and one here,
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.240]   and that's it on a very large page.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.680]   And so in a way that they are constraining the inventory,
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.680]   Adam, and I think that's a smart move.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.320]   Well, they're not Leo.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.600]   They're constraining the amount of ads on a page.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.560]   The inventory is the number of page views.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.160]   And that is not constrained by definition.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.000]   Well, I understand.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.400]   And you're taking a model that was based on print
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.840]   where there literally was a constraint.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.360]   You have this many pages in the magazine,
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.880]   and you're applying it to the web where there is no constraint.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.800]   So the model doesn't work.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.320]   I understand.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.560]   I agree with you.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.240]   I can talk about it, but I will tell you that this conversation
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.520]   for me is way out of my depth.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.200]   I understand.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.040]   I mean, that's OK.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.840]   You're a lawyer, and we were way out of our depth on the term.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.880]   No, but it's rightly so, because editorial and advertising
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.840]   should not mix, and I agree with that.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.600]   But it's very germane to the conversation about what
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.160]   do you do if you're Twitter to monetize?
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:54.680]   Or--
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.480]   Yeah, Adam's point about Twitter--
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.880]   we actually just ran last week, ran a piece called
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.880]   Introducing Twitter's New Business Twitter by our guide,
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:03.480]   Peter Brown.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:03.960]   I love it.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.160]   I would just cry.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.320]   You know, Adam's point about they
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.440]   should be the infrastructure.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.200]   They should be the--
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.800]   they should license the API.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:11.360]   That's great.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.600]   But you know, you can look at sort of the Android model
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.680]   and say, well, this is the problem with Android.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.000]   Android said we made the infrastructure.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:18.840]   Here we go.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:21.600]   And they're improving the infrastructure as fast as it can.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.440]   Android updates are great.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.000]   And then the API partners, the phone manufacturers,
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.120]   aren't taking them.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.560]   So for Twitter's say, we're the infrastructure,
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.760]   means you're giving up a high rate of innovation.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.480]   You're saying, now we're the utility.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.680]   Once you say something is utility,
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.760]   there's no more innovation.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:39.440]   No, I disagree.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.000]   I think the innovation was in the developers who
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.440]   were using their API and creating amazing things.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.480]   And once you've got these guys in,
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.800]   you can do all kinds of deals with them
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:55.480]   for their access to the API, to the friend finder, all of this
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.320]   stuff.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.080]   But they're not exactly-- but they're not
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.760]   saying to those developers, you can't do it.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.080]   They say, if you want to do it, you've got to come talk to us.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:03.640]   And that's--
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   I disagree.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.640]   They're saying, here are very specific guidelines
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.320]   about what you can and cannot display
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.400]   and the way a tweet has to be displayed,
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.640]   completely stifling any innovation like TweetDeck.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:21.040]   TweetDeck, that was something completely new, completely
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:21.560]   different.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.440]   You couldn't have that type of innovation now
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.800]   with these developer guidelines that have been
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.600]   sent to the new law.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.800]   And above and beyond that, they're
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.920]   saying you can have this many accesses to the API
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.240]   without coming to us and making some kind of deal.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.640]   So basically, you're just a slave to Twitter,
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.560]   and you're not going to win anything.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.480]   I'm with Adam on this.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.640]   I mean, they're really constraining what developers can do.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.560]   You look at something like Clushbag, which we've shown.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.360]   It's a funny--
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:52.880]   Clushbag.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.960]   That's the one that looks through all your tweets,
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.800]   and it finds out how Clushy you've been.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.640]   Have you abused the English language?
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.840]   Have you abused retweets?
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.960]   It's a tetra tetra tetra.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.720]   It's everyone gets a Clush-- it's cloud.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.680]   I've got to try this.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.160]   It's pretty fun of cloud.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.280]   I wonder how I'm going to do.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.800]   But something like that, even though it
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.760]   that's supposed to be a joke, that won't
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.640]   exist under the new infrastructure that Twitter is--
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.880]   I'm a bit of a prang.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.240]   You're a bit of a prang, right?
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.400]   According to Clushbag.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.560]   Can you see this, Chad?
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:20.120]   Yeah, I'm 39 on the Clushbag.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.880]   I think I'm 12, because I deleted all my retweets.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.840]   I used to be like 16.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.320]   Yeah, that's where I score high.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.920]   Retweet abuse.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:32.240]   But I mean, that odd stuff was what made Twitter interesting.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:35.040]   It wasn't all the tweets about, yo, I'm
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.560]   about to eat a burrito, or hey, I'm in the bathroom.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.600]   It was what people could actually do with the information
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.800]   that people were putting out and open on the internet.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.000]   Well, if you get rid of that, developers
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.240]   aren't going to have that fun little hook anymore.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.040]   So I agree on a lot of that stuff.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.240]   But let me give you the counter example
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:57.160]   that to me is the danger, which is email, right?
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.440]   Email is an open standard.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.320]   Everybody can use it.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.320]   You can do whatever you want.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.160]   There's supposed to be all this innovation in email clients.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.160]   Yes, there's not.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.080]   But there's not.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.320]   And the core email standards have not
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.760]   evolved either because there's nobody driving them who
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   can extract value from the effort they put into updating them.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:15.120]   But why does there always have to be that kind of value?
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.960]   I think email's been around for a long time.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.040]   And there's been a heck of a lot of innovation
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:24.480]   from the days of Elm and Pine up to the Gmail interface.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:24.960]   That's a good interface.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.520]   But then it's not.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.120]   And there's been a lot of innovation.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.840]   But at a certain point, it's what it is.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.160]   But that innovation-- the innovation
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.320]   is not in how email works.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.040]   It's in an email client and where the client lives.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.880]   But that's not the kind of innovation.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.840]   There's no infrastructure innovation.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.880]   The spam problem for email has all been solved by Google
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.840]   and the cloud, not at any level by the actual utility of email.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.440]   Twitter faces a similar problem.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.080]   And on top of the channel, feed themselves.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.120]   So they need to take control of the utility they provide
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.360]   and say, this is how we're going to get value out of it.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.160]   Because otherwise, you have to pick something--
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:04.660]   Right.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.760]   But that's a backend process.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.520]   So that would be perfect for them to say,
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.040]   we'll reduce the spam.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.880]   Within tons of Twitter spam, they could also say,
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.640]   we'll reduce the fake accounts.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.040]   And there's tons of those.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.800]   There's all kinds of things that they could do.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.320]   And I think that there's probably 20 years of innovation
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.280]   in that type of backend infrastructure.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.320]   Wow.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.200]   All right, but I'm--
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.360]   Here's-- I just got to point out.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.400]   Adam Curry is, according to Klushbegg,
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.760]   quite a nice person with a mere 17 points on the Klushbegg
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:31.280]   scale.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.360]   But John Cena, Horak--
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.920]   All right, you can pull out some weaponry.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.280]   John Cena, Horak.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.280]   Not a nice person.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.280]   Here's the answer we have today for you.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.280]   Oh!
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.240]   First the judge.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.880]   You still up in the game of Thrones?
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.200]   What the hell?
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:47.000]   I'm going to start this with my knighting sword.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.560]   You know, Adam, the last time he was on,
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.320]   pulled out a handgun that fires shotgun shells.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:52.680]   I have a--
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.560]   I bought a different one.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.960]   But since everyone is bringing guns on the show,
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:58.120]   I felt kind of clucy about doing that.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.200]   But you have a fun one to show you if you're interested.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:00.700]   I do.
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:02.960]   Hold on a sec, because we got to take a break.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.480]   And by the way, Niele does have a weapon.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.280]   He's got some sriracha sauce just ready.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.200]   Any time.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.560]   No, no, no, squirt me.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.680]   That stuff's worse than Mace.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.560]   I got to tell you, squirt that somebody's eyes here
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.440]   in deep trouble.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.600]   Hey, let's see what you missed.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.520]   If you missed any of Twit this week, we had some fun.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.360]   Take it away.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.440]   He's Twit.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.000]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.840]   If you're flying, I'm buying.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   It worked.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.840]   Be a nice fuck problem.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.880]   I'm going to lay it away at everybody.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.480]   Point number one, talk about how you never take a vacation.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.760]   Point number two, talk about O-O-O-O.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.400]   Dancer Mario, that's damn math.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.960]   It's the executed.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.720]   Sorry.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:39.920]   He punched me.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.880]   The Social Hour.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.520]   For a rat or five this week, wanted
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.600]   to talk about the bike charge dynamo.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.280]   Now, what this is, it's a little contraption,
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.600]   and it goes on to your bike wheel.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.960]   The idea being that you can charge your smartphone,
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.960]   your iPhone, for example, basically by biking.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.440]   Live specials.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.440]   You're staying on the mat.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.080]   Oh, with the head turned.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.120]   And I'm not sure that Lisa gets the point,
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.960]   because I'm staying inside the ring.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:10.760]   Although that's an impressive tackle.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.880]   Know how.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.480]   I want to watch Twit on my work computer,
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.400]   but I don't have admin access.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.680]   So how do I actually do that?
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.120]   How do I take Chrome or something like that,
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.880]   and bring it over to my computer,
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.480]   and be able to use it and watch Twit?
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:28.320]   If you missed this week on Twit, you missed a lot.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.040]   Those sumo suits, everybody should have--
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.120]   I want to buy those.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.120]   You got to rent them.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.760]   You sweat really bad when you be here in the don't you?
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.320]   We went through a couple of cans of Febreze
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.200]   before the day was happening.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:38.880]   It was a lot of them.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.080]   Not too sanitary.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:41.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.200]   I stepped on you, Leo, but you were saying that Devorak
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.440]   has a bigger Clush bag score than me?
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.400]   You're quite a nice guy according to Clush bag.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.360]   You're 17 points.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.720]   Devorak is 49 points.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.080]   He's super noisy.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.040]   So surprise.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.960]   By the way, Clush bag is one of the sites
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.200]   that's going to go away because of the new Twitter API.
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.840]   They cannot do it anymore.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.680]   Unless they come and talk to Twitter.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.360]   Yeah, they have to talk to us.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.040]   We want-- I mean, I presume that's money that they want.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.480]   Come back with more Adam Curry from noagendashow.com.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.440]   Niele Patel from theverge.com and Father Robert Balaser
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.560]   of this weekend Enterprise Tech, our new Enterprise
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:23.240]   show, which is Mondays at noon, Pacific 3 p.m.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.160]   Eastern Time, 1700 UTC.
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:26.840]   Great show.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.040]   You're going to-- what are you doing this week?
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.360]   You're doing something kind of different.
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.560]   This is what we let our fans vote on what they wanted to see.
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.400]   They want to see power over ethernet.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.880]   We're going to be talking about CRM.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.120]   We've actually got our guest for tomorrow's show
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.960]   somewhere here in the audience, Lou M.M., who came from the chat--
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.240]   Lou M.M. is in the studio.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:44.600]   He is.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.240]   Where's Lou?
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.120]   He's back there.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:47.360]   Yes.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.160]   Hey, Lou.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.000]   Good to see you.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.720]   So we pull people out of the chat room
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:51.960]   because that's how much we do.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.200]   Yeah, but Lou, can I say where Lou works?
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:54.480]   Yes.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.440]   He works at Microsoft.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.000]   In fact, did you bring your surface, Lou?
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.840]   Because he's been using a surface tablet.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.040]   He's not supposed to talk about it.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.320]   Whoa, he's got one.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.320]   Did you just hold up a surface?
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.320]   No.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.760]   It's a Samsung.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.760]   Oh, no.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.720]   It's a Samsung.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.320]   The new Samsung.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.640]   The Samsung Surface.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.560]   Yeah, really.
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.480]   Well, we'll talk about this.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:16.920]   There you go.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.920]   All right, Chad.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:21.040]   Sad trombone.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.680]   Before we go on, though, let's talk a little bit
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.120]   about our friends at Gazelle.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.680]   It is going to be the product season, the new product season.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.960]   And you know you're going to be wanting to get some new stuff.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:36.680]   And Gazelle is exactly what you need if you want to move on with your existing gadgets
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:40.400]   and get a little cash in your pocket so you can buy a new gadget.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.240]   So what is your iPhone worth or your Mac?
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.680]   How about my original iPad?
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.560]   Ah, I don't know.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.440]   Let's see.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.320]   You have the first generation iPad.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:55.080]   Are you thinking you might want to get that new iPad mini?
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.080]   Is it Wi-Fi?
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.080]   Yeah, it has no 3G.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.080]   This is just the Wi-Fi.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.080]   Wi-Fi only.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.240]   Let me click that button.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:04.360]   And how much memory?
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.920]   I think was the biggest at the time.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.720]   64 gigs, let's see.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.600]   175 bucks.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.360]   That thing's worth 175 bucks.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.920]   Not only that, they pay the shipping on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.480]   They will also do the data wipe.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.840]   You don't have to.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:26.880]   When they assess it for its condition, because they want to make sure they pay you fairly
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.880]   for the condition.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.640]   By the way, sometimes they do bump the price up as well as lock the price down.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640]   29 gigs.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.640]   29 gigs.
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:37.000]   That's a capacity 29 gigabyte.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.080]   Oh, you got the special 29 gigabyte.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.560]   What is that?
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.560]   I don't know.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.560]   There's something wrong there.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:47.800]   Available at 21.6 capacity 29 gigabytes.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:48.800]   I must be a 32.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.440]   But any collectors item.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:51.440]   It is.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:52.440]   They pay for the shipping.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.080]   By the way, this offer is good for 30 days.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.000]   So now this is the deal.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.480]   You should go to Gazelle.com now if you're thinking of getting rid of your old phone,
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:07.720]   your iPhone or your Samsung phone or they take HTC, BlackBerry, LG, Motorola and Nokia.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.880]   Let's say you want the new Windows phone.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.320]   This is your chance to move on.
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.080]   Get the quote now, because as soon as the new phone comes out, the value is going to
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.080]   go down.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.720]   And we know for sure value never goes up on these things.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.480]   They only get worth less and less.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.400]   But this quote is good for 30 days.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.920]   So get it now and you'll get your money.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:31.800]   You can get a cash check, PayPal or, and I recommend you do this, an Amazon gift card
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.320]   because they'll bump it up 5%.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.720]   They'll kind of rebate you their Amazon affiliate code.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.600]   So 5% more when you get an Amazon gift card.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.840]   These guys are good people.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.840]   Really great.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840]   They've sold.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.840]   Let me just see.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:43.840]   I have the number here somewhere.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:49.520]   The last few years, oh shoot, what did I do with it?
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.280]   I put it here somewhere.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:55.680]   300,000 customers, $50 million.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.080]   $50 million they've paid out.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.080]   Hello.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.600]   Yeah, hello is right.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.880]   Gazelle, just keep it in your mat back of your mind.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.960]   Get the quote now if you think you might be buying something.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.720]   It's a new obligation.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.840]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com.
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:12.200]   And you know, it's funny, Gazelle likes to buy the ads right before the new iPhones come
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.200]   out.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.840]   That's better than all things D.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:18.480]   Now you know there's definitely a new iPhone coming out.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.480]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:23.960]   You know, and Leo, I have to say that not all products are worth less as they go on.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:28.440]   In fact, I have some old Samsung phones that I think just sold for about $1.04 billion.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.640]   And they were worth a lot more.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:33.240]   A lot more to Samsung.
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.560]   Maybe this, I don't know, is Barry Diller confused Adam Curry?
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.800]   Apparently, according to Peter Kafka writing for All Things D, The New York Times is about
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.800]   to sell.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:49.600]   It's about.com unit to Barry Diller and IAC for $300 million.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:55.000]   Yeah, I've been very surprised by the IAC purchases.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   That's a word.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.160]   I mean, if display ads don't work, about.com is not worth $300 million.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.160]   You know, I was a, he's bought some weird stuff.
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:07.920]   I was a pre-IPO investor in Ask Geeves.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.920]   Oh gosh.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:11.000]   But you made some money on that.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.080]   Oh, outstanding.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.280]   I spent it all in the last 10 years, but I made some good money then.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.440]   You don't have that plane anymore, huh?
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:20.800]   But Diller bought it.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:25.800]   You know, it's like they have a really weird philosophy about what has value.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.880]   And I don't, I mean, I don't know the numbers of about.com.
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.680]   I think it probably was a good idea.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.800]   I like the idea of a directory that you can browse.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.800]   Browsing anything is going away with the internet.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.200]   You know, just, you know, browsing and the psychopedia, browsing, addictionary.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.400]   And about.com, what had a little bit of a browse concept to it?
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.080]   I don't know if it's really worth $300 million.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:50.720]   And maybe it's just his early ploy into buying the New York Times itself.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:53.000]   I mean, that could be his end game.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.880]   One of the reasons at times is interested is he's apparently offering cash.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.240]   So 300 million cash for about.com.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.240]   That's an interesting story.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.400]   Diller, is he not the guy behind Ariel?
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.400]   I think IACO.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, the mini antennas.
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.360]   Yeah, this is this to me.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.360]   He could make all that money back and then some with Ariel.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.160]   Really interesting.
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.000]   Ariel is the most hilarious hack.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000]   I think technology today.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.040]   Because you know, it's the idea that they've invented some tiny antenna.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.960]   They've got a warehouse in Brooklyn full of antennas for people.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.840]   It's just like, we've got to do better than this.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.160]   I mean, it's a great idea on the product is interesting and it works well.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:34.160]   And it delivers, you know, to the end user delivers what you want.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.120]   You go to a website, you watch TV, right?
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.120]   That's what people want.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:44.400]   But they've got to, we've got to adjust like how we regulate television in a way that like
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:47.520]   doesn't require a warehouse full of tiny antennas in Brooklyn.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.000]   Well, that's why he won that court case, right?
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.760]   Because he was being sued by the cable and the broadcast channels to say, you can't do
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.760]   that.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.240]   And the court said, well, of course he can.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.800]   He's just renting an antenna.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.560]   It's one antenna per customer.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.440]   Well, I hadn't won yet.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.440]   They asked for an injunction.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.040]   They said there's a reparable harm.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.200]   So the trial, oh, another lawyer goes and spoils the host story.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.160]   So no, this is that case is still going on.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.160]   That case will go on.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.200]   You know, that'll be kind of a landmark case.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.680]   I mean, that.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.000]   Ariel has no real future.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.800]   I mean, of course, everything's going to be streamed on the internet.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.120]   And this is Barry Diller, an old school television guy, you know, Fox and the original fun,
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.840]   not Fox is the original Fox network.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.960]   This is what he did, you know, this is what he knows and understands.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.680]   And if anything, that's probably him just going, I got you a second.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.080]   I don't think it has a new long term.
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.080]   Really?
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.080]   Because I love it.
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:40.080]   I just there's something about it.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.560]   These antennas are about as big as a dime.
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:42.560]   I've seen it.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.560]   Dr. Mom.
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:46.960]   And we can't you can only get it in New York City right now, which means Nylize you've
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.960]   seen it.
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:52.160]   But yeah, Dr. Mom brought her iPad here and she did a little hack to sell her.
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.200]   She told her iPad, I'm in New York.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.200]   And I played with it.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.040]   The picture quality is excellent.
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.680]   It has DVR built into it.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.160]   And you and what it is is kind of the last mile for court cutters because you can be
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:09.280]   a court cutter and watch everything on, you know, your internet access except for live
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.280]   TV.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:16.680]   Yeah, but it's also like, just think about how remarkably stupid that is.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680]   Well, I understand.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.960]   Like if you're a court cutter and you're like, the last thing I need is broadcast TV.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.560]   I'm going to hope that Barry Diller builds a warehouse full of antennas for me so I can
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.800]   pay him 12 bucks a month or I can go to Radio Shack and pay $12 for an antenna.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.800]   I guess.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.960]   And it's like it's just that's a problem.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:41.160]   Like that's I think that we'll see a real I think the thing that area will accomplish
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.400]   is not being a successful business.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:47.920]   I think they will ultimately fizzle out because just what they're doing is so silly.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.400]   But what they're going to push the whole market towards is a real over the top cable
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.400]   service, right?
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.600]   And this I think you're right on with that.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:00.600]   That's the real thing we need, you know, and that's where you can say to whatever company
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:05.440]   I want to watch television on my computer over the internet and you can buy channels
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.320]   all a cart, all the stuff that people have been wanting to do for years.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.840]   And we'll see television get really delivered over the internet.
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:17.640]   There's something else going on in the and kind of the crazy antenna Wi-Fi community.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:20.000]   It's very analogous to this.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   You're now buying these you had these little Wi-Fi like $25 repeaters that can actually
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.320]   take a USB storage thumb drive.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.080]   And they're setting them up.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.080]   You can hack them.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:38.880]   I think this was probably the original software hack was the or the blue boxes, the routers
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.480]   match the links is the original links.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:47.760]   And just setting up access points and just dropping them in places and you can share
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.760]   files, there's a little web server that they put on them.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:57.280]   And now with WDS, they're starting to connect to each other and creating larger nets, 100
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.240]   megabit per second Wi-Fi networks that essentially are completely decoupled from the internet
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.960]   and is kind of an over the top type of system.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.600]   There's a lot of interesting stuff going on this when it comes to RF and Wi-Fi.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:13.280]   There's actually being built outside of the internet with connections to it.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.440]   And you know, when you talk about little tiny antennas, that is kind of exciting to me.
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.400]   Some good stuff going on.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:25.040]   People may not know Adam Curry started one of the first ISPs, was Metaverse, right?
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.040]   No, no.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.040]   I started on-ramp.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:28.200]   On-ramp, that's it.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.000]   Which was not the ISP on-ramp.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.680]   And then we had Metaverse.com, which I was always allowed to use with Neil Stevens's permission
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.240]   as long as it didn't make t-shirts.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:37.240]   Really?
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.240]   And the Natter meaning to...
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.640]   He said you can use Metaverse, but don't make t-shirts.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.880]   Yeah, as long as you don't make t-shirts from merchandising.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:43.880]   Interesting.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.280]   Yeah, a very nice guy.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.280]   Very cool with that.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.640]   It was in 1993.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.640]   And no one knew.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.320]   You know, like MTV, I read this at MTV.com and they didn't know.
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.320]   Right.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.320]   Well, they knew.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.320]   And they said, "That's cool.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:58.320]   We got the A-well keyword.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.320]   There you go."
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.200]   We got music television keywords, baby.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.040]   That's all the matters.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:07.960]   So you know a little bit about these kind of nascent businesses.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:10.960]   I think that's very intriguing.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:13.520]   This, by the way, for those watching on video, I know you can if you're listening.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:20.320]   But this is the size of the A-reo antenna and they put these in racks that they put
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.320]   in them warehouse in front of them.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.320]   What a hack.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320]   It's a great...
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320]   I don't know.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320]   I celebrate it.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.320]   I just love it.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.320]   I think it's a great...
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.320]   What's funny is, yeah.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:31.040]   You know, when I was a lawyer, I was a copyright attorney, right?
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.840]   And I represented...
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:36.480]   I came out of law school and I represented kids who got sued for file sharing.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.480]   Really?
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:39.240]   Yeah, I was absolutely sold to Strowing.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.720]   You know, they did it.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:42.720]   So they got to pay.
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:46.400]   Like I had kids who had to drop out of school so they could go work in a pizza joint so
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.400]   they could pay their settlement.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.400]   Oh, that's so...
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:54.480]   But I actually have no compunction about downloading broadcast network TV shows off the internet.
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.840]   Because it's free over the years, so why should...
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:57.840]   It's free over the years.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:39:59.840]   They were literally...
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.040]   ABC is beaming Grey's Anatomy through my body.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:03.040]   Right.
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.480]   So if my wife wants to watch it, like all the stuff.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480]   Right.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480]   And now I'm going to get sued.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.480]   I'm sure like...
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.480]   Because it is illegal.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.880]   It is illegal, Mr. Lawyers.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.680]   It's absolutely illegal and it's wrong.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:13.680]   I'm sure the calls are like...
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.680]   No, no, no, no.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:15.680]   No, no, no.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:16.680]   It's illegal.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:17.680]   It's not wrong.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:18.680]   I...
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.680]   I think...
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.680]   No, they're beaming it through my body.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:24.680]   Why can't I download it if I just captured it?
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680]   But it's just...
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.560]   It's one of those things where it's like because we're so focused on the internet and
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:36.000]   streaming and this distribution, we often forget that these companies, their real business
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.760]   is running these massive broadcast operations.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.760]   Right.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:43.120]   You know, that's really valuable to a lot of people.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:48.960]   It's funny because what I really want is a DVR that does broadcast, I can watch live
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:52.400]   sports and then has a host of internet services connected to it.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.920]   And nobody builds that product and I kind of don't know why.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.200]   What do you want to say for it?
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.680]   I don't want to pay anything.
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.680]   That's why nobody's building it.
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:01.680]   There you go.
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:05.880]   But like, can you imagine what that would be like if you could get a box that runs Netflix,
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:09.720]   everything runs Netflix as like Amazon video, you know, hooks into all these other services.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.120]   And has three tuners.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:15.520]   So you can record live TV off, ABC, NBC and Fox.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.960]   You can build that box.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.920]   You know, actually understand why that's not happening.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:26.320]   You understand the model that is breaking before our very eyes, which is the real time
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:30.640]   stream of information that is being beamed through your body that contains commercials
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.640]   that you cannot necessarily...
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.640]   No, I understand that.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:36.920]   But there's some stuff there that's valuable, right?
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:41.000]   So like breaking news, when there was a shooting in New York last week, I turned on channel
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.800]   seven because I know that I'm going to get news from then faster and better than the
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.800]   other ones.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.800]   And you're willing to watch the ads in the middle of it, right?
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.800]   Sure.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.880]   And those devices have existed for a long time for the hacker and the maker community.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.880]   We've been creating those for the last 15 years.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:59.240]   But the problem is that you try to have a manufacturer create them, then you have to
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:00.240]   make licensing agreements.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.920]   You have to talk to the content providers.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.920]   And look what's happening to Dish with their hopper, which has a built-in commercial
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.920]   skipper.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.840]   They're going to get sued out of existence just like replay TV got sued out of existence.
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:13.440]   There's no reason why the current Google TV could do that.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:14.440]   replay one.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.000]   First of all, replay and Tivo both won.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000]   They're lawsuits.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.240]   I mean, that's what Tivo exists.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.880]   The problem is that they're trying to get...
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.360]   We're conflating two things.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.440]   We're conflating all the cable channels we want.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.840]   We want everybody wants breaking bats.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:30.840]   We got an AMC.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.840]   Right.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:32.840]   Now you got to make the deal.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:33.840]   I'm saying screw that.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.720]   All that content off the internet somehow.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.760]   AMC is streaming it on their website.
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.240]   I'll figure it out that way.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:43.720]   But all this broadcast stuff, this live stuff, football, which I want to watch football.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.880]   So I'm never going to be able to cut the cord completely.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:50.760]   Actually, no, because I saw the NFL is they're offering pregame now.
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:54.320]   They offered the NFL, offered a Super Bowl last year streaming.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.400]   And I think it's just a matter of time, just like Major League Baseball and the NBA that
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:58.920]   you'll be able to see football streaming.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.920]   But it's sure.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.680]   But the last piece right now for most people is sports.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:03.680]   It's sports and news.
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:04.680]   I think.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.920]   And the Academy Awards and a few live things like that.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:12.000]   The Republic and the steel show to us that this model is breaking very, very badly right
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.840]   before our very eyes.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.720]   And it's not going to work out long term.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:21.280]   And sports is extremely expensive, not just because of the licensing, because of the entire
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.520]   machine that's behind it.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.960]   And the players and the stadium and the teams, et cetera.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.400]   But it's also expensive to produce.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:32.640]   I mean, everyone really wants to pay their share, which they don't, then it would be
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:36.040]   possible to do all this with commercials without commercials.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:40.000]   There's all kinds of hybrid models, but it really is still too expensive to do.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]   And what happens?
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000]   And what happens?
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000]   So what happens?
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.360]   It's well, it's interesting.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:53.240]   I spoke to who's the guy that produces the crazy TNT show where they always have bombs
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.400]   going off a team.
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.160]   I'm sure the chaff.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.320]   And the what happened to the electric car.
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.120]   >> No, burn notice.
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:04.600]   >> Drawing a blank, the chat room will know.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:06.680]   Yeah, leverage, that's a show I'm talking about.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:07.680]   >> Leverage.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.200]   >> And so this is the same guy produced what happened to the electric car.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.160]   >> Oh, that was an amazing movie.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.160]   Morgan Spurrow.
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:19.120]   >> Yes, he also did a follow up only a couple of years ago, which kind of went nowhere.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.760]   And he's quite an expert.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:21.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.760]   >> Yeah, he says they're getting closer.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.640]   He says, if you look at the throne stuff, I don't watch that.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.640]   What is it?
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:30.640]   >> Drone of Thrones.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   >> HBO, yeah.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.640]   >> You got the sword, dude.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.960]   >> Yeah, that's for different uses.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:36.960]   >> Okay.
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:40.400]   >> He says we're getting very, this is really funny how major motion pictures still have
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.080]   $300 million budgets.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.080]   A lot of that is to promote it, obviously.
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.040]   And television is getting very close to where they can actually just say, okay, if we have
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:56.080]   X amount of people paying $199 or $399 that all the effects, et cetera, will deliver the
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.760]   entertainment experience people want.
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.640]   He even, and he was pretty accurate on the electric car.
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.720]   And if you look at those documentaries, he says we're still seven to 10 years out before
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.720]   we're really there.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.400]   And all that's to do with processing power or what we can do with video, et cetera.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.360]   At the end of the day, there's a huge union issue in this industry.
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:17.080]   And I'm not saying it's a bad issue.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.280]   I'm a member of Aftra.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:23.080]   But there is an issue with residuals, with rights.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.720]   And- >> Boy, nobody talks about that.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:26.960]   >> That's not just the actors, that's grips, that's lighting.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:27.960]   >> Nobody thinks about that.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:28.960]   >> It's about everything.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.160]   >> Yeah, we all think about the big incumbents.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:34.520]   We don't think about the workers, the people who actually make this stuff.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:35.520]   >> People who actually make it.
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.920]   Yeah, well, there's a lot of people that go into making shows.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:44.040]   And they have, for good reason because of even though they are all kind of all slaves
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:48.760]   to Hollywood, it was much worse before it was unionized.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:50.880]   And that's been in place for a long, long time.
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.560]   You're not just gonna break that up.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.040]   Certainly not with this president.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:59.120]   >> Well, maybe you'll break it up with YouTube.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.520]   Maybe all the people who, maybe they're just, that's the end of that.
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:08.280]   And the next generation's gonna be YouTube stars, non-union.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.960]   >> I think people- >> At the end of the day, what are we
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:10.960]   talking about?
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:15.200]   It's entertainment and what's the real value and how important is it in your life?
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:20.440]   And you could also play a board game, which could be fun.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:25.520]   >> I think that people still want a level of quality and there's gonna have to be incentive
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.800]   or people just won't go into those industries.
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.120]   They'll just be doing something else.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:35.280]   And of course, there's gonna be some YouTube stars, but we've all seen South Park and the
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:37.360]   Department of Internet money.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.000]   Where's the real money?
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.440]   Is it real, real money?
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.440]   >> Right.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:42.440]   >> I don't think so.
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.440]   >> No, I agree.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.640]   >> And even YouTube is, I mean, I actually have experience with this.
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.080]   YouTube is investing in their channels.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:51.200]   So Vox Media and my company, they, YouTube invested a bunch for them to start a sports
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.480]   channel for explanation.
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:56.480]   And they went and built a real studio and hired real talent and-
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:02.760]   >> You know, YouTube has Google money and I calculate, YouTube is probably, if you look
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:06.760]   at just their P&L, they're probably losing a million dollars a day.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.760]   And they can afford it.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.760]   >> I'm sure.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:11.080]   >> Yeah, I don't know- >> But it's not a money making business.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:17.040]   >> Adam, what I'm saying is that even on YouTube, there is a push for higher quality, to validate
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.040]   the model.
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:22.240]   Because if you just have kitty videos and dogs and skateboards, you're never going to be
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.840]   able to try to make money.
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:26.280]   So YouTube is, they're trying to solve it, chicken and egg problem.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.880]   >> Right, well give me one example.
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:29.880]   >> Of what now?
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:30.880]   >> Anything.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.360]   >> Anything on YouTube that's good.
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:37.080]   >> You know, I'm looking at the SB Nation channel on YouTube.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:38.720]   >> And while- >> Look at the stuff where-
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:44.960]   >> Well, you have 6.9 million views, 18,000 subscribers, but then I look at the videos,
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:48.600]   you know, 209 views, 336 views, 2000 views.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:50.440]   >> Look at Corridor Digital.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:57.640]   Corridor Digital, they make high value, high production value videos, content that's incredibly
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.680]   sticky, that has a really, really strong, loyal following.
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:01.680]   >> Sticky.
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:02.680]   >> Yeah, it's sticky.
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:03.680]   And you- >> If it's not really sticky.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:04.680]   >> You can watch their content.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:05.680]   >> Is that a sales matter?
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.120]   >> You can swear that it was actually on broadcast.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.800]   >> This is 98 million views, 1 million subscribers.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.400]   There's a big difference there.
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.680]   So, but this is something that's kind of unique to the internet, is it not?
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:20.080]   I mean, this is not traditional media or is it?
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:22.080]   Look at 1.9 million views on this.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.440]   >> There's another very inherent problem.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:27.600]   Unfortunately, it comes back to what I was talking about before, but in television, we
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.000]   have a long established history of something called Nielsen Ratings.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.520]   And Nielsen Ratings is based on a percentage.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.920]   It's an agreed-to standard, essentially.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.160]   And we have something similar to that on the internet.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.320]   I would say comm score probably comes the closest.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:51.640]   And these things really aren't representative unless you have an industry-wide agreed-to
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:53.760]   standard, all kinds of competing standards.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:58.160]   And even for a tweet, you probably use a pod track or something like that.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:01.880]   If anyone really says they know exactly how many people are watching, in any medium, they're
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:02.880]   full of crap.
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.440]   And the internet is just- it really isn't measurable.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.280]   >> Well, it's a little less full of crap.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.280]   >> And it's a little less full of crap.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.280]   >> It's a little less full of crap.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.720]   And a little less full of crap than Nielsen's, which are just kind of estimates, right?
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:15.720]   >> Why?
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:16.720]   I totally disagree.
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:25.160]   I think that, Leo, there are huge companies where- and I know several big media organizations
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.960]   that buy traffic at the end of every single month or right before the board meeting.
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:35.520]   And they have names like Web Monopoly and all kinds of obscure brand.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.400]   You can't even find them if you're looking for them.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:41.800]   >> You go and buy traffic, you buy clicks, and they may be bots, but they're more likely
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.640]   people sitting in Singapore- >> Jesus.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.800]   >> -- perhaps in the clicking away, following a script.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.680]   And this is known.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:55.720]   This online advertising with display ads is going to- it's a house of cards that will
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.720]   eventually come falling down.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:59.880]   >> It's funny, because people have been saying the same thing about television ratings for
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:03.520]   years because it's fairly bogus as well.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.920]   And the third little secret is nobody wants to admit it, and we all kind of conspire and
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.920]   go along with it.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:14.000]   >> But there's a lot more history, a lot more infrastructure built up around that.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000]   >> I guess.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.640]   I don't know if it's more accurate.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:18.640]   Let's take a break.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:19.640]   Come back with more.
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:24.760]   We just have a few more minutes with Adam Curry of agenda show.com.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.760]   >> No agenda show.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:27.760]   >> Oh, there is no agenda.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.000]   No agenda show.com.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.760]   >> Be careful now.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.760]   >> I know.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.040]   >> We're going to talk about the gun when we come back.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:37.840]   He's got a new weapon for us.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.840]   >> Show and tell.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.280]   >> Show and tell time.
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:42.280]   Mr. Sriracha, Eli Patel.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:44.680]   What do you carry around with you?
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:47.880]   Anytime you eat something, you just got to put a little Sriracha sauce on it.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:50.960]   >> No, I wanted a prop like Adam's, and I'm in the office.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.360]   I just looked on the table.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.360]   >> There it is.
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.120]   >> Watch out, man.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.600]   >> And what have you brought us, Mr. Robert Balliser?
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.600]   >> Google Glass.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.120]   >> Oh, he's number 118.
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:02.520]   >> That's the lowest number I've seen yet.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:03.520]   >> Ooh.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:08.240]   >> But this show brought to you by our friends out of New York City, Squarespace.com.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:14.800]   It's the best web hosting plus the best content management system to make your website sing
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:19.120]   a Squarespace.com.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:20.720]   I love it when a company does this.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:22.600]   You could try it free for 14 days.
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:24.960]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:26.440]   That means they believe in what they've got.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.840]   And they know that after you try it for 14 days, you're going to become a Squarespace
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:30.840]   customer.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:33.200]   That's because you get great designs.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:37.520]   This is the new Squarespace, completely written from the ground up.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:41.720]   One of the things they've done that's great, this new layout engine, is what they call
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:44.200]   responsive design.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:48.760]   So you design one page that works no matter what size the screen is.
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:52.880]   In fact, every time you put a picture on one of your Squarespace sites, it automatically
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.760]   makes seven different versions.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:59.800]   So if people are on there on an iPad or an iPhone or a 27-inch monitor, it's always going
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.280]   to look great.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.280]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:03.280]   You don't have to think about it.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:06.120]   It just works beautifully.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:12.960]   Great connections too with all of the major and even some of the minor services like Facebook,
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:20.480]   Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, stumbled upon Reddit, Twitter, 4-square.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.840]   Great commenting system.
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:22.840]   Very powerful.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:26.920]   Now that you get statistics, real-time stats, you get more statistics, more information
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:31.520]   about who's visiting your page and what they're doing than any other site I've seen.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.080]   It is fantastic.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.520]   I want you to try it free.
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:36.000]   Visit squarespace.com.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.080]   Just click that button that says get started and you'll be working with Squarespace before
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.080]   you know it.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:46.680]   You don't have to be a JavaScript programmer or a CSS HTML5 developer to use Squarespace.
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:50.080]   But if you are, by the way, they have coders with colored syntax, all the stuff that you
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.720]   need to be a great developer.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:52.720]   Then I got it.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:53.720]   It never goes down.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:54.720]   It never goes down.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:55.720]   We cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.640]   No agenda show.com is hosted on it.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:59.280]   It does not go down.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.520]   That says a lot.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.040]   We bring sites down all the time.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.560]   Never bring down a Squarespace site.
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:05.920]   And the pricing is amazing.
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:10.640]   $8 for the basic, but I want you to look at the $16 a month plan where you get unlimited
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:17.040]   pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors, and the custom domain
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:20.440]   when you sign up for a annual plan, that means you're going to get your domain name
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:21.440]   all hooked up.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:23.600]   You don't have to think about it.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.080]   Just a great deal.
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:26.440]   I want you to take a look at it right now.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:32.320]   If you decide to buy, do use our offer code TWIT8, 8 for the month of August, TWIT8,
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:35.320]   and you'll get 10% off the first purchase, which means you should buy an annual plan
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.880]   because that's where you get the best savings.
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:42.320]   Squarespace.com, everything you need to build an amazing website.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:47.720]   Use the offer code TWIT8 to save 10% off your first purchase.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:51.320]   Peter Thiel sells off the majority of his Facebook shares.
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.320]   He tells you something, right?
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.920]   The first investor in Facebook, does it mean anything?
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:54:00.720]   They're going to hit a billion users in any day now, a billion users?
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:02.240]   Half of which are fake.
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:03.560]   Well, a lot more.
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.560]   Or disused.
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.760]   But isn't that amazing, Adam?
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:09.280]   I mean, you at the beginning of the internet revolution, who would have thought that you'd
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.560]   have a billion people?
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:17.400]   Well, I'm also very skeptical about the billion number.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:22.120]   I think it's probably in the mid-100,000 range.
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:23.120]   Really that low?
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.880]   100 million range, I'm sorry.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:25.880]   100 million?
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:28.120]   Even that, that's the tenth of what they're claiming.
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:31.160]   Yeah, no, I'm certainly not believing that number.
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:32.680]   And it's a horrible metric for them.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.000]   They're trying to get away from this.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000]   They do not want to be measured by how many people there are.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000]   You always see them moving away from that.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:46.160]   And by the way, the way they calculate what a user means is someone who was interacted
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.400]   near this monthly user number.
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.440]   So if you've clicked on a like button, then you're counted as a user.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:52.640]   There's a whole bunch of tricks.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.320]   And they're really trying to get away from that.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.480]   Because the bottom line for them now is money and how their quarter is.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:00.320]   And more importantly, how they can predict.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:03.000]   You can have less revenue as long as you predict it.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.080]   That's what the market always wants.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.560]   I ran a public company, so I know what this is about.
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.880]   And again, I think the more users, there's just more bad news from them because they
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:17.840]   have not cracked the code, which is what I keep hearing all the analysts talk about,
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:22.240]   is cracking the code of making all of this display advertising valuable.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:27.920]   And they're trying to come up with the social graph and what other things you're connected
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:33.360]   to so they can know more about you and therefore put a value on you.
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:38.880]   It was funny, I was watching Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:39.880]   What's her name?
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:40.880]   Sandy?
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:41.880]   Sheryl Sandberg.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.360]   Sheryl Sandberg, thank you.
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:46.240]   They were at Walmart.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.840]   And it was a company meeting.
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:54.480]   And someone who listened to No Agenda had actually sent me video of this, which is very
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.120]   foreboding in the Walmart culture.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.880]   And Zuckerberg was on stage talking about his customers.
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:02.480]   I was like, that was the biggest joke ever.
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:08.920]   Like, yeah, our customers, meaning the users, it's absolutely just not true.
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:09.920]   So it's not good.
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.520]   But what he was selling is stock is very normal.
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:14.000]   I mean, this is his business.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.040]   His business is to invest early.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:19.120]   And then at the IPO, get out.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.320]   You didn't sell all of his holdings.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:24.080]   But that's a very normal process and very expected.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.360]   And I think the market reflected that appropriately.
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:33.520]   It didn't drop like a bombshell, but intrinsically everyone's seeing the writing on the wall.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:39.200]   And yet Facebook is meeting right now with Frank Geary to design the new Facebook headquarters
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:44.520]   which will have an entire forest on the roof apparently.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.080]   That here's Mark and Frank smiling and laughing as they look at the new model.
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:50.080]   Yeah, that's what you do.
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:51.600]   It's culture for these companies.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.600]   That's great.
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:55.560]   You've got your little twit cave thing.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:58.560]   Yeah, but I don't have a forest on the roof.
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:01.800]   They're good bricks, but I didn't have Frank Geary design it.
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.800]   That's pretty cool.
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:03.800]   I mean, they're still a strong company.
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:05.120]   They'll still make profit.
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.000]   They'll still be able to do anything.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]   I'm sorry, that's not true.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.720]   That's just not true.
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:15.720]   Even if we say they have only 100 or 200 million users, that's still a lot of users.
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:16.720]   It's a big number.
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:19.680]   Even if we say that they don't have a, they don't, we know they don't have a really good
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:22.040]   mobile strategy because they would have rolled it out by now.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:26.600]   We know that they don't have a really good strategy for monetizing the views, but they
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.720]   are making revenue.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.080]   They are profitable.
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:34.000]   So to say that it's a failed idea, that's being a bit harsh.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.880]   It's definitely not worth $100 billion.
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.520]   The profitability is arguable depending on how you count the numbers.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.680]   This is a very traditional trick.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:44.080]   They lease their infrastructure.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:48.560]   They finance that leasing amount, their cost of pushing, what is it?
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.960]   10 terabytes a day.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.720]   That's just for picture sharing.
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:55.440]   It's incredible that what their cost is.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:02.080]   I do not think that they are like a product company that sells widgets where actually all
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.600]   of their cost is less than what they're bringing.
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.280]   I don't think they're profitable in that manner.
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.000]   They have intrinsic value.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.160]   They have cash on hand.
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:14.480]   If you just look at the numbers, that puts them at about $7, $8 a share.
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.160]   That would be their actual value.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.160]   Wow.
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.760]   So they're not doing great.
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:26.080]   Their transit costs may not be as high as people think they might be because Facebook
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:30.840]   is really into the handshake rooms, the friendship rooms that they have in these big colos.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:34.440]   So they don't have to transit over, over, you know, massive pipes.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:38.680]   They're inside the same colos as all the other services that share the Facebook data.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:42.800]   There's absolute, of course, there's value to that in the way they've set that up, but
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:43.800]   it's not free.
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:44.800]   It's not free.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:45.800]   No.
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:51.680]   It's $700 million a year before the, when public is what their infrastructure costs.
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:52.680]   That's a lot of money.
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:53.920]   And we're financing that.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:57.640]   So I'm not going to buy any Facebook stock anytime soon.
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:59.320]   I think you've convinced me.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:01.200]   Even at $7 bucks, I'm not buying it.
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:04.640]   I think there's the, you know, I think Adam is arguing that the numbers is very convincing,
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:08.800]   but I think Facebook is the internet for a lot of people.
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:09.800]   Oh, no.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:10.800]   It really is.
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.000]   No, I mean, like it is.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.840]   That's what they go on the internet to do.
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:18.720]   And there's that they'll be able to figure out how to extract value from that.
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:22.040]   I mean, people go on the internet to look at Facebook and interact with their friends
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:24.480]   and then they go out from Facebook to the world.
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:25.840]   It's kind of like AOL though.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.320]   AOL was the internet for a while.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.320]   You know, it's funny about that.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.320]   And like GeoCities.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:31.920]   And we've seen this, we've seen this movie before.
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:34.280]   There is no value in that.
[01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:39.560]   When I worked at AOL, I used to hear a lot of grumpy old dudes by the vending machines
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:42.360]   say things like Facebook is just us again.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.360]   How come people don't give us any credit?
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.240]   Like, dude, you work at AOL.
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:50.680]   I'm like, I don't, I don't know that parading around saying you had this idea that you were
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:54.320]   the first Facebook is really going to get you laid in the bar tonight.
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.320]   You know, you can try.
[01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:00.840]   But at the time AOL was absolutely kicked ass.
[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:01.840]   It was amazing.
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:04.200]   You had the, oh, you've got mail and it was exciting.
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:08.400]   And then what happened is you had this gateway to this internet thing, which was like, oh,
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.400]   you're outside of the safe zone, the safe area.
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.600]   I remember it all really well.
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:13.560]   And we had a lot of services like this.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:16.400]   When you try to centralize the internet, it does not work.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:23.080]   The network sees it as a bug, routes around it, witness Twitter's deal with NBC.
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:24.960]   Everyone routed right around all of that.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.360]   From your ear to God's lips.
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:28.360]   No, the other way.
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:32.720]   Yeah, but the thing, but what the internet does prioritize over everything else is data,
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:33.720]   right?
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:39.480]   And Facebook is an amazing engine for generating data, draw direct data from people.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.840]   And that's where it lives.
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:43.040]   So you can route around it.
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:48.200]   The piece AOL never had was people dumping in gigabytes of information.
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:52.600]   And there's one thing the internet will work to achieve.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.160]   It's getting that information out.
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:57.760]   And I don't think Facebook has, as long as Facebook has that card, they're going to be
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.680]   in the driver's seat of how they make money.
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:03.080]   Because you're not going to get people to leave Facebook and start dumping their photos
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:06.680]   to share with their entire social networks that don't exist on Google+.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.480]   Like that's not happening yet.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:10.480]   Maybe that's all fine.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:15.480]   But I still don't see a real business model with actual value making more money than you're
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:16.480]   spending.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:18.280]   I just don't see the numbers taking place.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:21.320]   I completely agree with you on that piece of it because they got to figure it out.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.080]   Well, that's kind of important.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:24.080]   It is.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:30.800]   But I think there's a way, they're not going to route around being centralized because that's
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:31.800]   where the data lives.
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:34.160]   It is the fundamental debate though, isn't it?
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:36.360]   Will Facebook figure it out or not?
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:37.360]   Right.
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:38.360]   It comes down to that.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:39.360]   Does it not?
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:40.360]   Yeah.
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.280]   And everyone keeps saying, you know, they're going to crack the code.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.520]   Mobile is the place to be.
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:45.520]   Bull crap.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:46.520]   They have no code.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:48.600]   It's not, I just don't see it happening.
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:52.320]   We're seeing investing in large Zuckerberg's brilliance.
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:53.880]   So Adam, let me ask you this.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.000]   How do you make money because my business is going to fail because this play advertising
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000]   is going to work.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.440]   Facebook's business was just radically different is going to fail.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:07.440]   Leo, I mean, is Leo going to make money on the internet?
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:09.440]   How do you make money on the internet?
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.440]   I'm all right.
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:13.000]   It seems like you have a lot of money in real estate.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.440]   All right.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:16.840]   So Leo is clearly making money.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:22.080]   He's figured out the inventory, which is embedded within the programming, which is
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:24.160]   extremely valid and works.
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:28.560]   And we've opted for another model, which is value for value.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:30.000]   Like we give everything away.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.680]   We have no copyrights and a trademarks.
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:33.600]   If you like it, send us some money.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:35.840]   When you're talking about we need no agenda, of course.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.520]   Yeah, no agenda show.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:42.960]   And we have a clearly an outstanding product because people support us enough for us to
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:46.400]   just get by on the donations from the program.
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.440]   You make much money on that really seriously?
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.440]   No, enough to get by with the current.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:55.040]   Surprisingly, your funding model is a lot like my funding model.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.440]   Yeah, the church.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:57.440]   You pass it fast.
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:58.440]   It's not far from it.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:02.960]   In fact, it's a combination kind of of televangelism.
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:06.120]   But we are delivering a product that people like.
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.120]   So what are you up to?
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:13.160]   You have amazingly engaged and passionate fans.
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:14.160]   That's very clear.
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:17.600]   So let me ask you this, Adam, because this is the question I always want to ask.
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:23.720]   What would you estimate the value of your personal name and your brand is in raw marketing
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.320]   cost for the show?
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:28.680]   Because if I'm a kid in college and I just start a podcast that's just as good as your
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:31.320]   show, I won't get the audience, right?
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:34.560]   Because I know that's a red herring.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:37.640]   I think that's absolutely, people don't know me anymore.
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.240]   I'm going to be 48 in two weeks.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.240]   I think that people still, people walking around and remembering from head bangers ball.
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:45.240]   I don't know.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:46.240]   I've asked Valley.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.240]   Let me tell you one thing.
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:50.800]   I made a value from coming out this week at Tech.
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:54.280]   This is where people say, oh, this guy's nuts or Dvorak's a grouch.
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:55.680]   What he's doing a show over there?
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.160]   Let me go check it out.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.360]   I'd say 80% of our initial audience came from this show.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.360]   Sure.
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:04.760]   No, I was literally asking me, you estimated zero.
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:05.600]   I think that's fair.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:10.840]   But I, you know, I'm wondering how, you know, that model of we're going to give it away,
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:13.520]   we'll give everything away and people can just pay us if they like it.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:14.520]   There's not a lot of certain.
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:15.520]   No, no, no, it's different.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:16.520]   I'm sorry.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:18.560]   It's exactly the same.
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:25.440]   We're providing a product and we ask people the question, did you obtain value from this?
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:26.960]   And what do you think the value is?
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:31.560]   That's different from we're giving it away and send us something if you like it.
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:40.640]   We're asking that question specifically and we do provide some very set pieces like mentioning,
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:45.400]   thanking people for their donations on each episode, making people, executive producers
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:47.320]   or associate executive producers.
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.720]   It is a model that I think will work for other products that are out there on the internet.
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:53.600]   It's not the only one.
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:59.360]   But for sure, for sure, display advertising is not the way to go, inventing the commercial
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:03.400]   message, which was the original idea behind podcasting, the original idea.
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:07.280]   People out there still remember if I burped that that's the senseo machine.
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:08.280]   The original.
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:09.280]   That's right.
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:10.280]   Right.
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:15.280]   So let me just embed the commercials in the programming and you can, even with a small
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:17.400]   audience, make enough money to get by.
[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:22.560]   I'm not saying that we're going to see the days of big companies making hundreds of billions
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:25.440]   of dollars, but maybe that's just not the future in general.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.440]   Okay.
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:32.040]   So let me ask you, how do I embed the commercials in my editorial, right, on the verge?
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:34.560]   Because to me, it sounds like very, very complicated.
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.400]   Actually, you do do it.
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:37.400]   Wait a minute.
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.160]   You have sponsored posts on the verge.
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:40.160]   No, we do not.
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:41.320]   Absolutely not.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:42.720]   I would quit in a heartbeat.
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.720]   Well, wait a minute.
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:44.720]   Let me see.
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:45.720]   You tell me what this is.
[02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:46.720]   I'm going to scroll down and you explain what this is then.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:50.000]   I don't, maybe it's not a sponsored post right here.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.360]   What to hear, see and read the editor's top picks presented by Starbucks refreshers,
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.360]   beverage.
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:56.360]   Yeah.
[02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:57.360]   So they, they bought the ad space.
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:58.360]   So as an ad.
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.360]   Yeah, it's an ad.
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.320]   I mean, that's like whatever they bought.
[02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:02.960]   They bought the tag favorite.
[02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:03.960]   Is that an interstitial?
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:04.960]   You clicked on that.
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:05.960]   I clicked on the ad.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:08.880]   I clicked the link there, not the link here, I guess.
[02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:09.880]   Yeah, there we go.
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:10.880]   There we go.
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:15.560]   So yeah, they bought a banner ad on that top, that thing, but they didn't say do this.
[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:16.560]   Got it.
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.560]   Got it.
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:18.560]   It's not legal.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.160]   That's your question without, without hitting your back browser.
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.880]   What ad did you just see that popped up?
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:25.600]   That was the Starbucks refresher ad.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:26.600]   It worked.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:27.600]   Yeah.
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:29.600]   Might have helped because I've seen that.
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:30.600]   I've seen that.
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:31.600]   Starbucks right now.
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:33.760]   You know, I already know about refreshers and they discussed me.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:34.760]   I don't believe in Starbucks.
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:36.960]   That's a horrible, horrible company.
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:44.200]   But to kind of bring it back to where is the money being made?
[02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:48.800]   There are most definitely models, but we still have a lot of breaking to do.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:54.160]   We've seen the print model is completely obliterated.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:57.320]   And I think I know nothing about the verge.
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:00.120]   I don't know if you're making money, if you're profitable.
[02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:02.320]   I have no idea whatsoever.
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:08.560]   But I don't know if this type of display advertising is viable long term.
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:10.920]   I really question that.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:15.280]   And unfortunately with written content, it's very, very complicated.
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:16.280]   The very challenging.
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:19.080]   The verge of the verge of Vox Media is actually quite interesting.
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:22.760]   What they did with SB Nation and now what they're doing with the verge.
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:23.920]   Seems to me.
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:26.920]   And what they're doing with our third site polygon is launched a couple months.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:28.240]   I mean, that's the game.
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.240]   Is that going to be gaming?
[02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:30.240]   Is that it?
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:31.240]   That's gaming.
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:37.440]   Look, I don't want to sound like I'm defensive here, but this is what I do.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:38.440]   This is my living.
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:44.160]   And my living is trying to create the best journalism on the web that we can using the
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:45.160]   tools made it.
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:46.720]   And somebody has to pay for this journalism.
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:47.720]   Right.
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:51.360]   And it's either we can ask everybody to subscribe to the verge, which I think is.
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:59.040]   By the way, this is coming from the same guy who said I want to have sports for free.
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:01.720]   You want to be paid for the great programming you provide.
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:06.120]   I mean, you understand kind of where the twist is in that.
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:07.920]   But it's all about where the value is coming from, right?
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:10.840]   For NELI, his organization creates great content.
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:12.400]   That's where the value comes from.
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:17.000]   For Facebook, it's the fact that their users are willing to dump in all this data, which
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000]   can then be sold to advertisers.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.200]   That's where the value comes from.
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:25.520]   For Adam, it's the fact that he's willing to do this wonderful, just, I don't even know
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:29.040]   what to call it, orgy of weird things.
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:31.040]   And people are willing to give money for.
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:35.080]   That's when the value comes from.
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:38.520]   All I'm saying is, yes, of course, there's value, there's money.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:44.320]   I just don't think that the business is based on display advertising, have a viable long-term
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:45.320]   future.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:46.320]   Is Facebook making money?
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:47.320]   Yeah.
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:48.800]   Will they make a lot of money moving forward?
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:49.800]   Maybe not.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:50.800]   How will this work?
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:54.720]   You know, this exact same model with editorial sites like the verge?
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:55.720]   I don't know.
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:09:00.840]   I mean, but I don't, just my opinion, I don't think it has a long-term viable future.
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.360]   Something is going to have to change.
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:06.560]   We see how Kickstarter has changed what people think about products.
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:07.560]   They want to be in control.
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:12.720]   They're more than willing, and Leo, you're a big fan of this, here's 50 bucks.
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:16.520]   Go make the product, and I'll buy the product for $300 from you.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.520]   That's the future.
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:18.520]   That's where it's going.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:22.240]   People want to be in control of the products they're consuming, and they will pay for it.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:26.920]   You just have to figure out, you know, what is the ultimate amount that people are going
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:27.920]   to pay?
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:33.920]   If you took away, if you'd look at the cable cutters, $200 a month, it's probably a little
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:38.680]   bit above average, but it's somewhere between $100 and $200 that people are paying for entertainment.
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:44.560]   Man, that's a lot of shows you can get for $199 an episode once those costs are in line
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:46.960]   with the amount of people who are willing to pay for that.
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.960]   But Facebook is an entirely visual advertising.
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:53.520]   I mean, a lot of the Facebook business models, the fact that you can build social advertising.
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:54.520]   You get enough people...
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:55.920]   That's what they keep getting in trouble for, though.
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:58.320]   And they keep getting in trouble for it, but that's why they keep doing it, because they
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.600]   know that's something that no one else has.
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:06.320]   If I can get enough of your friends to like my product, you'll like my product.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.880]   I don't see how you can measure that value or what the value is.
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:11.880]   Don't you think...
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:13.120]   We're going to end this anyway.
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:14.120]   We're almost out of time.
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:15.120]   Yeah.
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.120]   I've got to show my gun.
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:18.400]   And it's a great topic, which I would love to go into, but don't you think that it is
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.840]   possible that it really...
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:24.080]   What really matters is the engagement of the audience, the commitment of the audience,
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:27.720]   and whether it's display advertising or selling producerships.
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.960]   If you have an engaged audience, if you have an audience that loves the Verge or loves no
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:34.880]   agenda show, that they will make it work somehow.
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:38.040]   I mean, they click on display ads because they want to support the Verge.
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:39.040]   I mean, I do think that...
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:40.960]   That's not great for the advertiser.
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:43.120]   The advertiser doesn't want you clicking on ads.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:44.520]   They want you to buy their product.
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:46.720]   They people buy products because they like the Verge.
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:47.720]   They go, "Okay.
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:51.760]   If Ford is associated with the Verge, I like Ford because I love the Verge.
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:54.160]   I do think that there is some value in that.
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:55.400]   I understand what you're saying.
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:59.680]   The display ads, as a model, it's brought over that doesn't work.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:02.240]   It's a part of an overall strategy, Leo.
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:05.040]   The Ford doesn't only advertise on the Twitter.
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:06.040]   No.
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:11.400]   It's an enhancement and it's a part of an overall package to reaching a very specific audience.
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.400]   Precisely.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:15.600]   And it's tied very much to how that audience feels about the product they're consuming,
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:17.760]   whether it's Twitter, the Verge.
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:18.760]   And that's important.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:24.080]   And that's a way, maybe, that makes display ads more valuable than just a display ad.
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.280]   We're no longer talking to magazine with a full-page ad for Macy's in it.
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:29.440]   There's something else going on in here.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:32.080]   And you're brilliant at exploiting that.
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:36.360]   I mean, no agenda show clearly shows how valuable an engaged audience is.
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:39.040]   And I don't know how to measure engagement.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.240]   I know it's an audience that will send money.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.240]   Right.
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:43.240]   I suspect that's okay.
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:44.240]   Yeah.
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:50.080]   And I suspect it's the same kind of engagement that drives traffic to advertisers from our
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.200]   shows or the Verge.
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:54.160]   But anyway, let's see the gun.
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:55.160]   Okay.
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:57.600]   So this is also a collector's item.
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.920]   And by the way, I thought I kind of had the patent on bringing firearms onto this week
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:03.920]   attack.
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:04.920]   I'm a little upset.
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:09.320]   It turned out that the Kevin Pereira gun was merely one of those soft, what do they
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:10.320]   call it?
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.320]   Airsoft things.
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:12.320]   So it doesn't count.
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:13.320]   Okay.
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:14.320]   I'm a little bit of a damno.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:15.320]   So that's different.
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:16.320]   Yes.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:17.800]   I had this is actually a collector's item.
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:23.160]   It is a zero number 128, which is why I bought it because it's actually a really crappy gun.
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.360]   This is the Ruger zombie slayer.
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:29.400]   And if you can see the letters right there.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:30.920]   The fire silver bullets.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:32.560]   What makes that a zombie slayer?
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:33.560]   What's the calendar?
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:35.640]   No, it actually has a green tipped bullets.
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:37.200]   It's a three 80.
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.280]   So it's a very powerful handgun.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:41.280]   Sweet.
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:43.920]   It's an LCPZ.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:47.880]   And this is marketed as a gun you need to have for the zombie apocalypse.
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:49.640]   I'm running to Austin.
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:51.280]   What the minute I hear about the hobby.
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:54.440]   You always have a place for a sandwich in Austin.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.960]   I love you Adam Curry.
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:58.520]   You are just always provocative, always interesting.
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.080]   And noagendicehow.com is a great show.
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:02.080]   Everybody must listen to.
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:03.600]   Thank you so much for having me on again.
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:04.600]   I really enjoy it.
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:05.600]   No, I do too.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:07.120]   And you always bring great ideas.
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.160]   I completely disagree with the moon thing, but you know, it's okay.
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:13.160]   We can agree to disagree with that.
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:14.160]   Yeah.
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:15.840]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:19.600]   Thank you to Niele Patel, who has done, you and the Verge have done such a great job.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:25.040]   I really do think it has now become the premier source for technology news, not just gadget
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.080]   news, but really for technology news.
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:28.080]   And that's a big transformation.
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:31.480]   It's going to be sad when our business fades away.
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:33.320]   Yeah, I'll miss you.
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:34.320]   I just want to.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:37.160]   I just wish you the best with that display ad thing.
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:39.400]   No, well, it's been great.
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:43.280]   I think, look, I don't know how to make money on the Internet.
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.640]   It's not your job.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.280]   You know how to make content.
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:47.280]   That's your job.
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:48.280]   And you know what?
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:49.280]   You do.
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:50.280]   You do exactly how to make it.
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.680]   You made money by getting a great job with someone who's willing to pay you.
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:53.680]   There you go.
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:54.680]   You value for value.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:55.680]   That's the key.
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:56.680]   That's the key.
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:57.680]   That's the key.
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:58.680]   Yep.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:13:59.840]   And anyway, it's always good to have you Niele.
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:00.840]   I appreciate it.
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:02.000]   It's always fun to be on the show.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.000]   Really great.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.600]   And of course, Robert Ballester, the host of this week at Enterprise Tech, is going to
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.360]   give us a final function because we've just pretty much killed it.
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:11.360]   What is that?
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:12.760]   We have to week ahead.
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:14.120]   I forgot the week ahead.
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:15.200]   Oh my God.
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.400]   Let's quickly before we wrap up, Tom, he's back.
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:19.400]   Tom Merritt is here.
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:20.720]   Let's see what this is a big week.
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:21.720]   Let's see what we've got.
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:22.720]   Hey, thanks Leo.
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:24.680]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead.
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:28.760]   Monday, August 27th, the Xbox Live election 2012 hub.
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:32.520]   Go on the Xbox VM world kicks off in San Francisco.
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:33.520]   Yeah.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:36.560]   Tuesday, August 28th, the job on Jam, our customers get the option to come.
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:40.360]   Customize colors of the grill and caps of their jam box that they weren't.
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:41.360]   There's a story.
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:43.200]   Sneaked in early Wednesday, August 29th.
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.840]   Samsung Unpacked happens in Berlin.
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:48.920]   We're pretty much expecting it to be a new Galaxy Note.
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:52.520]   And Thursday, August 30th, comics kicks off in Singapore.
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:56.680]   An internet cat video film festival takes place in the house.
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:58.680]   The scenes project Greenlight begins.
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:01.080]   All that and more on Tech News today this week.
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:03.080]   If you care about Tech News, thank you Tom Merritt.
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:10.360]   You got to watch Tech News today, 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern Time, 1700 UTC Monday through

[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:21.280]   Another twin is in the can.
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:22.280]   Easy.
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.280]   Yeah.
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:24.280]   Thank you everybody.
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:24.280]   Wow.
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:30.040]   Two in the twin.
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:32.720]   (upbeat music)
