[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. There is a lot to talk about, including the new
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.680]   coronavirus, the novel coronavirus, its closed mobile world congress. What's it going to do
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.880]   to iPhone production and the future of conferences in general? We'll also talk about
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.520]   augmented reality glasses. Apparently there's a pretty good kind and is Google's new OS called
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:29.280]   Pigweed? It's all coming up next on Twit. This week in Tech comes to you from Twit's

[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.400]   It's time for Twits this week in Tech. Show where we cover the week's tech news with the best panel
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.640]   I can assemble on short notice joining us right now for the first time on Skype. Usually Alex is
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.040]   in studio with us but he's now moved to Rhode Island and he's coming to us from my childhood home
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.440]   the beautiful Breakers Mansion in Newport Rhode Island at Alex Wilhelm and you have a new job Alex.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.240]   I do. I'm back at TechCrunch.com. My old home and now my new home once again and it's been about
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.520]   two months and it's been lovely. Generally it's time to report or what do you cover?
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.600]   I'm covering the startup market and venture capital trends broadly. I will admit that I
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.120]   bias a little bit towards the late stage market as opposed to the early stage but certainly there's
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.760]   a lot going on so I'm quite busy and enjoying getting back in the groove as it were. You don't
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.640]   mind actually working for a living instead of just editing stuff. You know actually what's really
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.520]   funny is editing is probably more stress but reporting is more work and I'm much rather have
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.880]   more work than stress so I'm liking the switch back. Does that make sense? Is that right Daniel
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.080]   Rubino? Daniel's also here. He's the executive editor at Windows Central that means you have to
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.760]   work or you have stress. Yeah although I'm not very good at editing. I edit in the programming
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.120]   sense. You don't ever want me to grammar check you because I will miserably fail in that.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.680]   You're not well in the old days they'd have a copy editor to do that. We have that now. You do?
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.840]   Oh yeah we have a managing editor and we have a couple of duty editors who
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.680]   thankfully handle all that and Grammarly has got a long wait. Thank you Grammarly.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.080]   Copy editor of choice. I'm going to ask you a question for the data. #sponsored for the data
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.760]   generation. Great to have you Daniel also with us from CBS Dan Patterson from CBS.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.000]   Great to see you as always. Senior producer. Producers are not they're not they're more working
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.120]   folk folk. Oh always. I'm effectively a reporter but reporter with a producer title and
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.880]   embedded so I report to and through CNET but we have wonderful colleagues as we'll talk about
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.720]   later Hadoop. Gadget cell phone. Right. That kind of thing. At CBS News which is I report
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.960]   there every day and I report through them I report more on the core technologies. So AI,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.480]   cyber security, big data, the emergence of I. Were you very busy talking about the shadow app
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.280]   during the Iowa caucus? Yeah you know strangely I grew up in Iowa and we actually put my parents
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   on there to give a an authentic take from Iowa and we you know we are CBS News we are OTT.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.360]   CBS News.com/live if you want like smart hard news and not like pundits yelling at each other.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.520]   Our analysts do a really good job. I actually have been looking for that. Both Lisa and I
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.800]   have kind of gotten sick of the 24 hour news channels because they don't do news so much as
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.160]   commentary all the time. And this is often obsessively about one little thing for hours.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.080]   Right well as you have to do you know very well that if you're 24 hours live you have to
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.800]   cover things sometimes. Yeah. And with with love and respect to our colleagues at other networks
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.320]   and other media companies we do live news with smart analysts really well it's CBS News.com/live
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.720]   it's free. I don't mean this to sound like a plug but if you really want to see.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.120]   I'm looking for something. Segments of like here is what's going on with coronavirus.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.240]   Yes. Here is what's going on with stuff that is under covered under reported but is still news.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:07.520]   We do this really well it is streaming all the time with real anchors, real news, real correspondence
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:15.200]   but it's audio not video right. No it's video. Oh it's TV. It's TV. Yeah it's live TV. CBS News.com/live.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.680]   So this is just it is like like it's just news. It's just news. I remember news. Remember that?
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.560]   Remember that? You'd have news like they'd say here's what's going on.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.200]   Right it's nonpartisan. So if you want this is what I do 24 hours a day and my colleagues do
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.720]   exceptionally well which is smart hard news in a nonpartisan fashion. You got a new list.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.480]   Our viewer. Yeah. So and my colleagues at CNET are wonderful as well you know the CNET
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.720]   YouTube channel is fantastic. It is a place to go to not just be entertained but edified.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.120]   I mean CNET's YouTube channel is a ton of fun. I just spend more of my time reporting on the
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.640]   technologies that influence the news. Well and I remember Dan you you know kind of made your
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.600]   name embedding during the was it 2012 election or the 2008 election. Yeah I've covered it.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.600]   Leo as everybody on this panel knows the media industry has its ups and downs. I've been very
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.880]   fortunate in 2008, 12 and 16 to cover tech on presidential campaigns. So that's New Hampshire
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.040]   primary South Carolina, Florida, Iowa and the conventions and I always try to focus on again
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.120]   nonpartisan but here's how tech is influencing the world around us. Here is why tech is not just
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.000]   a vertical that is you know full of business stories but is deeply intertwined with every
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.680]   news story that you interact with. That is what's happening with technology. I think as your show
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.400]   is evolved that is definitely one of the dominant themes that I've seen with TWIT over the last
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.000]   10 years. Yeah I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing but you know. That's fair.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:10.320]   It's certainly fair. I feel like tech reporting used to be about things and now it's more about
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.560]   people if that and society than it used to be which I think a lot of our listeners say can you just
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.680]   it's funny I got an email yesterday from somebody saying can you talk less about phones on all
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.320]   about Android and it's like I'm sorry what do you want to hear what you want to talk about.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.800]   So we can never make anybody completely happy and then I hear people say less politics more
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.000]   gadgets and then people say but the problem is I think that tech has now become it's a different
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.680]   thing than it was 15 and 20 years ago when I started and we talk about different things and
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.880]   well for instance mobile world congress which normally the conversation is what new phones are
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.240]   going to be announced next week what's going to happen now the conversation is how the coronavirus
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:01.920]   COVID-19 has shut the conference down they decided not to go ahead and do it because
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:09.280]   too many people had already bailed frankly at some point it's only reporters were going oh sorry
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.920]   yeah the reporters with nobody to cover yeah were you gonna go Alex was that on your agenda
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.080]   no no I'm not a huge phone guy but I just kept seeing people cancel their presentations and at
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.600]   some point really it was only like eight reporters I follow on twitter that were still planning on
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.200]   going and maybe they would have their own party right but certainly it wouldn't have been the
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:36.240]   good time to go to Barcelona for sure the pricing has dropped yeah Daniel were you going
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.520]   yeah I was it's funny because I've been taking off to the last couple years from mobile
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.160]   congress windows phone kind of went away right but then again we went last year because
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.480]   Microsoft was there with HoloLens 2 it was a big announcement yeah right and they were
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.120]   gonna be there this year again and what's interesting about mobile world congress is the phone stuff has
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.880]   become almost less interesting as everybody does like Samsung does their own separate announcement
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:06.160]   as we saw this week but now we're starting to see with connected PCs and how mobile technology is
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.640]   more than just phones now right so uh mobile congress in that sense it's been interesting to
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.000]   watch it transform it's iot it's 5g it's phones it's computers it's handheld and now
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.960]   you know we'll talk about later foldable phones and devices like this stuff is like really exciting
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.280]   so um i was kind of disappointed obviously with a lot of reporters were too about mobile world
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.160]   congress but as Alex was saying soon as some of those companies started dropping out Amazon and
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.840]   AT&T it just started snowballing and then the conversation became all right who's cancelling
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.960]   next should we start going and once that starts you know i feel bad for a g sma they really didn't
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.680]   have much recourse here and you know they tried putting on the show but you know once you have
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.240]   all these big companies drop out in that that air going around that about you know should this
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.960]   continue it's hard to recover from it it stinks for i don't feel bad for AT&T
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.520]   Amazon Microsoft forget those companies they have tons of money they're going to be able to fly
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.320]   their people around and do their announcements it's about the small startups this is really their
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.000]   event where to get to kind of get a make-up break moment and they don't have that now and that's
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.240]   real unfortunate i wonder what the future of conferences holds yeah i mean a conference if
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.080]   you think about it is worse than a cruise ship
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.480]   you get so many ways it's so many ways you get more people uh it was more than 100,000 people
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.600]   expected at mobile world congress they're all in a few meeting rooms they're all shaking hands
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.800]   they're all talking face to face that's what a conference is is is is is that person to person
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:43.040]   connection and it's a breeding ground for virus is we're very lucky ces was not hit by coronavirus
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.080]   that could have been a nightmare scenario and people will take it back with them right wherever
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.120]   they go to afterwards i mean you're literally creating an infection point it's quite scary um
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.520]   i think we're starting to see the economic impacts of coronavirus i mean uh i was going
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.880]   through the the run and i never gonna talk about iphone production at some point but like this is
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.480]   the sort of thing that begins to snowball into real economic impact it's canceled flights it's
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.960]   canceled hotels it's canceled spin canceled ad spend i mean this is a lot of money a hundred
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.760]   thousand people is no joke and it's one example billion dollars for Barcelona that's what's there
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:20.560]   you go off billion and fox con is plants are just not uh effect they've they instead of making
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.840]   the new iphones which they were rumored to be working on new iphones they've been making face masks
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:35.840]   surgical masks um we're not doctors we're not experts on this thing uh so i'm one one you know
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.720]   dream of asking you if this is a reasonable precaution or not i'm getting the sense
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.160]   more and more from the people i talked to who are following this who are physicians that it is
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:54.240]   that china has kind of buried how bad it's gotten and the potential risks of coronavirus and so
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.560]   uh apparently i just talked to somebody earlier today was that china shut down there is nothing
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.320]   going on no one's going to the movies no one's going the streets are empty people are staying home
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.760]   speaking of the new tons articles yeah yeah they've done tremendous coverage as well as the
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.720]   daily podcast has really done a great job of taking you inside what's happening uh and not
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.480]   just reporting but kind of giving you a human feel of what these cities of 11 million people
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.720]   feel like when they're shut down yeah um i you know we've been preparing for this we we thought it
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.160]   was the zombie apocalypse but uh we've been preparing for this for a few years i hope we are well
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:43.040]   prepared for at some point there will be a 1918 style pandemic and because uh in the modern
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:50.800]   world compared to 1918 people travel everywhere freely constantly uh it's a very scary uh scary
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.200]   thought true i wonder if this is the same time things have gotten better in the medical world so
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.600]   maybe it'll be kind of a balancing act and it won't get much worse i'm trying to be an optimist about
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.520]   this because china as we said has locked down like 760 million people according to the new york times
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.120]   and the rest of the world's working very hard in conjunction with one another to figure out
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.800]   a vaccine and so forth so i'm trying to be an optimist i don't want to get all pessimistic about
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.960]   this but the the 1918 example certainly is uh pretty darn terrifying if that hit today because
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.880]   as leo said the spread would be much more likely the reason the 1918 was so bad is it was the end
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.480]   of world where when you had a lot of troops coming home so they did in effect spread it
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.800]   throughout and millions died um and i don't know what this is going to look like but you're right
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.440]   but we're simultaneously better prepared and less prepared we're more at higher risk and
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.760]   better prepared go ahead and it really tests this idea that we've had in technology in large part
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:51.120]   because the the economy for the last ten years has been uh pretty good but this idea of just in
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.720]   time delivery that not only are the supply chains but the distribution networks are all
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:03.600]   stacked in a way that you can order and acquire almost anything and this is because of these
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:10.080]   interrelated uh and nobody keeps anything in stock everything is done just in time so any
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.960]   hickening in a biotic right any hick up along the supply chain affects the whole supply chain
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.800]   everything comes to a halt uh i'm our next big conference is coming up in san francisco in two
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.640]   weeks it's rsa the big security conference already ibm has withdrawn
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:32.000]   uh they withdrew yester on friday saying uh the health of ibmers is our primary concern
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.960]   i don't know if that's overreacting i mean we do have i think there's one or two bay area i think
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.240]   there's one bay area case of coronavirus but any conference that brings people in from all over
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.080]   the world especially from china uh is i guess to be something to be worried about the problem is
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:55.280]   ibm is a platinum sponsor so withdrawing even in the rsa says well that's only 0.79 of the total number
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:06.080]   of attendees okay but this is how it begins isn't it yeah i was just in san francisco uh last week and
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.600]   i wasn't sure what to expect in terms of face masks and and fear uh but i was i was happy
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.160]   slash worried to see that no one was wearing face masks more than uh i'd seen historically in
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.520]   the city i only just moved out so like i'm still relatively up to date but uh in the airports uh
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.320]   new work and you know providence in sfo and even flights and even on the ground just nothing so
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.920]   this is not an american thing we're just not into the face mask thing it's kind of weird it's very
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.720]   much a cultural i mean i know again you guys are not happy to me all wearing face masks the guys at
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   costco this i was there this this week in the in the east bay and there were several costco
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.360]   employees interesting masks i guess and just anecdotally it's been hard to get on the new york
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.800]   city subway without seeing a handful of face masks yeah yeah i can imagine you know i'm coming out
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:58.400]   in public i might wear a face mask why not let's be prudent yeah yeah it is debate about it too i
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.880]   think it's better for people who may be infected to not spread versus those who uh worry about catching
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.760]   it because i don't know there's something to make the green mask gotten moisture builds up and it's
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.000]   actually better breeding ground like there's like some debate about the need to rotate your masks
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.480]   have five or six in every few minutes and i think the people that i've seen wearing masks were actually
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:26.080]   people who were sick rather than people who are afraid to get up and people so i'm not an
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:31.200]   epidemiologist uh initially they said the coronavirus is too heavy to be worried about airborne
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:37.040]   distribution watch surfaces wash your hands the latest thing i read from w h o is it is airborne
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.400]   a mask could be helpful you should still wash your hands and you know stay home
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.640]   you know Alex Alex your point of optimism i wonder if you will see at least around the venture
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.920]   and startup communities a shift a reorganizational shift in how people work if this pushes more
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:02.800]   remote work and if it optimizes the efficiencies of remote work and as a result maybe startups that
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:09.520]   do just that not just create remote software uh but optimize and really push what you can do
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:16.320]   remotely with teams i don't know maybe just having a little too optimistic but that's ironic with
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.560]   IBM who's been they reversed their policy of remote work and have made all their 350,000
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.160]   employees go back to hubs and get ready for this we make people come to work here because we
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:34.480]   found that people who work at home don't do anything so so that is the classic view but i want to
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.960]   like to dance point about startups and remote work and all of that it is increasingly common
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.560]   for startups to have offices outside the Bay Area even if they're headquarters there that's been a
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.880]   trend that's been going on for some time but i really think the remote work trend exploded when
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.600]   software got a lot better between slack and zoom you really do have a really high level of
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.480]   fidelity for remote work to kind of keep people in sync but i'm curious if we'll see another layer
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.160]   of innovation for like remote conferences for example that was a third on twitter about that
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.400]   today because so many conferences are being canceled maybe we need to kind of let go of the
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.960]   idea that we all need to go to Barcelona for nwc even though the food's good and everyone seems
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.000]   to have a great time maybe that's just not the way to approach product releases and so forth down
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.800]   the road video chat's good i mean we're all for here chatting in real time and yeah we don't have
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.960]   to breathe on each other it's you know i want to smell the over once you know it's nice
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.240]   the only downside to that is i think is that uh you know a lot of this in terms of reporting
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.800]   even deals being made does happen and sort of you know outside of the main events and
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.880]   you know chatting with people off the record and all this and that you lose when you have like
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:43.600]   official you know stream conference type events there's a lot it's just that face-to-face is kind
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:50.000]   of important isn't it yeah very important yeah and if you're you you mentioned the classic case of a
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.560]   small startup that is hoping that mobile world congress will be the place they can make their
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.600]   debut to the public there's a lot of press maybe they're gonna get some traction and that's an
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.320]   opportunity lost and i don't know how they can duplicate that over the internet you just you're
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.560]   swamped over the internet now i'm making the point you just brought up about um things being
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.480]   having the background and so forth my favorite ces story that i have is i was talking to Microsoft
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.920]   before ces this was probably 2015 or something so back in the day and i asked if saucya was going
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.600]   and they're like no like okay cool that's fine i won't try to get any of his time if he's not
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.760]   gonna be there and then i was there and there goes saucya blasting by me with like a whole
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.440]   entourage of people and i'm like what the hell like oh he's not officially here he's just talking
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.680]   to some people and i'm like that's the same thing and anyway people really do show up and do that
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.000]   kind of back channel stuff so i don't have a way to replicate that but certainly it would be cool
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.920]   if there's a backup option maybe for conferences if they do have to cancel for whatever reason
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.680]   they do have something other than just nothing which is your reality yeah remember remember
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.000]   that facebook had that really horrible virtual reality world that you would go into and nobody
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.480]   had any butts or legs or whatever and i still have it i still have it well i i was just with a
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.480]   startup in uh zurik who is doing exactly that they have offices in hong kong in south america
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.160]   in north america and it is maybe a little ludicrous with how technology is now but i think five
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.720]   seven years from now this could be far more common and they were their entire work day i know
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.880]   everyone looks nerdy with uh VR headset on but everyone was sitting around a table with a VR
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.840]   headset on working remotely with colleagues all over the world it was fascinating yeah there's
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.240]   quite a few companies to work on that technology so i don't think it just gets into that whole thing
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.400]   about VR and catching on to the mainstream would holland's b could it be could be used that way
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:39.600]   that's the kind of thing that they do have the hollow transportation they call it with the working
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.400]   with skype and stuff like that you know so mixed that's a more mixed reality type situation which
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.680]   could be interesting for demos um yeah there's opportunity there right so it's uh there if any
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   group should be able to solve this problem it should be tech conferences like usually mobile
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.960]   ones so you know there's hope i have to wonder you know it's hard to predict which way this is
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:05.040]   going to go if it ends up being a global pandemic and millions die which is a possibility i think
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.240]   maybe something will happen other but otherwise i think people just forget about it as we forgot
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.000]   about sars and merrs and and uh and just you know next year everybody just go to conferences again
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.840]   or what do you think you think this is a long term the beginning of the end for conferences
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.880]   it depends on you know what Alex was talking about with the economy i mean so we're hearing a lot
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.280]   of implications for china and we saw you know a lot of companies especially tech
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.760]   reporting their earnings in the last two weeks and they're now accounting for the coronavirus
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.600]   for next quarter and a production yeah this is going to be an issue yeah in production
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.080]   and so you know once that source that happened and slows down like that could really have dramatic
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.680]   impacts there's also that other story that we'll probably cover with china you know we're just a
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.240]   surveillance state and but this is a case where they're starting to use their surveillance technology
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.600]   to help in this situation this is the dangerous thing about privacy and security is when you
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.080]   find that one instance of like oh this is actually good use of this intrusive security state uh because
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.440]   it helps you know protect people it's an app right that reports isn't that when people get scared
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:14.720]   and and this is this is that's why nine eleven really hurt our country because the effect of
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:22.320]   it was we got scared and so once you get scared then you support security over freedom over liberty
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:31.680]   and uh well you you mentioned this china has a close contact detector app that they encourage
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:39.120]   you to download on your phone you do a uh you scan a quick response code on your smartphone
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.160]   and then the app once it's registered with a phone number you enter your name and your
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.520]   national ID number and then they can tell you if you had close contact with anybody
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.520]   who has coronavirus because they know where everybody else has been they know where you have been
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:01.440]   close contact means you were in the same train car with somebody who has coronavirus
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:07.200]   or you uh if you were on a plane you were within a few rows three rows of an infected person
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:14.000]   or I mean they they really know everywhere you've been and and I don't think they see
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.640]   revealing this as a disadvantage this might be a good thing yeah and a behavioral beta test for
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.080]   what could be deployed in west or other places and if we get scared enough we might take it
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:32.480]   yeah well I mean we yeah America will I mean I think there's a there's always going to be a
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.120]   contingent of the u.s government that wants more control and and stuff like this that's the
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.080]   problem is it starts oh we're going to protect you from coronavirus but the end game is and we're
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.520]   going to keep an eye on everywhere you go every time you go anywhere and there will be no more
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.120]   dissidents yay protests are over yay and then you wonder what happens with this collides with
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.960]   the anti-vaxxers in the United States if even a vaccine comes out for this right so it's like
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:02.000]   well there's um and then you have fake news and all that's like yeah there's a lot of potential
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.480]   here for some just really nasty stuff coming out and I you know I want to be an optimist like
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.320]   Alex but you know there it can go both ways I think it is way more interesting
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:20.960]   pressing Alex that's our goal here America's response to the 1918 flu epidemic in part
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:28.160]   was to force people to vaccinate against the flu oh yeah there you go so when the anti-vaxxers start
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:35.280]   being forced by the government to take vaccine twitter will be real fun well and we'll see these
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.640]   strong rates of disinformation floating across sock puppet accounts and bot accounts floating
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.760]   across twitter Facebook and other social networks and this is a real issue because these
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.280]   forms I mean sock puppets and bots can push trending topics high enough that they reinforce
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.960]   pre-existing or at least seated ideas with a mass population and then when that is constantly
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.400]   reinforced and we see potential conspiracies like what we're talking about here with
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:10.000]   intermingled with real outbreaks or real things of high stakes importance then the potential for
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.440]   disasters exceptionally high I'm old enough to remember though when the United States got together
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:22.480]   and eradicated polio that you know you used to be people were afraid to go to the movies
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.560]   because it was so easy to get polio there are still people today in iron lungs because they
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.080]   got polio in the 50s and they can't breathe on their own and people were really scared people
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:40.640]   were very very scared and when the sock vaccine came along there was a universal movement not just
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.600]   in the US but all over the world to get people vaccinated and polio was eradicated you know why
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.680]   though because back then you could trust certain institutions trust institutions yeah and now you
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.640]   can't right so this is kind of like the big threat is that even if the stuff comes out you know people
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.360]   are going to choose not to believe it and that's I think we're going to get challenging yeah so
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.400]   actually I take it all back I'm now in favor of VR conferences let's just move that knee and
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.520]   can I go back to the VR thing just for a minute I wanted to bring something up because I've changed
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.720]   my view on VR in a way that I think I talked about on the twit before and I now a VR optimist
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.640]   I'm sorry to go back to the positivity thing but like I was at a friend's house he's a huge nerd
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.240]   and they did an awesome VR setup and I forgot to play with it and it was mind-bindingly better
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.560]   than I thought so small note there but I thought that was just awesome and you don't have any
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.320]   extra earpup or anything it didn't make you nauseous nauseous no I'm blind as a bat and it was fine
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:40.960]   I played the Beat Saber thing that was beat same yeah yeah I was high I am still not high on VR
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   I'll be the last guy to go down on the next year yeah it could be the real key the whole
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.400]   length style yeah yeah that and like you know I'm really big fit on north like Canadian startup
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.360]   they do glasses that look like normal glasses the tiny projector you know they're almost I think
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.560]   way ahead of where they should be on this time kind of thing but that I think will be the
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.880]   breakthrough technology move back to the years away though decades away even I mean well north
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.400]   is already selling version one actually they stopped selling version one because version two
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.960]   is about to be announced and it's I mean this is a doable wearable technology today connects up
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.480]   to your android phone or iOS you wear a ring to control it as a little navigator they call these
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.920]   folkles yeah folkles yeah and it's actually pretty now what's cool too is it doesn't have to check
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:30.240]   out have you used them check out our review on hands on tat and he reviewed them yeah he liked
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.800]   them right did he like him to it dot tv slash h o t thank you 61 did he like him do you remember
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.360]   karst and I can't remember yeah he keeps wearing them he must have liked them it's still a it's
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:47.200]   still very much a a first draft but they're small I mean they look like spectacles you can have
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.280]   your prescription um so have you worn them uh Daniel did you if you try I haven't but uh
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.080]   Michael Fisher has and did a pretty extensive review of them and I like it that they look like
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.280]   regular glasses they have big temple pieces yeah and that's the version one version two is just
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:09.440]   be slimmer and lighter more comfortable so it's a heads up display on the glass of your glasses
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:16.000]   from the inside so it's a little projector so unlike uh uh the uh google glass you're not looking
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.120]   at a screen up above your eyebrow unlike hollow lens you're not you're not kind of looking through
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.400]   a male slide at the world with stuff projected on it it looks like it's it's able to put that
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:32.480]   just right up on the glass um yeah I I always thought this I agree with you I always thought and I
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.640]   call it AR but I guess mixed reality is probably more appropriate I always thought this was a
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.560]   much more compelling argument than beat saber in a yeah in a VR helmet well fine as I'll just
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:49.120]   just crap on my awesome VR I will say I will wear those focal things because I'm an enormous
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.680]   dork and they don't look that uncool and I would love to have a HUD in my digital you can put the
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.560]   stock market in your glasses like come on that's wouldn't that be awesome yes I want this I you
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.440]   know I really want as Daniel Suarez is reputation view where you look at people and there's a little
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.480]   bubble over and it says oh that's Mike you know he comes from highland california he's in the dairy
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:17.440]   business and he is 99.8 trustworthy that kind of thing would be really cool to have where I think
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:23.360]   biker software will use linkedin honestly oh maybe that's why they spent 30 000 billion dollars
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.720]   on linked what did what do they spend 20 billion on linkedin there was a huge amount of money
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.800]   yeah I can protect hard hard to hard to figure how they're going to make that money back unless
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:37.200]   that's all data man I mean that's a huge huge repository and it's one of the only few social
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.680]   networks you can go on and actually have serious discussions it's the only decent social network
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.240]   yeah yeah but yeah you combine that with some facial recognition and some augmented reality
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.400]   mixed reality glasses and you walk around out of conference if we still have conferences
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:57.040]   and you just ID people see their info but now we have now we have this tension between what's possible
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:03.680]   with big data and the combination data and and government and people very nervous about what's
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:10.320]   possible yep and wanting to regulate it wanting to cut back on it uh and I fear that you know what
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   you just talked about yeah they got all this face recognition data will they ever be allowed to use
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   it yeah so that's where you know this google came out what a couple weeks ago uh saying hey we finally
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:26.480]   support uh regulation of AI and no choice right yeah and Microsoft's been ahead of that game for
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.520]   like two years now Brad Smith has come out and he wrote a book about the whole topic and you know
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.960]   so that's that's a smart way like Microsoft at least was smart enough to go like this is a and
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.360]   it's a lot of opportunity here but if we do it wrong this is going to really screw up everything
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.600]   and so you know I think these companies being ahead of the game and going let's call for regulation
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.000]   but you really got Facebook on board with this right there are still the ones that are sticklers
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.800]   on all this privacy stuff whereas you know I'd say Microsoft even Google now is coming along
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   Apple of course as I would say there too they're pretty good with security privacy but you got
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.200]   to get like companies like Facebook who are just still that outlier who are just kind of driving
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:08.240]   thorn in everybody but you can't really do this stuff unless you're willing to combine databases
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:13.200]   from a variety of sources all the things privacy advocates are most afraid of or at least have
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.920]   an outside it really your way to do it safely could Apple do it and so see I think that's why
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.400]   Apple's AI and Siri are so far behind is they're not willing to do that yeah
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:29.520]   what Microsoft's proposing is an outside agency government agency that basically certifies
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.200]   what you're claiming on the security aspect of your AI or facial recognition and how it works
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:41.040]   this would have really been useful you know for this week for the Democratic caucus
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.640]   let's put more technology in Iowa right yeah I'm a I mean like I really love a lot of people in
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.880]   Microsoft and I think that they many of these people are very sincere when they talk about having
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.240]   third party or ombudsman type authorities Facebook has made similar noises as as Google Apple and
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.200]   the other major Facebook now has this government board right yeah right the problem is that many
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:09.920]   of these things appear very nice prima foshes superficially but when you dig below the surface they seem
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.480]   fairly cynical or designed to get ahead of regulation or bend regulation in ways that don't threaten
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.680]   the business models but do allow them to say we are doing x y and z for the public interest
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.120]   that is not a statement intended to denigrate the people at salesforce Microsoft and other places
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:34.160]   calling for these third party boards I just want to see them as the 3d chess that they are and that
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.120]   the motivations might not be as altruistic as they'd like us to believe true no that's definitely true
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.280]   yeah because otherwise they don't want you know to have you know government hearings and congress
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.080]   and laws being passed where they're not they don't control the message right at least this way
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.840]   with Microsoft and you know google now they're getting ahead they can kind of control the message
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:56.800]   a bit and you're right you know they can control the regulation which would favor them you know so
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   it's important let's take a little break we've got a great panel I think we could talk about
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:06.160]   anything here and it would be informative and fun Alex Wilhelm from tech now at tech crunch back
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:12.320]   at tech crunch great to have you I'm gonna have to take a still of your background and look at all
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:18.160]   the books you're reading my goodness this is this is my wife and my library it goes a little bit
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.960]   further but so they're not all mine that's Fowler's English English over your right shoulder
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:31.200]   two volume sets looks like someone to stop pointing no left left no right right right if you're not
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   watching the video I'm sorry

[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.200]   during the Iowa clock as the source of mine sent me the source code and some video from the shadow
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:27.760]   app no other sources of mine at the DNC well formally the DNC at now third party organization
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.680]   started to leak a bunch about acronym the company that funded them right they said pretty vitriolic
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:40.880]   things these are these are people who are tech insiders at the the formally the democrat partisans
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.000]   and the app itself we took it apart and we had experts look at it as well and there was some
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:53.040]   I mean it was fine it just looked like your code academy project right oh well yeah you know they
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:00.640]   paid of whopping fifty thousand dollars for it I'm amazed it ran at all we spent we spent 75
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.360]   thousand dollars with it with a company in India that was going to make a twitter app never got
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.680]   anything useful out of it at all we were so embarrassed by it we didn't even tell anybody about it we
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.880]   just ate the money and went on I don't know what you get for 60th I guess they they they
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.760]   Iowa also put in 60 so maybe they I mean not Nevada so maybe they got something I don't know
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.120]   it doesn't sound good but they got was an embarrassment yeah real on that's an embarrassment all around
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.800]   yeah I mean I want to hear more we'll talk more about that with you Dan because I want to hear
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.080]   your your the background on that this is this is good this is why you you're going to go to CBSN

[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:24.640]   uses what is that yeah that's a sort of a pride right yeah we are brought to you this week by a
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:31.040]   fresh books I have to say I have a real soft spot in my heart for fresh books I started using it
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.680]   way back when I said come up to Canada and and do the call for help up there in Canada and
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   I'd have to invoice them in Canadian dollars and I have to send them expenses oh Canada and and
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:46.400]   it was just a pain but Amber MacArthur told me she said there's a startup in Toronto you're
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:52.720]   gonna love it's called fresh books it helped me do my invoices beautiful invoices it started as
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.680]   invoicing software but I have to say really it's accounting software without you doing any accounting
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.480]   that's the beauty part of it use fresh books to create beautiful professional invoices you can
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.720]   as soon as you start using fresh books your clients could start paying you online they can
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:13.120]   actually pay you from within the invoice that's amazing based on that by the way you'll get paid
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:20.000]   like twice as fast that was my experience and then because you've got fresh books in the invoices
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.320]   you also that's accounts receivable you also have the accounts paid you also have your expenses
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.560]   because I was putting it using the fresh books app to take pictures that receipts put them
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.520]   right up into the invoice keep track of it it'll even dial into your bank and download expenses so
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:40.240]   essentially you're if this is the genuinely easy to use invoice expensive and managing your books
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:47.200]   program if you're a small business owner or freelancer as I was you're gonna love fresh books 24 million
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.840]   people have used it now four and a half out of five stars on get app small business owners
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:57.520]   love fresh books I loved fresh books it lets you focus on the reason you got into business not on
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.880]   invoicing not on accounting and man when tax time comes you will love it that you can get all the
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:08.240]   reports you need it automatically combines expenses billable time yes you can do hours on
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.320]   that they have a you could put a timer in there you can have different prices for different projects
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.560]   even if it's the same client you got client profiles you've got automation for recurring invoices no
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:24.720]   matter what you do fresh books can can transform the way you run your business and I for me this
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:30.480]   was always the hard part was the the bookkeeping the accounting the reporting the tax time stuff
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.800]   there was the stuff I wasn't any good at fresh books really saved me stop you can also stop
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:39.680]   chasing after the money your clients owe you I mean it starts with being able to take online
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   payments whether it's credit cards and ach ach ach transfers that's in the u.s. only get you paid
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.680]   twice as fast you'll also get notifications the minute your client opens it invoice so no more
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:55.120]   saying I get the invoice they'll automatically send late payment reminders they'll bill late fees
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.560]   they just make it easy fresh books it's easy with great toronto based support

[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:48.400]   uh moving right along we were talking about coronavirus apple is reopening its stores but it's kind of a
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:56.240]   soft reopening temperature checks as people come in the door limited hours crowd control and
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.440]   they're only you know half the hours they're normally open it just doesn't sound like a very
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:07.520]   welcoming prospect no and apple stores have one of the highest like sales per square foot of
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.840]   stores in the world and so if they're limiting hours limiting people I mean this is real material
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.080]   revenue has been lost cost them a lot of money uh is do you have any no uh word about what the
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:23.440]   this will slow down they were we expected going to announce next month probably new iPhones and
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:30.560]   iPads I don't see how they can do that now wow I mean I don't know that's more of a verbino
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:35.600]   question I feel but my answer is I hope so because my iPhone 7 is finally dying and I have to actually
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.840]   get a replacement eventually so I feel like I need I need to get excited about something but
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.000]   daniel what do you got yeah I haven't really heard too much about new iPhones I won't be surprised
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.360]   though if they do some iPad refreshes uh the iPhone I expect maybe in the fall and then there's
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.760]   gonna be that question of are they gonna finally do 5g um and there's been talks of a significant
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.840]   revision I'm gonna say as someone who's actually been if he had an apple for the last few years the
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.760]   iPhone 11's actually been a super impressive device that we use I did up until this week which
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:09.040]   we can talk about this oh what are you using now oh man how did you get one of them I'm so jealous
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:15.280]   I ordered one that's amazing so I ordered one from Best Buy 2 that's the Z Flip so Samsung had
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:22.800]   its big unpacked event uh on Tuesday they announced four new phones three new s20s that's the designation
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:31.520]   for the Samsung Galaxy s phones for this year the s20s 20 plus s20 ultra like 120 megahertz refresh
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:38.240]   or Hertz not megahertz 120 Hertz fresh um 18 cameras or something the giant camera bump I
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:43.840]   mean it's just crazy but all of this looked like kind of well that's what I'd expect the next generation
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:50.080]   Galaxy s then they announced the Z Flip or as the rest of the world calls it the Z Flip
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:57.440]   that to me is the most interesting phone of the year it really is so let me see it you got it
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.840]   you ordered it at Best Buy did you go did you get it Friday or yes I I was one of those uh
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:09.280]   Thursday night at midnight yes you know I ordered it within like five minutes me too and then they're
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.960]   like yeah they're like you'll get it one day and it actually showed up Saturday so I should
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.200]   have very good Best Buy experience not that I'm not sure by them but I was going to go pick it up
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:22.960]   at uh my problem maybe as I said I'll get it at the Santa Rosa store and you live in New York I
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:29.200]   think well I'm in Massachusetts now oh you're Massachusetts okay um I I think what they said was
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:37.040]   uh San Francisco LA New York New York the big city Atlanta had a few I would have like five
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:42.880]   yeah you're right yeah so they're really sold out everywhere but that's because they sold a hundred
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:48.400]   right at twenty four so this is where I was still limited I told you I'd go into San Francisco
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:54.640]   and stand in line so far I mean I'm gonna go look at my order I give it I made a bookmark this is
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.080]   how much I care I made a bookmark on my on my web browser to check my Best Buy order
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.800]   so what do you think Daniel?
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:09.360]   Yeah so it's a it is the most intriguing piece of technology I've used since by Joe
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:16.000]   Metesal um it is it's really got me to rethink technology in terms of phones and it's not all
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.120]   perfect right like if you opening it closing it is definitely an extra step and if you're always
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.040]   putting your phone out of your pocket there's that trade-off and that's real it's also a little bit
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.120]   more delicate or at least I'm treating it more delicate than I probably would you know something
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:34.480]   like the S20 Ultra um that said the way like I have it right now with it sort of you know propped
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:40.560]   open like this as a little little barbie laptop yeah I think that's great I live at my desk like
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.920]   this and it has the always on display so it just shows my calendar any notifications and now I'm
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:52.080]   using it also with Microsoft's um your phone because it's built into Samsung's phone so it's Windows 10
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.040]   I just launched your phone app I can now mirror the phone I can actually just run the apps directly
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.160]   again notifications I can make phone calls I can do text messages all while it's open on my computer
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.200]   and that's like it uses Wi-Fi direct basically and it's actually a very fast connection so it's
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:12.320]   really just sort of made me rethink about what a um a smartphone can be I don't think it's for
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.600]   everybody it's still too early you know this question like is it worth it you know come on it's
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:22.080]   $1400 most people it's not going to be worth it but um it really is transformative I hate to be
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:28.080]   cliche but it really does sort of make you rethink uh you know what phones and devices can be and
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:34.320]   this idea that it's a large phone that folds up and you know I close it here and I just go oh
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:41.440]   ah pick it up pick it up pick it up is it okay oh little phone are you okay little phone
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:48.320]   no I have a rod gets all right oh my god and you got the right color you got the purple so yeah you
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   see a crease you see a little subtle crease where it bends yeah so when you if you open it and you
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.040]   go into the light and you kind of reflect it you have to do that though yeah but when you're using it
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.720]   you absolutely do not see the crease you feel the crease and that's weird um it feels like it
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.520]   felt at first to me like I had a uh some gunk on the screen or something but you get used to it
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.960]   and instead it's halfway up you can actually scroll mostly in the bottom half this green oh I
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.640]   see I can see the crease when you hold it like that I could totally yeah yeah yeah there we go
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:23.360]   yeah yeah no no you expel look it's folding so I think that there's two ways to go with a
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:28.800]   folding phone either unfold it to make it bigger or or start small and make it normal phone size and
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.400]   I think this is unfortunately the Moto racer was announced two weeks ago and apparently isn't very
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:40.800]   good it's crinkly and weird uh Samsung comes along two weeks later says well how about this they claim
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:49.360]   to be using very thin foldy glass yeah although Jerry rig have you seen Jerry rig yet because Jerry
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.880]   rig everything it kind of makes me mad because Jerry likes takes you know exacto knives and
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:01.280]   and pointy objects and tries to scrape the darn thing oh that's just like a torture I know it's
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:07.520]   a saw for gadgets I don't like that I can't even get one and Jerry's already oh oh no take it off
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:13.680]   oh it's where we take the exacto knife to the metal on the side and start scraping it so obviously
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:19.680]   no one is going to do that but he is measuring the mow hardness and he says yeah it's a hardness of
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:25.520]   only two or three it is not glass hard so what do you think yeah his theory is it's not really
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:32.160]   glass it's a polymer with glass part of some better it's glass like yeah yeah we don't who knows
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.920]   right I mean they're being coy on this let's just be honest and like Samsung probably could have been
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:41.840]   it a lot of this is marketing so the the issue is this when you use it and you feel it and compare
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:46.960]   it to the fold and the razor phone it feels way better that's why you're by so excited about it
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:53.040]   does feel smooth it feels glass like and that's why people are like kind of believing it you know
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:58.000]   but when it comes to it doesn't have the properties of glass in terms of resilience and that's sort
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.840]   of the issue now to Samsung's credit here they're like you can get a professionally installed screen
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:10.160]   protector on it which they offer that at no charge yeah you go to fix I can you fix it you fix it
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:19.680]   whatever it's called I have you fix what is it called yeah I do know no no it's it's a it's a phone
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:25.920]   repair company I fix you break you break I fix something like that yeah yeah and then um the other
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:31.760]   thing is if yeah if you break the display they'll replace it for a one time for $120 which is which
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.920]   is yeah I mean that's expensive but for $1400 I'll phone that's like okay that's actually a pretty
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.200]   good thing so I think we have to learn that if it's a foldable screen you don't take an
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.320]   exacto knife to it you know treat it with some here he is though I may have to say he's using his
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:52.800]   fingernail yeah that's what I mean he's creasing it with his fingernail yep oh don't do that don't
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:58.720]   do that folks just be very gentle with it I do like the form factor I think this is and it bodes
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:04.800]   well for Microsoft because they've got now they're doing two screens with a hinge the neo in this
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:10.480]   glass yeah yeah but I think that's where the benefit is yeah you know I think there's a good form I love
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.880]   the little smurf laptop form factor I think yeah is Apple is doing anything like this is there
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.480]   Apple device that has a cool screen like this or are they gonna fall behind in form factors and
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.080]   eventually get themselves in the back of the market here they're going to do what they always
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:29.840]   do which is they're going to them and their fans will continue to dismiss this as a gimmick a
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:35.040]   fan it's breakable stupid everybody comes out does it and to Apple's credit you'll probably come
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.720]   out and do it right as all Apple fans like to say and I honestly don't doubt that's how the company
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.360]   operates but they'll probably come out with a you know by that time that the actual material
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:50.800]   science we're expecting corning to actually have bendable foldable glass by the end of this year
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:56.560]   you know Apple will do I think everybody's going to do this or at least offer a version of it because
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.800]   what you keep hearing people talk about is you know it's what Leo was saying so this is a large
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:05.360]   phone that folds into a smaller one the galaxy fold is a tablet that folds into the size of a
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.880]   phone and you know I like this better yeah women yeah put in your purse I could put it you know
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.200]   it's like a pocket square you could put it yeah it's really it's really small and why I mean even
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.320]   at the gym you know it's nice not having a slab of my pant leg you know like you don't feel it as
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:27.280]   much it's heavy but it's uh stop it Alex you have a dirty mind he made a general I laughed at
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:34.720]   his fault you know Daniel words he said flab in his pant like yeah well now now who's double clicking
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:41.680]   on my on my giggles you know it's you sir no I agree I like the idea of a smaller phone that gives
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:46.160]   you all the affordances of a larger phone and then some I mean I think Google knew that folding
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:52.880]   phones were coming they adapted Android for photables so that a program like Google Duo can know that
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.920]   it's half open and put the picture on the top the controls on the bottom I think there's I hope
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:05.200]   we see more apps do that I think that's a real all the Samsung apps must be fold aware right yeah
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.560]   YouTube does it right now Duo and there's a couple other apps it's not a ton but Samsung did say
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.880]   they're going to release and the API and work with Google and partners to sort of bring that feature
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:19.520]   but yeah that's what makes it it's that feature really kind of makes it one of the more interesting
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.120]   devices but in terms of the experience of it the cameras are very good the battery life has been
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.600]   solid so far it's not amazing battery life but if for most people in this demographic I would say
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:36.000]   it's fine it's an 855 snap dragon so it's so as fast as any of this year last year's flagships
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.240]   not as fast as the s20 will be but it's fine yeah I mean this is basically
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:48.000]   two that late 2019 flagship phone in terms of specs the cameras are great it's wireless charging
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.880]   8 gigs of RAM comes with a little case in the box I mean it's a cool device it's not perfect
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.840]   you know it's for early adopters trendsetters and that's the point of it to get it out there
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.320]   I've seen so many influencers and people in tech haven't this weekend that's exactly kind of what
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.960]   Samsung wanted right we're all talking about it but if you go read most of the everybody's doing sort
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.440]   of 24 hour 48 hour reviews and updates everybody's pretty you know happy about it actually I was
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:20.480]   wait though if you're I mean I'm gonna buy it but right away as you did but I would wait a month or
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:25.520]   so before you a normal person spends 1400 bucks on this because you really do want to make sure it's
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.080]   going to be durable we've had a bad experience already with the galaxy fold you know the galaxy
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.880]   fold to its credit with that second version that came out I know quite a few people who have it
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:41.120]   and it's funny because you're not hearing fold displays getting scratch breaking all that like
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.080]   it there there's not that's not out there right now so they seem to have done a pretty solid job
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:53.040]   with this but it's still too expensive for most people Samsung has rewritten the bad branding that
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:59.280]   the fold had last year I mean initially and Daniel to your point and the use of the word gimmick that's
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:05.920]   all I thought about foldable phones right 12 months ago and what they've done is not just say hey this
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:11.680]   isn't a gimmick they put it into a product that you can use right now and get the same use that you
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:19.760]   would out of a traditional smartphone but in a non gimmicky form factor I think maybe it's
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.480]   the chatroom saying oh you tech people you just want something new to talk about and that's fair
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.480]   we have slab glass slab phones we've had to put up with them since for the last 10 years
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.080]   it's nice to see something a different form factor and for the first time I think this is a
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:41.120]   form factor that might have some legs we it's not the first folding phone I had a motor razor way back
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.920]   in the day right this one doesn't give you the satisfying hang up though right Daniel you can't
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:52.480]   slap you can you can do yeah yeah does that yep damn you I mean it's what's really fun about this
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:57.200]   is so I got a work phone when I went back to TechCrunch because it's part of the Verizon world and so I
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:01.600]   got a Verizon work run so I have a newer iPhone with my old personal iPhone and I was shocked
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.360]   at how within five minutes I was bored a bit there was nothing there that got me excited there's
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:10.160]   no new experiences no new apps it was it was a little bit smaller a little bit faster I had face
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.240]   ID it's incremental you'll feel the same way when you go to the set from the seven to the 11 it's
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:21.120]   an incremental upgrade it's not you know whoo but a second screen apps that work with my computer
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.560]   you know always on displays these are things that are actually different they could change my
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:29.520]   workflow and that's exciting to me I was very excited about the duo and the neo Microsoft's end
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:34.560]   of year products I think there's one Android one windows I think they're going to be very
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:41.200]   interesting Microsoft this week at the developer conference allowed people to start playing with
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:49.120]   what is this new version of windows called Windows 10 X X yeah what's what's different Daniel what
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:54.240]   is 10 X so 10 X is a really interesting thing we've been covering it for the last almost like I
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:58.560]   think three years it's based off of the thing called Windows Core OS so the core of this is still
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:04.480]   Windows it's also Azure this is why the core of Windows is under the Azure group now but the shell
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.840]   is unique and different and new it's sort of an amalgamation between Windows desktop and Windows
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:14.560]   mobile although Microsoft won't say that because you know Windows mobile has a pretty bad reputation
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:20.720]   at this point but what it is it's a it kind of looks like Windows 10 desktop as you know it but
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:27.440]   it had they removed all the win 32 legacy components from it that is all the stuff that's built on
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:33.360]   classic windows that runs on your desktop is both its strength and its weakness it's been around
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   some of those components in Windows 10 that you're using right now on your desktop is 20 years old
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:42.320]   you know it's a fax machine and stuff so what they did was all that stuff is gone it's just core
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.920]   Windows and then this new shell experience on top that's built around dual experience devices
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   although later on we definitely expect as it does run on single screen so we know
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.720]   there are long term plans it's to get to the initially it's for the duo or the neo rather it's
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.520]   a right initially planned for a two screen device but you know what Microsoft has needed to kind of
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:06.560]   get the cruft out for a long time and I think really one of the reasons the neo exists is not
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.200]   because Microsoft thinks that a future of all computers is dual screen but because they wanted
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:15.440]   something so different knew that they could create you know kind of okay but we're gonna make it
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.960]   for a new windows for that yeah that is because one of the problems Microsoft has is all the people
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:25.440]   running old PCs that need to run their line of business software on old versions of windows
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:32.240]   legacy has been a handcuffing Microsoft for decades so having a new device and they could say well
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:38.560]   understand we're gonna leave legacy out here we're gonna create something unique they've also
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:45.040]   they're also containerizing win 32 win 32 and then in other words they're separating it away from
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.720]   so if there are problems or security issues or crash issues it's kind of in its own little
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:53.760]   container away from the rest of the operating system is that right yeah they're getting the
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.240]   best of both worlds here so you're going to get this new UI this new experience it's it's literally
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.720]   I mean it was rumored to be called windows light and that's because that's so you can think of it
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:06.800]   that way it's it's physically a lighter operating system but that's a bad name because it implies
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:11.120]   is it's gonna be kind of like functionality yeah so that's why it's called windows 10 so it'll run
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:18.480]   64-bit apps yes will they run in container as well yes everything everything uh you know in the
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.360]   run's native is uwp the universal windows platform those run native still containerized but
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:31.200]   that's how uwp runs anyway win 32 including x86 32 bit in 64 bit apps run as a single container
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.680]   it's an abstracted weight it's a subsystem of the operating system which means when you're not
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:42.000]   using it it doesn't use any resources which is the benefit here so they get a tight security
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.040]   model for the operating system it's not slowed down by having legacy win 32 components running
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:52.160]   in the background like system tray but when you need to run yet that app you just launch it and
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:59.840]   it just will show up and it be it actually is launching a version of windows 10 the actual windows 10
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:06.560]   operating system but without all the the unnecessary fluff and ui and it runs the app and the app
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:11.120]   does everything you expect it to if you open up a file you want to save a file those directories
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:16.960]   directories will exist and so it it you get everything so if you want to run those apps you can do it
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:22.320]   and then if you minimize that win 32 app it's going to basically suspend in the background so again
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:27.040]   what this is prioritizing is performance battery life and things for that's important to mobile
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:31.440]   and this is what's always been hampering mobile devices with microsoft is when you run win 32
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:38.480]   stuff it's bad for battery uwp is very good for battery but it's it's not the app solution for
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:44.240]   everybody so nice you want to run that photoshop app right so this kind of solves all those problems
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.600]   and the emulator release this week is an opportunity for developers to actually try it out and see
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:57.360]   what runs and what doesn't it's interesting um for so many reasons it's interesting the apps will
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:02.960]   run full screen but i think that's intended for the neo if you were running on a big screen desktop
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:09.040]   it might not but uh but the apps run full screen kind of like dablitt mode yeah that's a it was
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.240]   funny because when i i interviewed some people at microsoft about this and i asked them about that
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:19.520]   topic and there's a lot of internal debate even within mocks have about is that the right approach
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:24.320]   the theory is if you're on a small screen device and the neo is basically two nine inch device
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:28.960]   two nine inch screens that span out to about 13 inches when you're on a device like that
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.760]   having multi windows like five windows on a single pane is probably not something most people
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.920]   are going to do they're going to operate it with you know full screen but yeah if you go to a
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:42.320]   larger screen device you'd want that freedom but they're not locked into either one that's one
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.840]   reason why they're giving it to developers and if they hear developers go listen even on small
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:50.560]   devices we want to have multiple windows and windowed uh you know side by side kind of things
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:55.920]   they're open to allowing that to happen you know i wonder what you guys think i have kind of come
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:03.600]   around to the full screen app even on my mac now i will full screen everything and swip between
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:09.040]   separate desktops i think this idea of having a lot of little windows doing different things
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.600]   is not really how the mind works we are never good we don't multitask we time we
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.800]   time slice and so it makes more sense to have one task full screen in front of you and then
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.360]   swipe it out of the way to do another thing there's occasionally you want side by side and that's
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:31.200]   what a tools dual screen device is a very interesting device because you can have controls on one side
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:37.040]   and the objects you're operating on on the other side or something like that um i'm more and more
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.520]   convinced that full screen isn't a bad way it is a very good way to operate i don't maybe it's
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.680]   just me yeah i i agree with that but once again i'm on twit and we're talking about a couple
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.360]   different companies a couple different platforms couple different devices and we're talking about
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.880]   apple being a bit boring and everyone else being kind of cool and it's just such a hilarious
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.040]   inversion from where we work four years ago five years ago yeah i'm blown away like i mean
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:02.720]   that's called success Alex true but i just listened to daniel talking about developer things for
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.880]   like five minutes and i was actually interested in it like that's how cool this is like like it's
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.840]   it's evidence that what's being built is in fact different and exciting and maybe opening up new
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.400]   doors for us to do cool things uh and whereas my new iphone 11 that i got from work is just the
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.200]   i fell asleep oh taking out of the box so it's fun i'm excited about the future we do have to um
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:29.600]   remember that the human brain is tuned to change we we we're you know if there's a tiger
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.320]   stalking us we don't want to see the landscape unchanging landscape we want to see what's different
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:40.800]   it's the tiger and our brain really embraces change and newness and prefers it to the same old same
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.680]   old that's kind of a classic human problem and it's a big problem for tech reporters because we're
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.000]   always going what's the next new thing what's the next new thing instead of saying hey this thing
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.400]   is perfect this is doing exactly what it should do so i i just want to say i'm going to try to
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:01.040]   not be too enamored of the new just for news in this sake but it does seem to me the windows needed
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.400]   this refresh and now i asked we spend a lot of time on windows weekly talking about
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.160]   virtual machines versus containers and i'm sure daniel you're up on this so correct me if i'm wrong
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.760]   but a virtual machine is heavyweight because it contains the entire operating system it's basically
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:24.320]   everything running in in a separate little window whereas a container the operating system is a
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.280]   there's a single core operating system that all the containers share but the containers still are
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.560]   somewhat isolated so you get some of the benefits of virtualization without the heavyweight
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.440]   extra you know multiple operating systems yeah so you'll be able to like i said run the 32
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:45.360]   bit and 64 bit classic apps and they behave they're supposed to behave as expected the difference
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.400]   is like for instance if you have an app that runs at startup and then it goes and pops at a system
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.640]   tray that doesn't work on windows 10x because because there's no system tray anymore because
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.320]   that's a legacy 132 thing so what happened but what happens is though they built it so when it
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.520]   does those api and registry calls the os basically hears them but sort of ignores them in other
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.960]   words the app shouldn't crash or shouldn't be unusable because of that you'll still be able to run the app
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.800]   and just mean some of these classic apps so there's no back rounding there's no
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:21.120]   not right now but even there they're flexible on so right now when 32 apps on windows 10x if you
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.840]   minimize them or you close it of course it's going to spend all those processes and
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.320]   gives all the resources back to the operating system if you bring that window back up for
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.000]   when 32 the system resources will focus on that because that's what you're using so that's where
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.200]   you get the smart stuff but they are open to the idea of giving basically users a switch a toggle
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.840]   that would allow this knowing the fact that you're going to take a hit now on performance and battery
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.400]   life but again they're open to that idea but i think for the you know consumer experience they
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   prefer not to happen and there is a question what classic app do you need to be running on
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.960]   something like the surface neo that needs to be running in the background as your mobile right
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:05.280]   so that's where this isn't like a desktop operating system that's where sort of the how hard it is
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.880]   going to be for developers to get their head around is this a hard thing a new way a new paradigm or is
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:17.200]   it that's what's cool about it is right now the default experience on 10x is if you launch an app
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.640]   it just takes up a single one of the screens and then if you want you can drag it over into the
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.360]   middle and then it'll go to both screens and span and you'll you'll get that so it is technically
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.960]   not a lot like even if you have a classic app companies don't need to go redo anything for
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.080]   their app what mike shop's done with this emulator and the sdk for is basically said if you want to
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.560]   leverage the dual screen stuff and they fully admit not all apps are going to be able to benefit
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.080]   from this right doesn't make sense but if you have something like outlook where you can have
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.080]   you know the email lists on one side and then on the other side you have the email and you can
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.040]   use those independently or if you're on the Skype call you open up one note and you can follow a
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.600]   presentation or a PowerPoint you know this is where it starts to make sense where you can have apps
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:05.360]   span across and do these dual things so that's what's neat about it is you don't need to developers
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:10.400]   don't have to actually do anything a lot of times to just have the app run it will buy default and
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:17.040]   this goes for the duo too for android but they want developers to sort of think about how they
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.600]   could utilize this opportunity here if they so choose to as an experience on this device
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:27.440]   and how about users is this going to be you know intuitive for users are they going to say oh yeah
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.280]   I get what's going I think if you have a two screen device it will be in fact I think users
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.880]   are going to like it yeah when you look at the and Zach Bowden our senior writer did a walk through
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.760]   video it's 20 minutes because you can see the whole yeah you can see it all in action it's a very
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:48.960]   it's it's like if you combines ipad OS with the power of windows and what's neat about it is it's
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.840]   not a it's not a windows version of ipad OS because you still get to run all your legacy
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.720]   applications but you really need to think about it this way windows 10 desktop is win 32 first
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:07.040]   and uwp second right you can run uwp apps on there if you want to you are those store apps
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.080]   basically the store apps right this is reverse this is windows 10x is uwp first
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.440]   but windows 32 still runs on there and you still get near native performance as well so you get
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:23.600]   legacy but you get legacy kind of in a protected mode so that it can't screw you up win 32 has
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.040]   historically been the biggest problem on win it actually solves the virus problem in in theory
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.720]   don't need to even run antivirus on this because of the way it's containerized
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:38.800]   the win 32 if you installed an executable that was a virus cannot infect the operating system
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:44.560]   because it's siloed off so because of that again returns to performance of the operating system
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.400]   better for mobile so it's a it's a really kind of neat idea it's they've been working on this
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.760]   for a very long time it's required ridiculous amounts of engineering but it's a modular operating
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:58.720]   system so they could actually you know some of this part of this runs on hollow lens too
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.120]   they could take out the win 32 subsystem and make a phone if they want to you know it's your
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.960]   original plan for surface duo but they switched it to android because the app problem still exists
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.120]   what if they actually built the phone into this and just didn't call it windows phone
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.560]   decision to avoid the whole microsoft phone you know historical if you ask this
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.120]   phone they said don't call it a phone but it's running android and you can make calls with it
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.480]   that's a phone well pano's field phone he never said it's not a phone he just said it's a phone
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.400]   but more than that okay and so he's just making that that's just a marketing thing they're just
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.680]   making a distinction to separate themselves from the market well they don't have a phone that's
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.040]   such a bad reputation they never want to make a service phone again yeah they could have and
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.120]   that's what they do what was going to be it's gonna be windows 10x is gonna be a phone but they knew
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.360]   they want it to succeed right they want people to buy this and the app problem no matter how
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.240]   much die hard windows fans want that thing it would not succeed because you still need
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.120]   snapchat you need gmail you need like all these core apps and without that it wouldn't succeed but
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:03.440]   they they could you know like five years from now this app story changes whether it's pwa's or uwp
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.720]   takes off you know which probably won't happen but could they could easily put telephony into the
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.760]   system and just make a phone they could do that they want to it's easy i will buy that i will buy
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:19.840]   that because i want i want there to be another member of the the mobile OS world i'm so bored
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.720]   yeah with with what we have i know we need the competition frankly right that'll spur it forward
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.560]   but i mean leo your point about not just going after the new thing because it's new it is totally
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.680]   valid and technology should work better than it does and a lot of new stuff doesn't work that
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:37.200]   well including software but after 10 years of this kind of one form factor for mobile phones i
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.200]   i'm stoked beyond believe that we're finally going to break out of this box and do some new
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:46.560]   things if it's the flip phone if it's dual screen machines if it's a weird hybrid ls that brings i
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:52.000]   you know ipad iOS equivalents and windows together whatever it is i'm ready to have new stuff because
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.320]   i'm drowning i have so much going on you're basically like peggy lee
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:04.000]   uh is none of us kept that yeah she said all there is is that all there is
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   is that all there is two phones i was just not know who peggy lee is i know i know who peggy lee i
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.960]   just do that to him to make him feel young i mean i'm getting old but i still don't know your
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:20.000]   references i don't know what to do i don't know Daniel is there any purpose or would there be any
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.040]   purpose to boot camp this even just or is it possible to boot camp this even you want to put
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.960]   on your mac huh i yeah i i mean as he's talking as daniel is explaining this i'm like how can i
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.880]   extract myself from macOS and iOS and fully move over to windows i mean this sounds like what
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.520]   alix is talking about real innovation not innovation is a gimmick but gimmick uh
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:46.000]   innovation that will push productivity in the consumer experience even more than that
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.080]   microsoft's been pushed into this because windows is such a nightmare windows 10 especially is a
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:58.480]   nightmare they just put out an update that breaks people's windows and people are rolling back
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.640]   because they can't trust the updates microsoft it's not it's innovation because we need to innovate
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.560]   but also because we're desperate because we have a problem here this is leg is this cold
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:15.360]   that code is sold and so messed up and so spaghettied they gotta clean it up please people though do
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:21.200]   not uh try to roll back to windows 7 because that's broken don't do that well it's all really
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.840]   that mean that's the funny thing is still windows 7 that's the problem that's this card base this
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.680]   old code base they're just tacking stuff onto that's why 10x is more is more interesting i they
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:37.440]   didn't start from the ground up though either uh well 10x is from the ground up it is i mean
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.400]   the entire shell is completely new so everything about it is built like it's going to be a very
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.960]   consistent ui in terms of the operating system if you're running one third two apps that's you're
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:52.560]   going to get a contrast to to get back to Dan's question um as a right now so there are people who
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:59.040]   are actually booting this onto a macbook here it is this is the tweet this is from a sunshine biscuit
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:06.480]   at scale yeah so you know it's it's good so the problem it's very risky you you're injecting
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.280]   drivers it's not something you can like roll back and you know it you don't probably want to do this
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.920]   right now but there there are some people putting guides out there it does work uh someone's also
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:22.160]   done on surface go in a del x ps 13 and it goes to show you that this is fully operational as a
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:27.440]   standard laptop operating system because that's what makshaus long-term plan is but in what leo is
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:32.080]   saying they're doing this on dual screens to basically raise interest and hype and interest and also
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:38.000]   so it doesn't scare off those scare people that's the key yeah so but long term yeah this is you know
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.520]   i've met you don't want to see mikersif does want to see announcement there's a new operating system
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.000]   from mikersif that's the worst thing i don't want to they don't want to scare people that way yeah
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.160]   because in it departments can be like wait what do i know i got no about this so it's like new device
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.920]   experiences is how they're going to do it right that said obviously this is an emulator people
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:01.760]   putting onto max there's no iso yet uh we don't know makshaus plans is i can tell you there's no
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:08.240]   plan in place for people to upgrade windows 10 desktop to windows 10x it's probably not going
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:14.160]   to be able to be done because it's a completely different system but as we get further along you
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.880]   know who knows how the story may change and yeah maybe we'll see a boot camp version of this happen
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:27.600]   but you know make no mistake this is the version of windows that makersof sees most people going to
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.160]   the next i would say five to ten years this is the real future forward-looking version of windows
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:37.440]   desktop the classic windows will always exist it'll be there for people who need it
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:43.360]   but increasingly um you know what this allows them to do is create new hardware that they couldn't
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:48.480]   do before including dual-screen devices and things that use small processors that aren't always
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:54.000]   Intel-based this one is Intel-based for now but we've seen it with ARM and AMD so allows them to
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.240]   create new experiences where they were hampered before with classic windows that's really the
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.760]   purpose here you really wonder uh i got my apple has to have some sort of skunk works
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.520]   where they're saying well what's what's next i mean we've we've labored really there are only
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:15.120]   three operating systems for desktops and we've just kind of nothing's changed over the decade
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.040]   google has been working on fuchsia we've talked about that before and i think
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:25.440]   somewhat of a defensive maneuver because android is under assault from oracle and you know that's
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.080]   gonna go to the supreme court um they did file a trademark for a new operating system
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:40.080]   i don't know how serious they are the name is pigweed i didn't get to see this i i missed this
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.680]   apparently what what is pigweed Leo well it is a metaphor i don't know it's a
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:52.080]   google's filed a trademark application for the name pigweed the application says it will cover
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:58.560]   computer operating software that's the only detail i don't know if they're going to change the
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:07.600]   name from fuchsia to pigweed pigweed is botanical uh it's a plant uh pigweed according to the
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:13.280]   brooklyn botanical garden just around the road piece from you there dan uh our otherwise knows
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:19.680]   is amaranth you know amaranth it's a leafy plant that is edible nutritious and some pigweeds when
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.480]   fully grown will dry out and form tumbleweeds so i think we now know what google's up to not
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:29.760]   smokeable though do not smoke the pigweed yes although amaranth is also the name of a uh
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.680]   european symphonic metal band so if you want a little nice you just go tie in there uh huh i
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:43.120]   rest my case yes pigweed if it's not an ought of e all right let's take let's take a little break
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.800]   this is good you guys are so good i just you just keep this show going for hours and hours and hours
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:57.280]   you don't need to eat do you um i passed so danielle bino he's intermittent fasting as we speak
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.040]   executive editor windows central it's great to have you on uh daniel dan patterson from uh cnet
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.960]   cbs interactive and cbs news always a pleasure senior producer over there covering and it's turned
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:16.000]   dark in brooklyn the lights are out uh sun sun has gone down and uh from my childhood home
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.920]   in beautiful providence redialy not merely the city but the actual house
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:30.080]   alex will helm reporter at tech crunch it's a long long story but he is living in the home that i
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:36.240]   grew up in in providence he's actually my son we can we can tell it's true it's a long wedding
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:42.080]   secret and gag on the show and as well just everybody knows now what is there to hide our
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.480]   show we're going to st louis next month i'm excited about this we're going to do an event for worldwide
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:54.160]   technology you know if you're an enterprise you know wwt uh and do you know the atc worldwide
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.560]   technology is advanced technology center that is pretty amazing they started building it 10 years
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.920]   ago i think you know there used to be we used to have in foster cities if davis labs amazing
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.400]   testing facility and now that the there's no longer as if davis labs i'm thrilled that wwt has taken
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:19.280]   the mantle and built their advanced technology center more than half a billion dollars in enterprise
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:26.320]   equipment there from hundreds of oem's key partners ranging from heavyweights like del emc and vm
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:33.520]   where an intel emerging disruptors to like equinox why do they build this well wwt's engineers use
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:39.040]   these environments to spin up proofs of concept and pilots that use the lab environment so that
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:45.680]   when you come in as a customer and say well i've got you know i'm running you know emc uh storage
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:52.000]   and i i use vm where they can they can combine you know vx rail combine it all together in a way
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.480]   that uh you can show you yes this is going to work well with this this is what you need to do
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:03.040]   uh but what i also do which is amazing is they offer lab as a service a dedicated lab space
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.400]   within the advanced technology center where you as a customer can perform your own programmatic
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.680]   testing and you don't have to come to st louis you can do it 24/7 from anywhere in the world on
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:21.120]   demand and schedulable labs uh del emc vx rail you've got data protection center you've got IDPA
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:26.960]   all of the stuff in primary storage you might want to look at or be thinking about you can try
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:32.000]   and there are hundreds of labs to explore multi-cloud hyper converged infrastructure
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.520]   networking secondary storage data analytics ai it's all in the advanced technology center 24/7
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.040]   and it's available to you they've launched this digital platform the entire ecosystem is at your
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:50.960]   disposal and you really get a multiplier effect here of knowledge of speed of agility
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.360]   agility anytime anywhere around the world for customers and partners you'll get full access
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.280]   to everything not just hands-on lab but articles and case studies and all the tools you need
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:05.760]   to really make a difference in today's fast-paced world wwt just go to wwt.com/twit
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.240]   become a member of their growing community create an account get access to these on-demand labs at
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:16.160]   the atc and if you're in st louis march fifth we will see out there we'll announce we're going to
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:21.360]   have a meetup we'll go to stake and shake or something and get together it might be a breakfast
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:26.720]   meetup so i don't know but we're going to figure that out and if you are a wwt customer you know
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.120]   sign up for the panel that we're putting together it's going to be really interesting mary jofoli's
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:37.600]   coming out for it we're also getting alex lindsey out there because he has a lot of experience
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:43.120]   operating streaming in the cloud mike dorish from gartner it's going to be a great panel
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:49.760]   wwt march fifth ask him about it wwt.com/twit worldwide technology delivering business and
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:58.000]   technology outcomes around the world that was a very heavy conversation about windows 10x but i
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.440]   think it's really kind of exciting yes to think about it now when you it's just an emulator at
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:10.320]   this point daniel or can you yes it isn't the actual well it's an emulator but people are hacking
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.280]   it onto their computers to use this operating system i mean that's that's the internet for you
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:20.640]   but uh expect neo you know more information in september october uh march f always has their
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.600]   surface events then uh and we'll we'll get more wwt more build to about it and don't forget this
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:32.720]   isn't just for neo that's the flagship device but linnovo has the x1 fold uh there think pad fold
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:37.920]   coming out it's going to run windows 10 at first but they'll have a version windows 10x later uh
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:43.280]   del will have a foldable asus i think will have a foldable hp will too so this is a big thing
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:49.200]   so it's not just for that but uh yeah especially by end of year duo the android phone and i don't
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:54.640]   want to get too much hope up for this but we are hearing that that may come out earlier than uh
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:01.520]   fall or holiday season 2020 yeah so you know it's gonna trap me crazy i just bought the z-flip
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:07.440]   i had to buy the s20 for jason howl so he can cover it on all about android all the phone
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.720]   companies now have decided once a year's not enough apple samsung and google all have mid-year
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:18.800]   refreshes apple's gonna have new phones google's gonna have the fora and then in the fall we got a
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:25.440]   whole new thing from microsoft yeah so the duo uh you know it's in testing right now it's it's
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:30.480]   so there's different levels of testing have you seen it oh i i've held it so at the october event
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.920]   yeah but there was um uh it was about two weeks ago there was someone up in i believe this van
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.920]   kuber was in public using it so what's happened is oh i did i saw that video he was like in a
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:44.320]   subway yeah or a bus so they're allowing the employees to take it home and use it publicly and
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:49.360]   that that tells you they're more at an advanced stage you could tell in this twitter video that
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:54.320]   the employee knew he was being watched because he like he's he's playing with he's like showing
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:59.120]   stuff yeah he's he's not actively showing it to anybody but he knows somebody's recording this
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.560]   so they're yeah you know okay i can see it they're allowed to be caught with it in public they're
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.640]   not supposed to give interviews with it right then i doubt but if you're seeing he's pretty proud of
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:15.520]   it right yeah and so we we we may hear more about it at build um but they you know presumably may want
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.800]   to get into into developer hands at some point now pricing will be interesting uh it can obviously
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:26.080]   vary between the ram and storage configurations but being dual screen i've been told by oem's off
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:31.520]   the record when i've interviewed them that um you know dual screen is cheaper and easier to do
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:37.680]   than a folding display okay and so you know i know it's all the folding models are premium i mean
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:45.840]   they're yeah the galaxy folds 2000 this is 1400 yeah so for the galaxy flip so i wouldn't
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:52.480]   between a thousand and fifteen hundred depending on configuration i think is reasonable um but we
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.240]   have to kind of wait and see you know what what it's going to be but it's a very when closed the duo
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:03.120]   is as thin as the iphone that's why i think people don't understand how thin the technology is
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:09.440]   it does have the world's thinnest lcd displays or there could be ole but it's very thin so when
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.960]   you open it up it's it's crazy to hold um it's it's hard to and it looks bigger in this video i
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.000]   i know a lot people will see this and i think it's because her hands are oh it comes all the way
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.960]   around too yeah so you can use as a single screen device but when i got to hold it and see it and
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:27.120]   play with it i was just like this is way smaller like she's only like three foot tall she's got
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:34.240]   20 hands but it's a pretty like it feels it feels amazing to hold and use i'll just say that it's
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:39.840]   thin it's like it's like the it's about as wide as a passport but a little bit taller it seems like
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.560]   phones are getting more and more expensive it makes i wrote an article two years ago saying thousand
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:50.160]   dollar phones were coming and people were like oh you're crazy damn y'all you're crazy and i was
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.880]   and i was wrong because then we did a thousand dollar phones come but two left thousand thousand
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.560]   dollars with him like a year after that so um yeah we're we're in new era you know it's okay i don't
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.640]   think it's crazy though because leo think about this way you spend how much money on your car no it's
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:09.920]   my main computer really right i use it more than any other computer i own exactly and if something
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:15.280]   like decks i mean say one of the coolest product samsung makes that almost somebody talks about
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:21.760]   is decks i do because i can take this hyper powerful supercomputer that i walk around with and plug it
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.360]   like just put it in a dock and suddenly this is as powerful as as my desktop at least for the
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:33.600]   functions that most consumers need samsung announced that a few a few phones ago and they continue to
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.440]   update it and now it's got it's better and better i've decks running here on the windows machine
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:43.360]   um but it doesn't doesn't seem to gain a lot of traction the idea is that you have so much power
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.960]   now in this little thing in your pocket what do you need a desktop for our laptop just plug it into
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:53.440]   a keyboard mouse and monitor and and it's your computer and now all your data is on the phone
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.880]   where it's probably safer uh and you and you always have it with you has it but do you see people
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:06.880]   using decks now it's you never it's it's great but it's aspirational and it's i mean it shows us a
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:14.400]   future that much like uh daniel just detailed with windows is is a potential uh whether we get
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:21.120]   to there or not who knows but this is something that i mean it really for most consumers you don't do
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:28.000]   heavy media processing or editing the spreadsheets you use are fairly functional uh with well and
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.840]   you have the cloud now right this is where microsoft's been very smart about in fact uh they're
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.520]   talking about the edge all the time now edge devices and windows edge and and they and i think
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.880]   really what my i mean if from a 30,000 foot level what microsoft's really done is that our business
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:51.200]   is no longer desktop software our business is the cloud and we're going to see windows not as our
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:57.280]   bread and butter anymore but as a tool that that lets you use our real business azure
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   from the edge yes they did the same thing with xbox right the next xbox is just going to be a
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:10.640]   piece of hardware that accesses azure right that's the x cloud streaming uh gaming which is coming
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.920]   soon google's tried to do something like that with stadia to i don't think they've made it i have
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.840]   i have a friend who plays with stadia and they he raves about it and so i'm tempted to give it a
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:25.040]   try um but i think we can try that and i do not rave you're the but see they're very few i mean if
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.320]   you if you're a console gamer you don't need it if you're a pc gamer you don't know it is great geforce
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.480]   now lets you take the games you already own and i mean stadia's stadia's business is clearly
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:45.600]   white label right creating a product for uh it's a blizzard or oh yeah any any just pulled all
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.600]   their stuff off of geforce now geforce yeah i mean like i'd be shocked if stadia's actual businesses
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.040]   for consumers it's really a b2b product uh that allows but that's kind of what microsoft's doing
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:05.200]   they're offering right cloud services i mean sony's cloud is i mean sony who is microsoft's main
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:11.840]   competitor in gaming hardware their cloud is now is their cloud is has yeah yeah it's very interesting
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.240]   it doesn't care they'll sell to anybody right and in its room for this by the way is it's gonna be
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.960]   it's it's two is ambient computing in which also called ubiquitous computing this idea that we're
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:26.880]   eventually we'll just have a displays around us that are empty shells but you connect up to a cloud
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.960]   and run the operating system that way so every time i tell people about this they say well we
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:36.240]   already we had that we don't like it that's what we had and i had the client server yeah we had the
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.240]   big computer and then you had a little thin client and you were doing we didn't we didn't we got a
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:45.200]   when brought when broadband was not available yeah but you had a fast connection because you had a
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:52.640]   t1 line or whatever but now we then we got freedom we have our own seep one desk one cpu that's
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   that's what we fought for yes in the same as server wars of eight 1982 my cpu will not run run
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.320]   high-end games uh and i'm not and i'm not going to pay you need a better i'm not gonna pay
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:12.560]   five thousand dollars every two years to run games i will pay so what is the difference between the
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.600]   old days and today what what has happened well five the promise of five g that's where it comes
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:24.400]   in the cloud i mean the cloud is the the one technology that is everything else right five g
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:31.440]   iot edge all of these things are hyper serving of the cloud look at the battle that's going on
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:38.240]   this the joint the jedi project which is a ten billion oh yeah pentagon contract to run the next
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.120]   generation of pentagon cloud which meant you know has to be secure it has i mean there's a lot of
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.320]   requirements the pentagon had oh yeah they bid it out google was involved but their
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.480]   their engineers said yeah we don't want to work on a defense project so google bowed out then it
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:59.920]   was down to microsoft and amazon uh microsoft won it to the surprise of a lot of people who thought
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:06.560]   amazon was for sure aws is the obvious choice microsoft won it there was some thinking amazon
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:12.160]   said wait a minute this is because president trump hence hates jeff bezos and we bet he
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.480]   he put his fingers in the in the works and threw it to microsoft they sued and a judge on thursday
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:24.640]   said whoa hold on a minute microsoft did not win this contract he put a temporary restraining order
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:30.160]   in injunction and said we got to look into this that is how important these businesses are now
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:35.200]   ten billion dollars over ten years and it's more isn't right because that's a put in the door it's
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.440]   ten billion dollars but the it's guaranteed service and larger contracts after that so you become the
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:46.720]   pentagon's main cloud provider right whoever wins this that's big let's go back to the top of the
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:50.000]   show and leah was talking about what we talk about on twitter over time and people say don't
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.800]   bring up politics leave it alone how do you not yet again yeah you know how to not take it
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.360]   tech is not a vertical it is a horizontal and it's woven through everything that we do
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.000]   love it or lump it it's a horizontal that's a new one i've never heard that phrase before
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.720]   look at this look at what yes you have you've got vertical markets what's the opposite of a
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.840]   vertical market to be clear i've heard about horizontal integration mattress a horizontal
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:19.200]   no that casser in public and that was terrible i just like they damn phrased it you jeez okay i'll
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:27.120]   tell you how i'll tell you how much tech has invaded the real world the oscars sunday night tikah
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:33.840]   wahiti wins an oscar for best right like goes backstage at the press conference they say
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:40.240]   tikah you just won the academy ward what are you doing now most of the time people would say i'm
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:47.440]   going to Disneyland instead he says apples got to fix their macbook keyboard they're impossible
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:55.040]   to write on they're getting worse it makes me want to go back to pcs he even complained he's got rsi
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.840]   from the darn thing it's the most i've seen one of these war shows actually have a good news item
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:06.560]   that i cared about isn't that hysterical i love this guy he's not wrong you know because first of
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:11.280]   all i think his movies are absolutely fantastic jojo rabbit is desert i was really disappointed
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:16.400]   it's so the parisation out of one jojo rabbit is an amazing movie but i think any movie that has
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:21.520]   hitler prancing around again i was a little awkward people are yes a little awkward people go i
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:26.400]   love the little kids they were just they i was just great i almost got diabetes it was so sweet but
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:32.640]   it's so sweet but i like it and he did thorar ragnarok which was one of the funniest films the
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:40.000]   only good thor yeah absolutely so this guy like you know i i think his humanity is strong his empathy
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.600]   like he's just really good but this had been cracking up i obviously have a little bias towards pc but
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:51.280]   you know i thought it was a pretty good shot he looks gotta be cringing i don't know if apple
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:57.040]   went to the oscars but you have an oscar when i'm going backstage and the first thing he says
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:02.240]   make decent keyboards apple you know on the one hand it's good for apple because he says i want
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:07.200]   to use a mac right yeah i mean that's a funny thing right this is the classic apple thing which is
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.800]   you you complain about it and you're mad and then you still will buy the next mac right so like
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:17.920]   giving me rsi but i still want to use you i mean we went through what three four years of those
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:21.600]   butterflies which is and people you know like getting really mad but people just get bogged
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:27.120]   um like i have spent hundreds on mechanical keyboards since then i mean hundred yeah
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:33.840]   well all four of us type a lot yes anybody uses computers types a lot you guys right so you
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:39.280]   type more than the average bear and i don't know how you do it on a mac but any of this well you get
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:46.000]   one of these Leo i do have an external keyboard yeah so this is even that's a great keyboard
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.520]   you gotta have you gotta have the microsoft ergo keyboard that's oh put that away i'm not 85 years
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:56.320]   old it makes me know i was just looking at it it's like i have not seen one of those in years it's
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:03.200]   bent that's a brand new one get a code keyboard from WASM i used to have that cherry switches it's
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.960]   got it uh big travel it it feels good when you type on it i have them everywhere because i
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:15.280]   okay so i run a full size mechanical gaming keyboard with windows 10 and i love that i love
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.760]   the sounds i love the typing but i will say that little mac um external that i just held up
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:25.120]   is probably the thing i'm fastest on in the world yeah any key ever gives and to me that is a feat and
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:29.600]   so if apple could just kind of take that and put it into my macbook pro i would give them more money
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:34.240]   that doesn't really have uh much key travel though that keyboard that's the little bluetooth apple
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:39.920]   uh yeah it's a middle point between what i would want and what the current the preceding generation
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.920]   of macbook pros which i'm using now has and so to me it's kind of the conference between the
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:49.360]   the apple way of little travel and having enough it's actually usable so it's yeah it's kind of a
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.040]   happy but to your point daniel i have stock home syndrome because i just keep buying
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:33:00.000]   laptops hoping i did buy the 16 inch the new one and it's actually usable it's not yeah right great
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.640]   but it's a lot better than a butterfly key you know the best desktop best desktop for its price
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:14.880]   is the new raspberry pi for so really so dan i had a kid on the radio show he called me from
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:21.120]   pama the mayorka in spain his name is kai he was so cute he was sixth grader 12 years old
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:27.520]   and he calls in i said are you live there he said yeah but we're just a little bit my dad's a tour
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.600]   guide we're going back to the states in a few months i said okay he said i have a question about
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:38.720]   the raspberry pi i have a raspberry pi for i've already written a voice assistant with it i said
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:43.840]   oh what do you call it she says call lola i said can you say hey lola he said no it just tells you
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:48.960]   the time the weather wikipedia that kind of thing i wanted to face recognition but i can't get my
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:55.360]   camera to with python is there a python library guys 12 is there a python library i wanted to face
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:01.120]   recognition on my raspberry pi for and this is my argument he actually had a deeper voice than that
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:08.240]   but it is my argument for uh when a kid when a 12 year old says i want a computer dad don't give
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:14.880]   him a pc no get a raspberry pi yeah 35 bucks and you just don't stew yeah throw it at him and say
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.320]   figure it out kid and they're motivated they're gonna i got to play minecraft on this thing don't
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:24.240]   figure it out but then they'll never go outside again once they learn how to program a raspberry
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.600]   pi they're never gonna be throwing coronavirus no coronavirus i will say inside right and i will
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:34.880]   say from personal experience that the keyboard that they send you with the raspberry pi that you
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:43.040]   get from raspberry pi is way better than a mackey so good 35 dollars right that whole desktop kid is
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:48.800]   like 119 bucks so the raspberry pi and mouse a keyboard and some heat sinks do you get a screen
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:52.640]   or do you have to look at that look at that keyboard you don't get a monitor you have to buy a monitor
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.680]   or use you know right these dads old monitor yeah it's pretty impressive and the fact that the kid
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.360]   wrote a voice assistant now wants to work on fake race recognition on a raspberry pi
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:10.160]   back to optimism what oh yeah that makes me optimistic that's really good news i like
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.520]   them but to turn like what the kids are doing to get excited because the adults bum us out
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.120]   but with the kids like oh but then there's gonna be a good future all right cool you are getting
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:22.560]   old alix because that's how old people feel and then we say get off of my lawn you kids
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:30.560]   when you're rap music and you're bell bottom pants i've always been 112 years old at heart
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.720]   i think you're gonna catch it up slowly with mine oh man you always have it's pretty funny uh

[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:03.120]   yet done the twit survey twit.to/survey20 or just go to twit.tv it's on the front page there it's
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.400]   just a few pages a couple of questions it's the we don't track you you know one of the great
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.480]   things about podcasting is there's no way for us to to do anything but but give you nice content
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.200]   and maybe see how many downloads we get we can't tell anything about you so this survey helps us
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:24.720]   both understand you better for our own uses and also for advertising it's very we do it once a
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:30.800]   year and it's very helpful so twit.to/survey20 it's completely voluntary we don't ask for an email
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:34.080]   or any personal information we just kind of want to get know you a little bit better
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:39.440]   but it does help us thank you i have to say i'm a little nervous because as spotify starts to eat
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:44.320]   the podcast world maybe we'll talk about that next because they just bought yet another big
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:49.440]   podcast network and i'm a little nervous that's their goal is to track you because if you use
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.960]   the spotify app they know everything about you including your credit card so we'll talk about
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:01.920]   that in just a second our show today brought to you by express vpn if you're look if you travel
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.000]   if you go around the world i know dan you've worked with journalists to teach them how to operate
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.680]   securely in countries where the government's really keeping an eye on you a vpn is critical
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:16.960]   virtual private network when you're at an online you know open access point a wi-fi at the coffee
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.240]   shopper on the cruise shipper at a hotel the vpn is going to protect your privacy by encrypting
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:28.320]   everything you do as it egresses your computer and then goes to the vpn server somewhere out there
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:33.200]   in the world and then into the public internet that way the people in between just can't see
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:39.600]   you no man in the middle no spying but if you think about it you're just kicking the security and
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:46.560]   privacy can down the road the vpn server you're using is going to get all the information too
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:54.400]   so you got to get a vpn company you can trust and i trust express vpn they don't log your data
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.880]   they can't log your data they can't keep track of what you're doing because they use a technology
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:05.760]   called trusted server they developed it themselves when you start a vpn session and it's easy to do
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:11.600]   they've got clients for android ios mac windows linux when you start a session it spins up a
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:18.320]   trusted server on the express vpn address that you're going to and you can choose anywhere in the
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:25.920]   world spins it up you use it when you close that session it spins it down and the entire time it
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:32.480]   operates in a sandbox it cannot write to disk that means it cannot log anything you're doing and i
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:37.440]   don't i don't you know i mean yes of course express vpn says this but i gotta tell you they've had
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:42.800]   third party audits that say they had honored their privacy policy that this trusted server works
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:50.640]   exactly as they say it does we also know from court cases uh where governments in the case of one
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:56.720]   government turkey they didn't use a warrant they just barged in on the express vpn took the servers
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:02.000]   they there was nothing on them they couldn't do anything with it so you don't have to just trust
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.280]   me you don't have to trust the third parties governments have tried and failed express vpn is
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:11.360]   also fast this is the other reason you're going to want to use it one of the reasons people use
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:15.920]   a vpn is to change their geographic location you can serve choose the server closest to you
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.960]   and most of the time you'll do that but you might also want to choose a server say in japan so you
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:27.280]   can watch netflix japan normally that is not a good experience with express vpn is because they're
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:32.080]   very very fast i don't know how they're doing it maybe it's their servers maybe it's their network
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:37.680]   but you're able to stream hd quality video with zero lag anywhere in the world and i know this
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:44.880]   because i've tried it i actually i turn on express vpn went to japan was watching some anime on japanese
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.800]   netflix and forgot to turn it off i left express vpn running on my ipad for days i forgot and i
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:58.480]   didn't even notice because it's that fast it is easy to use it's fast it's secure it's what you
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:03.440]   want to vpn and you don't have to just take my word for it tech radar the verge cnet many other
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:09.680]   tech experts have rated express vpn number one you will too now you're going to say i know i hear
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.960]   from people oh i got a free vpn this is great there's no such thing as a free lunch if you're
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:19.920]   getting a free vpn they're doing something to monetize it most likely they're selling your data or
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:26.160]   they're injecting ads into your stream there are vpn providers that do that express vpn does not
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.320]   in fact work the best deal is to sign up for a year and get an extra three months when you go
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:37.680]   to express vpn.com/twit for the best vpn service you will use it all the time it's that easy it's
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:46.080]   that fast express vpn.com/twit it's the one i use them when i recommend express vpn.com/twit
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:51.200]   thank you express vpn for sponsoring the twitch show and thank you twitter listener for using that
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:43:02.480]   special address express vpn.com/twit let's see what i use express vpn just last week there you go
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:08.240]   it's i was in jamaica which by the way shut out to jamaica nice huh it was nice amazing love
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:12.640]   jamaica love the people it was just people are so fantastic can't wait to go back but i want to
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:18.880]   stream tv and this is the lesson i learned which is i've been toying between slang and youtube tv
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:25.200]   recently slinging on pc i can use express vpn and sling worked beautifully it's not amazing
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.720]   you don't expect tv would block though it worked on the phone but i was using an
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.200]   iphone at the time and an iphone with the tv is pointless so you know i was a little concerned
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:40.320]   because express vpn wanted us to tout how you could use nefflux with express vpn and and watch
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:45.600]   nefflux anywhere in the world i thought is that legal and i checked and nefflux said yeah we just
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.600]   we don't like you to do it because it's too slow and you're going to get a bad experience
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.640]   but it's perfectly you pay it you have an efflux account so from their point of view it's fine if
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:59.920]   you're in jamaica to to surf to the u_s with express vpn and as long as you can do it and
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:03.920]   and that's the nice thing lu in uh lu marescos in our chat room says he was in debi
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:11.840]   and used express vpn to watch tv at home uh and it worked so that's a it's only one that has
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:16.320]   worked for me so far hulu and i enjoy hulu's service although it's too expensive so i drop
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:21.360]   them but i couldn't never get them to work through vpn any vpn i try not to know how you know there's
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:26.800]   no is there a fingerprint i don't think so i think that they have to do it by ip address i'm not sure
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.400]   how they would know you're on a vpn i don't think there's a always did but they always do
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:36.320]   sling was the only one that was all you'll to bypass on psa well express vpn says it works with hulu
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:41.520]   uh it works with uh Netflix it works with i think they say it works with sling and youtube tv too
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.240]   so they may be doing something i don't know yeah i've tried i've tried with other vpn's and
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:50.240]   my kids have tried to get my tunnel bear they block immediately have tried to get into Netflix
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:56.240]   japan to watch their anime shows but um those oh cool idea my my vpn does not work for that express
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:01.520]   vpn they can they know they know which uh ip's i think that's it i think they rotate through them
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:04.800]   and that's right express vpn yeah you have seeded up for a little while too yeah
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:12.080]   meanies so uh what was i gonna ask you Alex i was gonna ask you about something podcast and
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:18.480]   Spotify oh yeah so um Spotify just bought the ringer bill simmons podcast network you remember
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.760]   bill simmons from espn got fired six months six years ago because he
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:28.880]   i guess he was cranky i don't know and he said we'll screw you espn i'm gonna start a podcast
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:35.280]   network and do sports quite successfully 30 shows they also do a movie you watch along with them
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:41.120]   they do a couple of other uh culture shows just sold to spotify can i tell you this was a knife
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:46.800]   in my heart then just because they're basically the same size as we are we have 25 shows or something
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:54.240]   they have 30 they have 18 million in revenue we have like 11 uh 141 million dollars base
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:46:04.480]   and if they perform and bill doesn't quit in a huff 194 million dollars for a freaking podcast
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:12.320]   network uh Leo i mean this is you're underpaid is what i'm here i am underpaid what did i do wrong
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:17.920]   um i'm thrilled for bill i think it's great and ringer's great and he's done a great job and it's
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.760]   with their very good podcast they probably have a bigger audience than us because i think more
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:31.040]   people are into sport ball than technology um however i'm impressed yeah so i i wanted to talk
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:36.320]   about this because i just got access to the podcast that i'm on with tech runches spotify
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:42.480]   analytics and this was revelation what do they know well what what i was really fascinated to find
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.200]   out it has the usual stuff like where you've been downloaded where you've been streamed that's
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.960]   sort of thing how many people stream your show whatever but the the data point that i had that i
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.680]   really found fascinating was because they have the player built in they can tell you how long people
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:58.320]   are listening to your show as percentage and one thing advertisers always ask and i bet they
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:05.360]   ask you is did they hear our ad yes and the we don't know that we only know if the show is downloaded
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:10.000]   it's like asking a magazine did they did they see our ad i don't know they got the magazine i
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:16.160]   hope they read it i don't know you can't prove it now but now i can say yes we put in a small teaser
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:21.120]   ad say at the 18-minute mark and we know that 74.5 people were still listening to that point
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.240]   and the cool thing for me and this was a real like a uh way off my shoulders was that nearly
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.600]   everyone finished the show i was terrified we were going to get this data and find that everyone
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:34.160]   listened for three minutes and skip the whole you know uh but that was a it was a day point that i
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:37.840]   didn't know that i wanted to have but once i had it i couldn't i don't want to know that
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:46.080]   our shows how long's your show uh between 25 and 35 well the hell couldn't finish that our shows go
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:54.560]   on and on and on and on yes not only does this is a validate the podcast market it provides it
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:58.960]   such a competitive advantage uh for better or worse this is well i have a theory
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:04.960]   go ahead Dan i'll tell you my theory no no no your theory so i have a theory because there's no way
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:11.360]   if a company makes 18 revenue not profit they have 90 employees we have 25 so i think their
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:19.120]   revenue is probably very their profits fairly low lower than ours i would guess uh so there's no way
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:24.960]   they're worth a hundred times profit what it Alex you're a bit you're cover business
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:31.520]   what's what's the typical multiple that companies go for so you're talking about a price earnings
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:37.520]   ratio right and off of 18 million let's say they made a profit of two million that'd be a 100x multiple
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:42.320]   of the worth about 200 including incentives 100 seems high it seems there there's certainly not
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:48.480]   being valued on their their profit is not saying oh we'll make our money back in a hundred years no
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:55.040]   what there's spotify is saying is that you will not uh you will not give up your bill Simmons
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:00.480]   apparently you will stay to all my subscribers yes exactly and we'll put these only on spotify
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:05.520]   in time all you apple music dorks don't get them now so ha ha ha and at eight 10 12 bucks a month
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:09.760]   you can make my money relatively quickly it's a cool gambit and and that the subtext you're the
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:14.480]   background is that spotify's margins their gross margins are quite low because they don't own the
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.720]   content they streams they're stuck about 25 percent which doesn't change they now
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:23.120]   and I think part of this is because the record they worried they have the Netflix problem right
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:27.840]   Netflix got got pressured by the movie companies and they couldn't get the good movies so they
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.640]   end up making their own and that worked well so spotify is looking at that saying we live at the
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.960]   pleasure of these crap record companies they could put us out of business anytime we better have
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:41.600]   our own content yes and that's exactly what they're making their own content but I think they're
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.560]   only way that you know they paid 200 million for gimlet they paid almost 200 million for
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.920]   for ringer the only way these companies are worth that kind of money is if spotify could
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:58.320]   corner the podcast market they're trading it like a zero sum they want to corner the market
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:04.640]   and and here's how the here's the methodology for doing that and by the way we will never
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:10.400]   I believe in RSS I want our shows to be everywhere and I want you to be able to use any client you
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.840]   want that is a problem because we won't have the information about you but we know our audience
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:21.280]   doesn't want that we won't have the information about you that spotify has if spotify can go to
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:26.240]   advertisers say well you shouldn't buy ads on twit they don't know anything about their audience
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.320]   we know everything about your audience we can even tell you if they are how many people heard your
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:38.160]   ad and will charge you based on that instead advertising will dry up for RSS true podcast will
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:45.600]   dry up and it will only exist for spotify companies that can tell you that kind of information and
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:52.480]   the reason I have this conspiracy theory is that's what happened to the web ah with advertising it
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:51:01.840]   became apps ad tech ad tech transformed the web into the junk pile it is today and I fear that
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.080]   it's going to happen to podcasting and I think all the only reason spotify can say well it's worth
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:11.120]   half a billion dollars to buy all these podcasts because we'll corner the market and
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:15.440]   you know down the road all the all the revenue will come to us
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:20.320]   I mean maybe I mean spotify is making a big bet I mean apple is not going to take this
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:24.640]   laying down they'll have a similar it's risky yeah there's also diesel out there there's still a
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:29.920]   lot of players so this isn't a foregone conclusion but most podcasters want to want to do what we're
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:36.400]   doing I don't think Marco Arman who makes overcast is going to move his podcast to spotify that
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:41.600]   wouldn't ever happen and so and we're not and so I have a feeling that what's going to happen is
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:45.920]   it's going to be a hard battle but they're going but but the scary thing is they're going to put
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:50.880]   pressure on us because advertisers which is our lifeblood without advertising we have no revenue
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:59.840]   if advertisers buy this plan mmm your favorite podcast could go away I I wouldn't worry about
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:03.360]   Twit though because the Twit audience so far as I can tell but haven't been on the show for you
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:07.040]   know often on for a couple years is pretty dedicated but I think this could really attack
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:11.600]   the middle class of podcast that's like you guys yeah I'm not worried about for myself but
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:17.120]   you're exactly right I worry very much for the vibrant exciting podcasting is kind of like the
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:21.600]   web used to be with blogs and creating anybody wanting to write about stuff and often they could
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:27.200]   get ads google kind of constant google and facebook concentrated at all and ended up kind of squeezing
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:31.920]   out all those middle middle tier and low tier stuff you either do it as a hobby
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:37.600]   or or you or you have to join somebody big because there's nowhere in the middle to live and I think
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:40.640]   that's what's going to happen to worry that's what's going to happen to podcasting it's going to be
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:44.960]   too bad a lot of a lot of really fun independent creators will lose their revenue streams and then
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:49.360]   the work will become a little bit too much I mean podcasting people don't realize is tons of work
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:55.520]   editing guests distribution analytics sales I mean like it's not a simple process and if the
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:00.160]   revenue goes down that might just not be worth it for this kind of you know middle 80 percent of
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:04.800]   the podcast market which is a huge chunk of the shows people enjoy and love but aren't big enough
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:11.120]   to probably get past this lack of data but Spotify the data that give you isn't always good or welcome
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:18.560]   because I was told the the artists that equity listeners my podcast what they listen to and it
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:25.520]   was disappointing so I advertise you don't care if you're disappointed advertisers want to know
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:29.120]   that and they're going to say to you you know we're not going to pay what you're asking because I
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:34.400]   can I'm looking at you know what I'm saying is that this is yeah this is all about empowering
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:40.400]   advertisers and disempowering content creators okay but one last point on that because we have the
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:46.000]   information from Spotify we can kind of presume that that works across other platforms right so
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.400]   because we know Spotify says on Spotify you have 80 percent listening or rated at 30 minutes or
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:54.400]   whatever it is right then I can kind of say well probably the same thing on Apple podcasts and so
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:58.560]   forth so I can actually use the Spotify data if I'm smart talk about my other platform and you
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:03.360]   maybe give myself more firepower a temporary band aid to your broader point but I'm hoping that
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:08.160]   there's some little room there for for folks like my show it just isn't huge but also isn't small
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:13.360]   right it's an intro I don't know I this is kind of inside baseball I'm sorry I brought it up I'm
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:19.120]   just jealous I mean I want 200 million dollars as well so I tell you what Spotify if you want to buy
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:25.520]   equity we all got a number 20 million we all got another deal yeah um
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:31.600]   Susan Wojcicki it's kind of related says that YouTube has paid the music industry more than
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:38.160]   three billion dollars last year in ad revenue but for the first time ever the you google alphabet
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:42.880]   has been forced to reveal information about YouTube about yes you know and this and it's
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:51.440]   oh it's quite interesting it's the same conversation I mean YouTube is effectively a large podcast
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:56.960]   platform exactly and Google sells you or offers a ten dollar a month subscription right
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:05.760]   YouTube ads generated 15 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019 fourth quarter was 4.72 billion
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:12.080]   and it paid actually paid a surprisingly I don't have the numbers in front of me but they did for
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.720]   the first time I think say how much of that revenue went to creators did they Alex I can't
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:21.360]   remember I forget if that was broken up that would be a cost of revenue number I believe for
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:26.480]   that should be disclosed eventually but I was surprised by the scale of YouTube I thought it was
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:30.240]   going to be quite large in the billions but I didn't think it was going to be you know just under 5
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:35.840]   billion in Q4 alone that's amazing yeah and I'm really curious about the breakdown of who makes
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:40.320]   that money because if you look at some accounts on on YouTube they're shockingly large
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.880]   Eminem just did a big thing on Twitter and social media about one of his videos reaching a
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.280]   billion views you know five six years ago a billion views was I think you know not even
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:53.440]   something that happened get a little one artist kind of several videos had a billion or more so
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:56:00.560]   the scale of YouTube I think we underestimate as an industry and as a group of watchers of tech
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:04.640]   and I think that there's been more cultural growth there than we kind of give Google slash
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:11.200]   alphabet credit for and the revenues followed it and and and dang 15.5 billions a lot of money for
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:14.800]   for a Google that's a big chunk of their growth in the last couple years I think yeah yeah
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:23.760]   it's to put it in perspective it makes them bigger than discovery channel I I'm not surprised
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:33.200]   NBC CBS ABC size it makes them discovery channel size you know I think in part of it's I mean
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:37.280]   they're going after now that's that's the funny thing YouTube used to be all about that independent
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:42.480]   creator and now they're they're going after the big corporate money right all the big networks and
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:47.040]   that's what's big and playing about YouTube is it's you go to the front page and now it's NBC
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:52.320]   CBS it's clips from the late show it's it's it's getting away from almost the smaller independent
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:58.160]   stuff but I imagine YouTube sees that revenue coming in from having this content and the fact is a
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:04.720]   lot of people that's how they get they don't watch the the full TV show. I got to say Mark has Brownly
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:12.800]   M. K. B. K. B. H. D. just interviewed Bill Gates I mean that's a huge get that video I showed
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:17.120]   from Jerry rig everything where he destroys a $1400 phone he can afford it he's got five and
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:21.840]   a half million subscribers that video alone came out yesterday has half a million views
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:28.000]   the numbers are massive on YouTube yeah there's what is it 18 year old who makes I mean an
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.920]   eight year old I'm sorry an eight year old who makes like 13 million a year on YouTube yeah for the
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:39.760]   kid reviews or whatever yeah I think the problem is though it's sort of like you know we hold up
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:44.160]   the Brownleys and everybody and we look at that like wow that's amazing but the question is what's
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:49.680]   the entry you know it's a long tail yeah yeah because those people have been doing it for a long
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:54.400]   time like they got in early 2012 they've been doing and really slogging through that's probably
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:58:00.400]   one of the hardest things about YouTube is is being consistent right it's not just being a hit it's
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:05.840]   being hit and then coming back next Tuesday next Thursday next Tuesday next and always doing it for
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:10.480]   years right and what you end up having courses people learn you know that actually it's really
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:15.760]   hard to do a successful YouTube channel because you have to be that's all you have to do if you
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:21.440]   take time off it's it can ruin it just like game streaming right so but I do question whether or
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:26.800]   not it still has that same you know if you want to go do that today could you do that right I think
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:32.560]   it's it's increasingly difficult and now having corporate customers come into the mix you're competing
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:37.760]   with that it's it's getting really hard Dan last time we talked to you you were I think pretty
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:43.840]   concerned about the security of political campaigns a concern that's been born out over the last few
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:51.040]   campaigns you've done was it you who were training campaigns and teaching them how to secure themselves
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:56.400]   I know you did that for reporters and dissidents yeah I've never done that for us political
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:01.360]   campaigns I've also never been a Republican or a Democrat because I cover these campaigns
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:07.440]   it's like me buying Apple stock you just can't do it right it's all about trust and and if I'm a
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:16.240]   partisan one way or the other I hold fashion I have certainly I have worked in Darfur and Egypt in
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:23.200]   the UAE and trained journalists and migrants in those countries not just how to create media but
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:29.040]   how to use encryption on their mobile devices so that they can stay safe and secure but in US
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:35.360]   politics I will cover the security of election systems button and the elections but certainly
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:42.320]   not take a side either way I have to say I'm proud of Google they're offering free security keys to
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:51.040]   US political campaigns these are made in China just just might want to point out but yeah I think
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:56.720]   that's a that's an important thing I actually use Google's advanced protection on my Google accounts
[01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:02.160]   and it limits a lot of the things I'd like to do like embedding Google Docs and so forth but
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:08.000]   I do it because you know that's the there's a few accounts I cannot afford to get
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:13.840]   you know given away get hacked and that's one of them so using these keys I think is a really
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:19.520]   good idea and I would hope that campaigns if they're still using Gmail or using advanced protection
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:25.280]   or you talk about being a target I mean the entire world wants to get I mean it's not just one nation
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:30.640]   state now it's a collection of them that are all going to come after you this is why after so much
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:34.560]   me putting it off I finally moved to a password manager and joined the 21st century
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:41.120]   yeah yeah two points to me as we come to you for now with LastPass studios yeah
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:45.440]   oh I'm actually a must pass and one password customer so there you go how about that I'm
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:51.120]   gonna have to pick one it gets really confusing if you use one I have to because I review other
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:55.920]   ones but I realize that the real risk is I'm gonna put a password in one and it's not me and the other
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:01.760]   so I use LastPass and I just said you know what I'll let somebody else review all the other ones but
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:08.560]   I segregate just like Alex does you do some business and personal yeah no I have that I put
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:15.280]   different priority of passwords in in different password managers simply because I mean the same
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:21.040]   reason like if one password is compromised another one oh that's clever instead of trusting
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:28.480]   one yeah not just LastPass or OnePass or the those are my two favorites and we should you know
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:34.240]   per election security this is certainly not about politics but there are adversaries who
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:42.400]   have particular strategic goals and the strategic goal of Russia is not necessarily this is
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.720]   incredibly important we should care about voting machines and election systems and that kind of
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:52.720]   thing but really the strategic goal is to undermine our faith and confidence in the mechanisms of
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:58.320]   democracy as well as elections it would be naive to think that their goal is to get one or
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:03.920]   other candidate exactly right that's not their goal their goal is to create chaos yes and that's
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:07.920]   exactly right there was a New York Times article where the headline was chaos is the point and that
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:15.040]   is the point and to that end we need to pay attention to more than we shouldn't over index on the
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:19.280]   hardware of election systems we should pay attention to those but we should also pay attention to
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:28.240]   things like influence operations the use of of propaganda and undermining the way american
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:34.240]   feel and liberal democracy feels about in the integrity of our election systems this is
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:38.560]   incredibly important because we will see all of these under attack through 2020 and beyond
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:44.880]   i want to take a quick break there is so much more to talk about and we're already at the
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:49.520]   two hour mark so let me get a break in and then we'll i'll try to do about 20 stories in five
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:55.200]   minutes here five yeah and guys i love you Leo you have to take off Dan hop off yeah yeah but you
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:01.200]   guys are fantastic i daniel and alex i learned so much from you leo thank you thank you thank you
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:06.480]   uh stick around you too though alex willham from a tech crunch and daniel or bino from uh
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:09.680]   windows central if you can because there are a few more things and i'd love to get your
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:14.640]   a take on it our show today brought to you by health IQ health IQ is interesting it's a life
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:21.280]   insurance agency that specializes in healthy people so as you probably know thanks to
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:28.800]   statistics to actuarial statistics healthy people essentially pay for the unhealthy people
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:35.200]   but the problem is you deserve better rates if you take care of yourself if if you do everything
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:40.240]   right for your health you exercise you know every day or four times a week you get a minimum of eight
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.880]   hours of sleep you're you're eating right you know what to do you're taking care of yourself
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:52.880]   you ought to get a bit lower rate but how do you get that lower rate uh i always use as an example
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:59.440]   ant pro at one of our hosts who is a lifter his body mass index is in the 30s which any insurance
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:05.840]   company is going to say well you're obese he's not obese he's got a 29 inch waist he's got 29 inch
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:11.360]   biceps that's the problem and because his BMI is so high that number to an insurance company is
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:16.960]   meaningless you need health IQ they're basically a concierge service for people like ant they go
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:24.000]   to the insurance companies they say no no no wait a minute it's not obese ants fit health IQ uses
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.480]   science and data to secure lower life insurance rates for people like you and as an example you
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:36.720]   can get a million dollar life insurance policy for 36 dollars a month there's no reason to pay more
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:41.680]   you just got to let your insurance company know in fact health IQ works with the top 30 insurance

[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:11.040]   got the Theranos Theranos conspiracy charges thrown out on Wednesday I thought that the judge
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:17.520]   it's there's really it's a case against Theranos found her Elizabeth Holmes remember she claimed
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:22.880]   that she had a way to do blood tests with just a drop of blood it turned out it didn't work
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:28.720]   she and her company not even close uh her company president Sonny Balwani
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:34.640]   were on trial but the judges thrown out some of the charges the defense team argued prosecutor's
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:40.000]   case was too broad and too vague the defense team tried to get all 11 charges thrown out
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:46.160]   saying that the the charges were full of ambiguity and fudging language good lawyers
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:53.280]   uh the judge did rule that they can't charge homes in Balwani with conspiracy to defraud
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:07:00.400]   doctors and patients since insurance for wire fraud yeah insurance paid for those tests so
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:06.880]   the patients weren't harmed the judge also throughout charges claiming the duo conspired to
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:15.040]   have doctors make fraudulent statements but they are only off the hook for the conspiracy charges
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:21.120]   they still face nine counts of wire fraud and that trial begins August 2020
[02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:28.880]   what a story it is you know yeah so I I read the book bad blood on a flight isn't that a good
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:33.680]   book oh it was I but I had this you know multi-hour period of time I just sat down in the SFO and
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:38.880]   I finished it when I landed in Boston and uh it was an amazing story to read back to back and I
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:42.000]   ended up watching some of the the films that are out there about it I think there's documents
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:50.560]   raised well um if they don't end up with some jail time my personal non-legal view this is just an
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:54.400]   opinion I'm not trying to stay anything more than that is that uh it was going to encourage more
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.880]   people to be this sketchy with the truth yeah why not take a chance if you know why not yeah you
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:03.680]   know it's just a reputation that's it but I mean if they because they spent a lot of money they raised
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:07.840]   a lot of money they spent a lot of money they projected huge revenues they had essentially no
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:13.760]   revenues uh you know this is like as stretched as things can get if not blatantly false and
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:19.600]   fraudulent so I watch other other companies in the tech space don't you don't we have to name names
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:25.200]   that are doing something similar uh they have to be in the startup field it has to be yeah there
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:31.120]   a lot of them I think yeah I think that's right I think we saw you biome fall apart I think um
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:37.040]   such as biotech I mean there's some names people know that are probably full of it
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.760]   yeah I think a lot of companies that claim AI are not actually AI whatsoever I think they're
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:45.280]   actually just using humans behind the scene to to create the illusion of more intelligent
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:49.120]   computing systems that's what Theranos was doing basically they were using other people's
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:55.120]   machines to do the blood assays yeah these are your problems I mean Alex is probably very good to
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:59.360]   speak at this but this is as a someone doesn't cover this stuff this is the way I see I always
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:04.400]   find venture capital and startup strange because I remember back in the day where you used to have
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:08.160]   to make a product and go to the market and sell the product and then you took the money made from
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:12.080]   that product and invested back in your company that's crazy talked annual and he just kept doing
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:16.480]   that but at least there was a product that you were actually selling and you can make projections
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:20.480]   versus this idea of like well we have this idea for this thing and if you just give us money we
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:25.040]   can actually make it like I get that as a bank loan to start your business but this idea that
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:30.640]   these companies just take billions or millions at least and you know and give you know it just
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:34.800]   supposed to be a billion dollar company on the promise of someday we may figure out a business
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:40.320]   model how to make money off of this is just so weird to me like yeah like you know like you know
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:45.360]   my politics are pretty lefty but like when it comes to that like all right we're gonna have
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:50.400]   capitalism but what is this thing this isn't really capitalism anymore it's some weird you know
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:55.200]   there's a book out right now lab rats which are reading uh which is really good yeah yeah and
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:00.080]   that's like just a page turner but it goes through talking about how yeah these companies now you know
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:04.960]   they build up they take the money and then they sell off and they run off you know it just I don't
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:10.560]   know it feels kind of weird to me okay so some general thoughts about that one I hear where
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:15.600]   you're coming from yeah there has been an explosion in the amount of venture capital that has been
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:22.000]   available and so that has led to some silly things being funded but they shouldn't make you think
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.840]   that the the venture model itself is uh is always a bad idea or always not a good fit for certain
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:33.520]   companies what it lets you do is hire very far ahead of your company's revenues if you have an
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:37.760]   idea that could have broad application and so with this kind of capital acceleration you can go
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:41.440]   to market more quickly take market share disrupting incumbents and do a lot of the stuff that we
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:46.000]   kind of want on split the only people lose money are these rich venture capitalists so it's not
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:51.600]   like the there's harm done well careful because they raise from they raise from calpers they raise
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:56.560]   from university funds they raise from that's calpers fault with that's by the way the retirement
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:02.880]   fund for uh cal California state right but they put in a small amount of that their overall asset
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:07.040]   pool into kind of more exotic investments they should be that smart because if you hit a google
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:11.840]   they're you know you're you're multiple can be hit that's what drives it right it's just the
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:17.760]   idea of facebook right or even whatsapp right there are these companies that created a product
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:21.600]   then got valued and sold for a ton of money but then we just saw this week was that that
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:29.600]   hq trivia app hq that's that another story we're gonna do obituary's hq yeah yeah scott rogowski
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:35.120]   smart he got out of there before uh before it got a little twitter thing he had to do with that
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:40.800]   yeah yeah in fact the last hq that was the trivia thing to y'all we all did it right we
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:45.680]   i never played it i never played it on a crazy really it was so much my whole family once in
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:50.880]   sunnyville the yeah you stand in a circle and you and then everybody does it it was streaming it was
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:56.080]   uh lots of money and it was the problem is the first six questions were really easy and the next
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:00.480]   six were really really hard they're impossibly hard it was like i'm smart i'm smart i'm smart
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:06.480]   i'm in his heart and he's done his personal life rogowski made it fun he left pretty early on uh the
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:14.480]   management was insane apparently and their last hq trivia this week was a drunken brawl i didn't
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:19.120]   see wait what i i didn't hear about that he had a farewell episode that involved a considerable
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:26.720]   champagne and cussing oh um that just sounds like old twit um yeah but i mean that's an example of a
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:31.120]   it's an example of like you take an idea that has an explosive amount of like consumer demand
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:35.120]   for it put some capital behind it and then maybe it becomes something it's quite large but it's a
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:42.640]   promise when you have one hit you only have one thing and remember omg pop remember draw something
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.760]   oh yeah they had that big hit it was a fake it was a pictionary clone they had one one app it was
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:52.720]   a huge hit they were smart they got zinga to come along and buy them for a hundred and you guys know
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:58.240]   they got a cap of the guy bye bye they lost all their money just to put a cap on this back to
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:02.320]   daniel there's no point about kind of what's a good fit for vc and kind of where this model fits
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:07.120]   game studios which we're essentially talking about here these kind of app based hits are traditionally
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:13.040]   not considered to be good investments for vcs for this reason right uh and that's why vcs like
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:17.760]   enterprise software which is long enduring revenues and repeatability and so forth um
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:23.600]   he's in the eve of me to have thought that the best thing you can do is have no revenue
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:28.720]   because then the multiple is whatever you want it to be if as soon as you have revenue then people
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:33.680]   say well you're only worth ten times your revenue right so that's that's the case when things are
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:39.520]   incredibly loose and your company's very hot it's a bubble yes yeah so historically there was a
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:48.160]   moment when we're in a bubble um we are in a it's a so it's really weird so the answer is yes
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:53.680]   but not in the two thousand cents it isn't going to be this moment of like implosion and then 10,000
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:58.320]   companies evaporate what's going to happen is there's going to be a slowdown in economic growth
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:02.240]   uh globally it's going to lead to a deceleration in venture capital investing and a lot of companies
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.640]   that were worth a lot of money on paper are going to be forced to really fight for smaller amounts of
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:11.680]   money and lower valuations and that's going to be a a c change they were maybe starting to see in the
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:17.200]   rubble of the vision fund um but i'm a little bit off topic for twit but i mean that's something
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:20.720]   that i'm keeping close eyes on i know you're money guy and we like to have somebody who knows
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:29.200]   about money on once in a while uh and he roobin raised 330 million dollars for essential remember
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:36.080]   and he was the invented android google bottom google fired him google gave him 90 million dollars
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:41.920]   to leave without making any noise uh and he started raised a lot of money because he's got a good
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:49.840]   reputation except with the ladies as a technologist and uh so he raised 330 million dollars got
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:54.240]   valued at a billion dollars because he was going to make the next big thing came out with the essential
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:15:00.880]   phone which i like i like to uh the kit i think it got hurt because the camera crashed
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:05.680]   a lot in the first few months they fixed it but it was too late right also they're going to make
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:11.520]   those little add on a dad arms yeah they just had one i think yeah the little blocks things that
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:17.280]   we're going to like yeah yeah and then uh they were going to do a home automation hub that never
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:24.080]   came out and then they announced this little new gem too which was a weird candy bar is everything
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:28.880]   of like what a phone would be for and then they went under there they're an interesting company i
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:35.520]   think Andy you know he he had he stayed behind the scenes and just done the investment in this and
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:39.840]   let someone else be the front facing of the company i think it would have fared better but like he
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:44.880]   just got ended up getting in the way of the messaging and that's all the stories you know and if you
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:49.680]   criticized him he would block you on twitter and it was just like it was just it was the
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:55.040]   wrong way to run a company you know it's a shame because it did have good ideas but then it also
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:16:00.880]   goes to tell you it's really really hard no matter who you are to come into the smartphone market
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:06.960]   2018 or later and make something that's what it had got it had any other company made it would
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:10.960]   have been a probably a successful phone but you can't afford at least more successful right i don't
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:14.560]   know who would have they only sold i can't remember the number was like 10 000 i was one
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:19.440]   yeah it's something very small thing this reminds me a lot of the small british automaker who like
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:23.600]   starts up in a shed and like builds a cool car but can't compete with like lamborghini and Ferrari
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:27.520]   and BMW you know there's a history of these smaller manufacturers and i think we're seeing that in
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:33.200]   smartphone world um that man is carol shelby no well carol shelby worked out you can still get
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:39.120]   shelby succeeded yes he did put in that va in that weird car that worked but the most most
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:43.360]   small auto manufacturers don't historically and i think we're going to see a super repeating trend
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:47.120]   here and even the smartphone market is so competitive we're seeing other players i think that like
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:55.520]   shami struggles yeah lg hcc are in the mail all right well what about this the judge says tells all
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:02.880]   the state attorneys general in the dc it's okay t-mobile and sprint they're okay because i like
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:09.920]   john ledger no i mean yeah that's true the judge like judge was impressed judge said john will
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:16.240]   keep the prices down we so the reason so the fcc and the ftc they've all approved government's
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:21.760]   approved the sprint t-mobile merger but then there were ten state attorneys general who sued
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:29.120]   saying it's going to kill competition we need more not fewer cell phone companies the judge threw it
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:36.560]   out he ruled in favor of the twenty six billion dollar merger um on tuesday there's still one
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:41.920]   little speed bump the california public utilities commission for some reason they have to approve it
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:51.440]   i don't know why but they do um there were uh i was it is it nylie who wrote uh a kind of scathing
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:56.480]   piece in the it's always new lie when it comes to the that's why i'm just assuming it was nylie
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:03.520]   a scathing piece about the judge and his uh kind of uh how can i use on sprint i could put it
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:11.040]   charitably yeah he he didn't he first of all i said sprints failed a failed a failed i mean it's over
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:17.120]   for sprint anyway we got to let him merge um basically that was it was it nylie i can't say
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:21.520]   yeah it was he says the for let t-mobile by sprint because sprint completely sucks
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:29.360]   i mean that wrong i mean t-mobile and sprint were always sort of the two worst right it was like i
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:35.120]   and i would argue actually t-mobile is the better you know coverage right now but sprints cheap
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:40.960]   you know so there's that um i mean it's not wrong yeah that's not that's a still bad reason he did
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:48.880]   pull out some quotes by the uh judge marrero that made him sound like maybe less than astute uh he
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:54.960]   said adjudication of antitrust disputes virtually turns the judge into a fortune teller deciding
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:19:02.000]   such cases typically calls for a judicial reading of the future who knows says what the future hold
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:10.640]   he says the parties uh conflicting engineering economic and scholarly business models essentially
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:17.760]   cancel each other out as evidence so i can't use that uh he said we he's basically saying we just
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:23.680]   we don't know how can we tell uh what the future history history he's looking history
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:28.720]   they're not going to raise prices why would they yes they are why would they do that
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:33.600]   and furthermore i guess he believed that charlie argan and dish could create a fourth
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:39.200]   cell phone company which something everybody agrees is probably highly unlikely although that
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:47.200]   was yeah that was the plan um no one's forming new companies they're just merging and consolidating
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:52.080]   it's that time's over he says uh the new leadership team at t-mobile john ledger
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:58.720]   instituted an innovative strategy and culture referred to as the uncarrier oh i like that
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:04.240]   so anyway okay can i can ask you guys a question because i just want to make sure that i'm not
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:11.520]   totally insane here um we have four now we have three that's still competition right ish it's
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:16.960]   getting closer to a duopoly okay we're expecting prices to go up innovation to go down and
[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:23.040]   competition to decrease right and history tells us that's pretty much what always happens right so
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:27.280]   we don't need to consult the future mr judge we can just look at the past which is look at the
[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:32.960]   Comcast world future yeah you know and we're still fighting i mean most of us just want these
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:38.720]   companies anyway to be dumb pipes and they're still you know it's better i would say today than
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:45.840]   it was for years ago but it's still not quite there yet will there though daniel you cover this
[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:50.960]   wouldn't well they're will these be good for t-mobile and spring customers like they'll be better
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:56.400]   they'll have better coverage and networks and it'll all be better now possibly yeah i mean it
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:03.440]   could work out i mean it's an interesting position i like said i mean sprint who knows how sprint
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:08.320]   law how much longer they could have persisted that's really what i think i think sprint really was kind
[02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:14.640]   of falling so so i thought sprint was really bad but my my my wife has sprint i guess natural
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:18.960]   how to sprint mobile whatever the hell it is um if i don't bring it over to where i am but it was
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:26.080]   fine t-sprint yeah it's pretty yeah spring could do well sprints fine my mom has sprinted providence
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:30.880]   as well sprints good in providence there i gave her my sprint phone because it was unusable in
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:36.080]   northern California but it's that's the thing if you're in Kansas city sprints great so it's not
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:42.400]   fair to say sprint sucks generally right uh but he molds bad some places right he molds sucks in
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:48.720]   some places yeah i mean it really still depends a lot on that um how sprint has it deal with always
[02:21:48.720 --> 02:21:55.600]   mobile PCs yeah no no that's not any better that's worse you can't get better me if you're
[02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:59.520]   laughing at the the the brick and the pants joke and then make a sperm joke and expect me to be
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:05.440]   the one hand rules are for a mobile sprinty sprinty it is mint mobile i mean it's still the mvn
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:10.160]   o stuff that seems to be doing quite well by repetition and there are even there's us elio there
[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:14.560]   are some small carriers in there boost mobile still around which is bizarre and aren't they owned
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:19.760]   by sprint no yeah i believe what i do somewhere owned by some are mvnos some are owned and then
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:25.760]   there are some independent small yeah carriers out there i think i don't remember what the names
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:30.320]   are that's i mean yeah because i wouldn't use a smaller provider because i'm mission phones are
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:35.120]   mission critical for me but um right i've used 18 team verizon my my adult life and they've both
[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:39.040]   been pretty good so like i you know i'm fine with that but i think they're good because they knew
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:43.760]   there was competition of expensive and that if they well yeah but i mean that's just a cost of life
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:48.240]   now i feel i don't think about that too much but i mean with with commision from below to cement
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:53.600]   their their higher status and the ability to charge higher prices they had to be better and now with
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:57.040]   with less competition in general and play less business model innovation you know call team
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:23:02.640]   over what you will a gimmick or not um i i'm pessimistic about uh the future of this industry
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:06.480]   compared to what it could have done with more competition because i'm a capitalist at heart
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:10.560]   and i think this was a mistake but but there's always that's the internal contradiction of
[02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:15.440]   capitalism of which there's tons of them but everybody wants competition and capitalism but
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:20.800]   if you're a business you don't want competition here your goal is to destroy your competition or
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:26.160]   to absorb them so there's always this weird like tension between these systems where yeah as
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:30.240]   consumers we want to competition if you're at t you're definitely you're not like yeah we should
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:34.560]   have come no you you would if you could put rise in out of business right now at t would do that
[02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:39.520]   and a heartbeat right so please don't do that you reconcile those two things it's it's weird
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:43.440]   well i mean it's it's very it's very clear when you're when you're a upstart you're a capitalist
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:47.680]   when you're incumbent you're a statist and that's again to spend a lot more money on lobby in the
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:50.640]   government as we've seen from the technology industry in the last five or ten years there's
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:55.440]   been a skyrocketing and uh amount of capital spent on on lobbying and building out washing and
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:59.520]   based teams because these companies are now worth a trillion dollars plus and they do not want to have
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:05.840]   uh future regulations bring them down and uh it's it's an under it's an undertold story in tech
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:09.200]   in the last five ten years that i think people should be more attention to because you're not
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:14.800]   wrong um these companies are are our our degree is they uh they're designed to be which is very
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:19.120]   by just dent of the system we live in which is fine clear on a capitalist and then there's speaking
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:26.080]   of capitalists there's the richest man in the world Jeff Bezos who just bought a 165 million
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:35.120]   dollar house in Los Angeles it is the most valuable personal home in the country there he is with his
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:42.560]   his girl pal Lauren Sanchez standing in front of the new fair sigh why is it look terrible though
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:47.520]   can you go to that picture on the video and look at the look at the brickwork around that crappy
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:53.040]   pond they have now it looks like repair that yeah um i don't know if that's i don't know if that's
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:58.960]   a surprise i don't know where this is but to put it in perspective by the way the verge points out
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:03.360]   that it's only one eighth of a percent of his net worth it's like if you made 60 thousand
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:10.560]   dollars a year and you bought a house for 75 bucks and he just sold four billion dollars of
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:16.240]   Amazon stuff so he can fix the brickwork uh he's got a little pocket change for billi because yeah
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:21.360]   billi know that is going to his rocket company you know as well speaking of internet i mean
[02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:27.040]   really the real competition isn't going to be sprint T mobile AT&T or Verizon it's going to be
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:33.120]   SpaceX there you go and uh blue origin as they both put up star length the SpaceX project i don't
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:38.480]   know what blue origins is called they want to have you know gigabit internet everywhere for every
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:42.720]   square inch of the planet and honestly what do you need a cell phone for if you've got gigabit
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:50.000]   internet right yeah that's um that i like this idea but it also seems very complicated there's
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:56.480]   already a lot of space junk up in space oh that space is a big place yeah but not around our orbit
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:02.240]   space space is bigger than then Alex's basement it's got lots of room down there you saw gravity
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:07.440]   when uh yeah that's right something hits you it's bad news yeah you can always tell when
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:12.560]   twit reaches the two and a half hour mark because we get comments like space is big it's big it's
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:19.600]   huge it's unimaginably huge it's um it's giant also can we talk about the graphics on twit the
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:25.200]   spinning gift they sometimes like us you like that's best i i mean kevin king ladies and gentlemen
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:30.720]   our technical director technical director we had decided that we should make karsten produce the
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:36.640]   show and kevin just push buttons randomly and it's worked out quite well i think i'm gonna let you
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:41.360]   guys go there's there's so much more we could talk about but god damn it it's a long show and and
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:48.000]   and we we want people to listen as long as they listen to Alex's show uh 25 minutes that's the case
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.280]   well i think the way people digest twit is uh as you would digest any giant meal spreading it out
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:27:00.640]   throughout the week yeah yeah that wouldn't surprise me no uh you are you are uh considering
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:05.040]   you live in my childhood home i was really hoping you were going to do the show for my old bedroom
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:11.280]   up on up there on the third floor the reason why i'm not up on the the upper floor the house is
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:15.200]   because the Wi-Fi connection is not as good and i did it and it's never good when i was a kid either
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:22.000]   well it didn't exist child but other than that um stringing and i yeah karsten and i did a check
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.200]   of my my Wi-Fi in the office here it's like 400 megabits up and down so that's why i'm oh do you have
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:35.840]   Verizon phios i believe we have Verizon phios but my mom just got it i was so jealous i'm looking
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.960]   at she has an hero so i can look at her bandwidth and the bandwidth test yesterday was 30 megabits
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:47.520]   down two up and she said oh honey i just the guy came in he just connected everything i said oh let's
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:55.040]   see what your bandwidth it 492 megabits down yeah so how much you pay them 40 dollars oh
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:28:02.240]   yeah i've got 400 and change down right now and i'm also live streaming to this at the same time so
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:07.520]   it's pretty fantastic that's why it's not even wired by the way that's why you're not going to use
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:12.080]   skiling for your phone because it requires a dish about 18 inches
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:16.960]   one and it lets you won't wear that on your back it's just it's not going to be a good
