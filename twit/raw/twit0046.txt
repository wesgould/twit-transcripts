[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   (whistling)
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.040]   - All right, three, two, one.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.240]   Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.040]   welcome to another edition of "Twit!"
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.440]   "Twit Number 46" joining us today.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.120]   John C. de Vorac, Alex Lindsey,
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.280]   Roderick Chang, David Prager.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.600]   And I'm Patrick Norton.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.160]   Leo LaPorte is missing an action last scene somewhere
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.120]   between Petaluma and Toronto.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:50.700]   - We've also been sightings in Georgia
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.100]   in the Lower East Side of Manhattan,
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.980]   but we won't get into that.
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.380]   I'm Patrick Norton.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.540]   We're gonna start with guys.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.380]   What's the big story?
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.100]   Is it sitting right behind you, Patrick?
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.740]   - The DOJ, so this is bigger than the DOJ story.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.580]   - I don't you think?
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.420]   - Bigger than the Google--
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.260]   - Tell me the long enough--
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.100]   - It's a number of thousands.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.660]   - Tell the listeners what I'm pointing to.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.540]   - My God, it's a copy of Windows XP running
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.620]   on a Macintosh Mini.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.980]   - On a Macintosh Mini.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.140]   - On a Macintosh Mini.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.620]   - No graphics drivers.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.220]   - It were wireless drivers.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.060]   - It worked.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.900]   - Network drivers.
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.740]   - Yeah, but it worked.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.580]   - But you can turn it on,
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.420]   you can move the mouse around.
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.060]   - But you can play with those native solitaire on it.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.900]   - And you can go into the emulator.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.740]   - And you can go into the emulator.
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.580]   - Yeah.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.860]   - But can you dual boot yet?
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.860]   - Yes, really.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.580]   - No, that dual boot, when you started up,
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.180]   when you, this is using the one that was posted
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.020]   for the 13th-- - The slipstream.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.860]   - The slipstream one.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.820]   So when you started up, you hit page upper, page down,
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.980]   and you go OS 10 or Windows,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.460]   and then you hit enter, and you're in, you're in,
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.300]   you're good to go.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.460]   - You have two partitions on there.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.300]   - Yep.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.460]   - And then you, how's it worked?
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.900]   You manually install each of the operating systems
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.740]   after you've-- - Yeah, and I will admit
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.740]   that I didn't do it.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.260]   Ben Durbin here did it.
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.940]   But that was what we were doing for Mac Break,
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.580]   and he did, he partitioned the drive
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.820]   and then installed each operating system on each.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.820]   - Did you install one first or not?
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.540]   - I think you, I think you installed the OS 10 version first.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.900]   And then, and it's really on that bleeding edge side
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.140]   of things where two hours before, you know,
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.700]   we needed it, they did a new patch to work
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.540]   just with that mini.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.820]   - What you needed for?
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.660]   - The patch?
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.860]   - No, I mean, what did you need to do this for?
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.900]   - Oh, we wanted to see if we could do it
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.980]   while we were shooting Mac Break.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.540]   So we were shooting all day, and we were like,
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.020]   hey, let's see if we can, you know, actually,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.900]   it had just come out the day before,
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.020]   so we wanted to see if we could make it work
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.860]   before the end of the day.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.340]   - So it's using the NT bootloader to swap between?
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.100]   - I don't know what it's using.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.660]   It's using magic.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.020]   So, but it's--
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.220]   - No, I read that most of the work was in configuring
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.220]   the booting part of Windows to function natively
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.860]   with what the architecture is based on what,
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.940]   I guess, the new Pentium processor is doing in the--
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.980]   - Not Pentium, but--
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.740]   - I'm just watching you slowly lose momentum in the 70s.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.740]   - I think that the--
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.020]   (laughing)
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.900]   - Well, one the guy who did the hack, $14,000,
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.500]   like $13,854.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   So, that's pretty exciting.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.420]   - Yeah, I think it's really cool.
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.660]   You know, I think that there's a lot of people who,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.620]   you know, obviously this version isn't--
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.340]   - They don't help pay as legal expenses
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.380]   when the Apple sues him.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.540]   - Well, there's two people right?
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.780]   - That's what apparently this is legal.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.620]   - This is completely legal.
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.620]   - We say apparently.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.620]   - This is that they're keen to keep their anonymity
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.300]   and are known only by the handles, NARF and Blanca.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.580]   - A carf, oh my god.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.940]   - NARF 2006.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.620]   - Okay, that's the demo, that's the old NARF.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.300]   - And the other guy named us after--
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.660]   - This is on the BBC News website.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.660]   - Oh, that place filled with lies.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.300]   And about the price is 7,895 pounds.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.260]   - So, okay, so what do you say, John?
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.220]   Where's the DMCA violation?
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.380]   Where's the lawsuit here?
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.540]   - It depends on whether there's a license agreement
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.100]   when you buy a Macintosh or not.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.540]   When you buy a Macintosh and you open OS X
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.660]   or whatever they wanna call it.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.500]   - How is it?
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.260]   - OS X there was this 10, 10.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.260]   - Or you are agreeing to a shrink wrapped license, right?
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.620]   - Right.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.580]   - Well, in there, there may be something about this.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.980]   - I don't know, I'm not gonna--
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.820]   - Didn't Apple say they're not gonna fight anybody
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.620]   or touch anybody that wants to do it?
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.460]   - Apple said we're not gonna do anything
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.860]   to stop people from putting XP on.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.100]   We're not, you know, it's not something we know.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.540]   - Well, you know why, right?
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.700]   - It's gonna double their market share.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.900]   - Because no, I didn't, because they're gonna do it themselves.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.940]   - I don't wanna, I have to go through this again, John.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.900]   - Hey, just a thought.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.420]   I think it would be, it would be more likely
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.100]   that Apple would find a way to run Windows applications
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.820]   in the OS X operating system than it would be
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.060]   for them to port.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.420]   I mean, you know, to allow Windows, you know,
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.500]   dels to run OS X. - Like it natively run,
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.220]   like virtual PC through.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.260]   - But not like virtual PC, like just run it.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.100]   I mean, I think that was--
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.260]   - Oh, I see without the OS overhead.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.700]   - You just double click on a Windows app
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.820]   and it opens in OS X.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.260]   I think it's more likely that that would happen
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.260]   than Apple's exposing themselves by releasing it to Dell.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.860]   So that's my Apple--
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.700]   - That's his theory.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.620]   - That's my story on adding over and greasing up.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.260]   - So what happens next?
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.900]   You're talking about like certain wireless drivers
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.340]   on a there, certain graphics drivers on it there?
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.980]   - Yeah, the networking drivers are in place.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.820]   They don't have a native video driver for it yet.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.620]   So it's run it as a stock 640 by 480 BGA driver.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.780]   - It doesn't look like 640 by 480 on that thing.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.220]   - The last one I saw, they hadn't had a proper VGA driver.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.220]   - It's pretty good.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.060]   - Or proper driver.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.220]   - Actually, there is no hardware driver for the video.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.820]   So I mean, when you move the window around it,
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.660]   it does the little stutter bit.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.580]   'Cause the CPU's redrawing the screen itself.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.660]   - But I'm fairly sure that's 1024 by 768.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.020]   I'd have to go over and look at that.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.660]   - It doesn't look like, yeah, it looks like this
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.500]   what it looks like.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.340]   - Okay.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.300]   Well, maybe they've gotten something working.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.140]   - But no doom to me on that.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.300]   - Well, I'm a PC user and I want a Mac
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.980]   and I would love to be able to continue using
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.060]   my Windows apps on it.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.740]   I'm sure most people are like running Macs,
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.060]   want to be able to run Windows apps.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.060]   I already have Windows, I just want to be able
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.900]   to run Mac apps.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.700]   - Well, I'm in a situation where there's a hand,
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.140]   I have a PC because there's a handful of programs
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.260]   that I need for visual effects production that are on a PC.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.340]   And I would love to be able to just run them on my G5
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.340]   and whatever the next, my super duo tower,
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.460]   whatever it's gonna be.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.020]   - Oh, that'd be fantastic.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.700]   And I'd get rid of my PC.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.260]   (laughs)
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.580]   So.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.420]   - That'd be awesome.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.140]   - Well, okay, well, I guess that topic died.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.220]   - Someone's saying that Leo might be in Vegas
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.980]   because there's a lot of people there doing the NCA
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.420]   tournament, if anyone cares about that.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.060]   But I thought there's a cool--
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.900]   - Is that like a basketball player?
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.740]   - There's a basketball player.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.020]   But there's a good tech into this.
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.940]   There's a CBS is doing a thing, a lot of people done it,
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.660]   but you can watch every game, VOD,
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.460]   you can go back and watch any game that's already been played,
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.220]   you can watch it all free and there's providing this
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.980]   with the understanding that they're gonna get their costs back
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.420]   as ad revenue.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.900]   And it's, I mean, I think it's really cool.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.300]   You can go back and watch the highlights of any game like that.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.020]   You can go watch any game live as it's happening like that.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.860]   - I wonder--
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.700]   - And they're not charging it down.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.940]   - I wonder what the model is though,
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.700]   because ad revenue is based on viewership.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.700]   And if for, say for example, and they pay in advance,
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.340]   I mean, what, well, say I take out an ad
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.740]   and it's on one of these basketball games.
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.540]   And the next thing you know, there's a 20 million downloads.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.340]   Am I supposed to pay more money?
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.780]   And if I'm not supposed to pay more money,
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.820]   how's CBS making money?
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.660]   - I don't know how they--
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.740]   - I don't know how they roll models.
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.300]   - Yeah, but it's a lot less wacky for the people
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.300]   who are normally advertising on CBS or ESPN
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.660]   than it is for say somebody would be, you know,
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.260]   advertising on this podcast.
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.100]   If you're buying in terms of CPMs,
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.820]   then you're already buying for millions of eyeballs,
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.940]   having a couple million more isn't gonna exactly kill you.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.820]   - No, I mean, yes, but you don't wanna get surprised.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.300]   I mean, you know, people do have budget--
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.900]   - Yeah, but you know, the salespeople are not that stupid.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.900]   - They probably never gonna put it in the contract.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.020]   - Sorry, you repeat that again.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.980]   - Salespeople are not that stupid, neither are the ad buyers.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.740]   They're gonna put a cat in it and they're gonna rotate.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.060]   Yes, they're gonna rotate, you know,
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.460]   they're gonna rotate in on their advertising.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.700]   - Well, when they did the Olympics,
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.100]   they sold, I heard, that they sold ads
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.020]   and they promised a certain number of viewers,
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.980]   but they weren't positive because some of the other networks
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.180]   were ramping up their big shows like Lost and some of those
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.660]   others to really take on the Olympics.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.940]   And so I know that some of these contracts had,
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.620]   we project, you know--
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.540]   - So many--
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.340]   - Seven million viewers for such and such.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.020]   And if we get five or four, we're gonna give you your money back
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.500]   or we'll give you free ad space on our other stuff
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.140]   until we reach what our goal was.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.980]   - They didn't even--
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.900]   - I don't know how they broke it for this,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.420]   but according to the, I don't know what,
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.260]   according to the AFP, they said that the first day
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.780]   of games, they had over 1.2 million internet viewers
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.100]   quoting CBS and then they said they--
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.940]   - Really?
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.380]   - The CBS claimed that they set a new internet record
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.100]   for a live entertainment event of more than 268,000
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.260]   simultaneous streams.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.100]   I don't know.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.940]   - Wasn't live eight figures.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.580]   - They said that that was the biggest and they want to
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.580]   break that or they just broke it, which is AOL's little
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.700]   music portal that did the live eight ones.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.860]   - I don't know if I call it a little music portal.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.860]   - I know.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.340]   - Above and beyond the relationship that Twid has with
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.820]   with AOL distributing the bandwidth,
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.900]   live eight was pretty big.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.500]   Okay, who's seen AOL's television now?
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.860]   Television.aol.com/intoTV.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.700]   - It's cool.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.580]   - Pinky in the brain is back.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.420]   - This is still like--
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.260]   - It is.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.420]   - It's like a bizarre collection of Warner,
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.820]   I guess Warner Brothers shows.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.020]   - Warner Brothers, Alice.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.860]   - Babylon 5, Beetlejuice, Chico and the Man, Dark Justice.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.500]   - Dark Justice was a pretty bad show though.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.380]   - After all the spelking grass loy.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.300]   - Especially in certain episodes of Wonder Woman.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.220]   - With them Nikita, Lois and Clark.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.940]   The new Adventures of Batman.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.740]   - New Adventures of Batman, love it.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.580]   Good.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.740]   - The V, welcome back Carter.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.580]   - The Carter, but I can't even say that.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.980]   - Have you seen that they're gonna release,
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.740]   I think it's 10 episodes of Office
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.060]   that are internet only over the summer?
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.540]   - Is it the British, is it the British,
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.380]   the Office?
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.220]   - I'm not positive.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.460]   - Which one it is.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.860]   But they're gonna put it out over the summer,
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.180]   it's gonna be on, I think it's on NBC's website.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.260]   - Is this 'cause they have too much content to put out
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.580]   or because it's an experiment?
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.420]   - I think it's an experiment.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.980]   - Well Channel 4 in the UK is actually putting out
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.620]   episodes of their kind of technology
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.620]   or IT sitcom called The IT Crowd.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.780]   I'm not sure anyone's watched it.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.620]   - The IT Crowd.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.460]   - The IT Crowd.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.660]   It's funny, I mean in a British way.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.460]   (laughs)
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.340]   - But I think a lot of them are just trying to see
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.700]   if they can generate enough eyeballs
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.260]   to make a self-sustaining revenue.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.300]   - Well I mean when you look at,
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.060]   like selling something on iTunes,
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.380]   the rumor is they're making about a buck 50 per show
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.020]   when people are buying them.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.660]   You know, that Apple's not making much as usual
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.020]   'cause it's just a push for the iPod.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.500]   - Buck 50 to the studios.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.300]   - The buck 50 to the studios, now on average,
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.740]   that's three times as much as that they make on advertising.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.020]   I mean what they're hoping to make is 45 cents,
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.700]   50 cents per viewer, you know, across for advertising.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.100]   And so they're actually doing significantly better.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.140]   I think that they're gonna get to a point
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.500]   where they start releasing more of these shows ahead of time.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.540]   You know more of them, you know, a week early on.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.900]   - It's a sense of viewer?
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.180]   - 50 cents of viewer on the advertising.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.020]   - This seems pretty high to me.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.460]   - That's, you know, I read it.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.460]   It must be, it must be, it's an industry number I read it.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.620]   It must be the truth. - I actually get it.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.460]   That doesn't sound right.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.700]   - Okay, check it out.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.700]   But if it's lower than that, then it's lower than that.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.940]   Then the argument becomes even more intense
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.460]   that they would be more likely if iTunes continues
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.660]   to pick up speed or other online sales.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.860]   They'd be more likely to do--
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.620]   - That's like the advertising rate of $500 to $1,000.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.820]   This doesn't make any mathematical sense.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.380]   - You, as I said, it's--
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.500]   - It's a number that was--
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.140]   - It was the number, I read it in an industry thing.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.660]   So I don't have it right in front of me.
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.420]   I don't have to go look for it.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.540]   - But if it's lower than that, if it's a lot lower than that,
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.620]   then what your, it still makes the point
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.300]   that they're more likely to let you download it
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.180]   and buy it first.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.180]   At least you get that number.
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.380]   - I think there's five cents has gotta be the number.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.820]   - If it's five cents, it's even, it's even,
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.780]   I mean, the bottom one is regardless of whether it's
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.620]   five cents or 50 cents, it is, it is, I mean,
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.020]   that number doesn't make any difference
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.940]   other than it's either three or 30 cents.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.860]   - Right, this is a higher number.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.620]   - It's a much higher number for the download.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.460]   - Yeah, right, right.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.060]   - So about a buck and a half per viewer, although,
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.220]   you know, you could pass it around.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.500]   I mean, if I've downloaded it and then my kid wanted
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.180]   to watch it, there goes the per viewer rate, 75 cents.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.260]   (laughing)
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.220]   And then I cut it half again by handing it over
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.780]   to somebody else or whatever.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.500]   - I guess there's probably, I'm sure,
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.100]   but if those people are gonna do that,
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.580]   they're just as likely to go get it in BitTorrent anyway.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.900]   So you're mostly, you know, I mean, it's, it's, I mean,
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.940]   if they're gonna pass it, once they start breaking the law,
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.460]   the why bother going to iTunes.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.580]   - Once you start breaking it,
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.620]   I'll just go, "What's your real life?"
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.460]   - Once you realize you get everything at higher risk.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.820]   - Does anybody know the, you know, another story
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.580]   that's on the list is, does anybody know the details
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.740]   on this French situation?
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.060]   - Which French, the one where they said, "Okay, you know,
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.060]   "all the MP3 players have to be interoperable,
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.940]   "and Apple's gonna have to open up the iTunes
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.700]   "play back on portables."
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.340]   - Apple's gonna just pull out of the market.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.180]   - Is this because of the French, or is it because
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.820]   of another company that's decided to fight it in France?
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.540]   - Because of a, I think it's a French government initiative.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.380]   - Is it?
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.220]   - Yeah.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.060]   - In fact, they've had a lot of initiatives.
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.860]   I think the most recent, the other most recent
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.260]   kind of newsmaker was the one where they allowed,
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.180]   let's say, peer to peer sharing of media and stuff
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.580]   and not classified as illegal.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.420]   - So are they serving?
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.100]   - Well, there is nothing wrong with peer to peer sharing.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.300]   - No, no, what's your sharing?
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.180]   - You know, exactly, with copyrighted material.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.620]   It was, remember, they wrote it, it was about two months ago.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.300]   They said that it was no one.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.700]   - I'll see if I can look at the story.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.540]   - Yeah, I'll tell.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.700]   (laughing)
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.500]   - It's, well.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.580]   - Yeah, everyone's wanted to grow
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.660]   and because I happen to be plugging in the network
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.820]   because of some recent--
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.660]   - No, I think it's--
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.740]   - Prager and I can't get on the wireless.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.260]   - That sharing of copyrighted material
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.620]   or peer to peer or similar style networks in France
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.060]   is not considered a crime.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.780]   Or rather, it's a bill, it's not.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.100]   - Okay, so what does it--
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.180]   - So let's take a step back.
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.300]   On March 16th, this is a business week
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.140]   and article about this.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.500]   France's National Assembly is expected to vote
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.780]   on legislation known as the author of rights laws
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.660]   amongst its many provisions.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.180]   The bill calls for lightning the punishment
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.980]   on unauthorized downloads of copyrighted music
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.980]   and which is kind of interesting is offenders would go,
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.820]   the fines would drop from $300,000 to 38 euros
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.300]   which is less than $50.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.140]   - Well, that's about right.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.820]   - And the legal sharing would be like a traffic ticket.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.580]   150 euros or about $180.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.420]   - Well, that's kind of high.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.620]   I think it should be like a traffic ticket.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.540]   What's wrong with that?
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.740]   - Well, what's interesting is what if the other thing
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.100]   is the legislation of past would also require vendors
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.860]   to make their music compatible with all media players.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.660]   So that means everybody.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.580]   - So that means all of a sudden you could download
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.940]   the Beatles on the iTunes music.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.660]   - Well, I mean, this is like--
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.780]   - Well, I think they're saying
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.700]   that you couldn't do a vertical integration
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.660]   where you own the software and the delivery as well.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.020]   - It also means you'd have to be able to play WMV on iPods.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.220]   So that wouldn't go both ways.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.380]   There's no way to restrict it
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.300]   or it would kill off all DRM on audio inside of France.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.900]   - Well, I mean, it just, I think the whole thing is,
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.220]   I mean, Apple, Apple's not,
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.100]   I'm sure not even thinking about it.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.660]   I mean, it doesn't-- - Because it's France?
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.740]   - No, it's not Apple, it's Apple.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.460]   It's Microsoft, it's everybody else.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.660]   - And if they have to open that up,
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.180]   the French market isn't big enough for them
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.980]   to change their entire business model for.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.660]   - So the cafeteria and Cupertino,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.140]   they're serving freedom fries?
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.980]   - No, I don't think they--
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.820]   - No, they didn't even bother.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.180]   - I don't think, I don't think they're even upset about it.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.460]   - They did take free stuff for me.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.300]   (laughing)
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.140]   - Oh, by the way.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:33.980]   - It's more dope.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.620]   - Just to zigzag back to the ad revenue,
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.300]   it's per show, not per commercial.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.860]   So you're talking about 30 commercials going across.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.220]   - Oh, okay.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.060]   That's how that goes.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.660]   - Well, let's see, yeah, you'd have--
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.500]   - Then it's then you're talking about a penny.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.660]   - Today's TV is 40 minutes of show
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.820]   and 20 minutes of commercial
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.500]   and each one is going to be--
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.340]   - 40, that's 40 penny a--
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.780]   - 40 penny a--
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.460]   - Right, right.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.620]   - More or less, yeah.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.460]   - So that's the--
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.300]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.660]   - 'Cause there's 40 ads.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.500]   - Right.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.220]   - Or 40, 30 second ads.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.300]   Of course, some of those are house ads and whatever.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.460]   - Uh-huh.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.620]   So you were just sitting there grinding away on this.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.780]   - I was, I couldn't help it.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.220]   - You know, I was not gonna let the Vorek win.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.060]   - No, I just, I knew that the math was wrong.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.340]   I had to figure it out.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.860]   - That was not okay, whatever works.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.260]   - But was the source again?
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.620]   - No, I just did it in my head.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.700]   - I didn't look anywhere.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.860]   - Vorek was like, why is that?
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.140]   - I was not happy on this show.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.540]   - So, yeah.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.740]   - So okay, here's my favorite one.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.660]   This is my favorite story by the way.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.700]   Sights ooze Google over search rankings.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.540]   - Oh, the--
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.020]   - KinderQuest.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.460]   - Can you imagine?
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.340]   - Over search rankings?
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.460]   - Well, they're saying they downgraded.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.260]   - Oh yeah, this is a great story.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.780]   This company, what is the name of them?
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.940]   - KinderQuest.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.420]   - KinderStart.com.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.260]   - Sorry.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.100]   - According to CNN.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.540]   KinderStart.com seeks financial damages
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.100]   along with information on how Google ranks internet sites.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.420]   They apparently, they went down in ranking way down
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.020]   and now they blame Google for lost revenue.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.060]   - Yeah, they said--
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.420]   - And they sued him.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.540]   - They said that they, a cataclysmic 70% fall
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.900]   in its audience resulting in 80% decline in revenue.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.660]   - But this, by the way, is the top story
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.900]   in the davorek.org/blog blog right now as we speak.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.740]   In case you're--
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.580]   - So the worst part is I didn't even know
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.140]   Google ranked anything.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.140]   I mean, I'm sure it does, but I mean,
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:21.980]   I didn't know--
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.020]   - Well, they say that they employ a technology
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.100]   that's based on algorithms that,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.820]   I mean, the most commonly known thing into the public
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.500]   is that however many people link to your stuff,
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.940]   when you search for something, you know,
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.020]   if I have a site about volleyball and everyone links to me
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.380]   when you type in volleyball on Google,
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.220]   you'll probably get my site as one of the top two or three.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.420]   And then I guess they've got a bunch
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.620]   of other underlying things that they don't want to give up
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.060]   which is their intellectual property.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.180]   And I think that's the only reason
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.020]   that this is even maybe construed as half
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.940]   of an interesting story 'cause I could go--
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.020]   - I think it's more than interesting
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.340]   because the fact of the matter is,
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.860]   anyone who does a lot of stuff online knows that Google
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.860]   probably provides at least 50% of all their hits,
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.940]   all the page views.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.900]   I mean, at least my blog, which gets about,
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.220]   I don't know, I'm getting about 60,000 people,
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.780]   or 60,000 page views a day, which is reasonable for a blog.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.620]   - But you know what else is funny?
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.860]   - They're all half of them from Google.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.420]   - This company's called Kinderstart,
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.820]   and they say when you type in Kinderstart in a search engine
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.700]   on Yahoo or someone else or MSN,
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.500]   ours is the top site, but how many people
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.460]   are looking for a site that caters to what they're doing
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.020]   and they type in Kinderstart?
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.540]   - Why don't they just go Kinderstart.com?
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.340]   - 'Cause I would think that you'd figure out that,
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.580]   but they're basing it on search engine.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.500]   - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.900]   - Kinderstart's a search engine,
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.820]   which makes it more interesting.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.620]   Why should Google put another search engine
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.460]   on any of their results?
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.300]   - Well, clearly some kinders are just saying.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.900]   - What Kindercard is saying is that Google modified
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.500]   the ratings so that they basically made
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.220]   Kinderstart disappear.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.700]   - I think that's actually probably true.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.540]   - Why?
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.380]   Why would it be true?
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.020]   - Well, all this sudden, if you type in Kinderstart
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.580]   on Google, you get like Kinderstart.co.uk,
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.940]   you go to any other web browser,
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.900]   it takes you to Kinderstart.com.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.940]   Maybe there's some weird anomaly in their algorithm,
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.740]   but it seems like something just happened.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.860]   - They can start UK folks.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.380]   - Now, the other thing is, why the hell?
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.380]   Why the hell does Google give a flipping end?
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.100]   - They don't, that's the other thing, yeah.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.060]   - Why would they care?
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.060]   - Well, in some cases, they, I think they have.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.500]   That's what a lot of people do.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.740]   - The other thing is, Google says that they type it.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.060]   - Google says that they type it's a myth.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.700]   - I don't, I mean, if somebody can come up
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.140]   with some concrete evidence that Google's playing games.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.980]   - I don't know.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.300]   - I think it would be great, but no one's gonna,
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   you're not, it's not gonna happen.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.060]   - The only reason I've heard of Google playing games
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.660]   with the way people's stuff is ranked
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.180]   is if they are trying to take advantage
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.300]   of the way their page rank system works.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.860]   If someone's trying to like quote unquote hack their systems
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.340]   so they get a good guess, then Google say,
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.740]   hey, you're out, you're out, I think.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.740]   - No, there's been evidence of that,
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.740]   there's a good reason.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.020]   - So that maybe, maybe was Kinderstart
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.900]   maybe tweaking with some stuff and then, I don't know.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.860]   - I don't know.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.060]   But nobody knows, we'll find out in court.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.900]   (laughs)
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.340]   Anyway, I think this is a bad precedent
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.340]   if this actually gets anywhere.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.460]   Because you can't, you start suing this search engine
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.580]   companies and where, you know, these guys might as well
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.660]   just pull up their tents.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.620]   You can't, I mean, they won't be able to do anything.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.380]   It's gonna just cripple them.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.020]   - Well, I just think it's, I guess I just think it's absurd.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.380]   - I mean, you know, they're doing whatever they're doing.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.380]   You're happy that they're there.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.780]   I mean, if you're, you don't have a contract
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.700]   with those search countries.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.540]   - They're not getting these.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.860]   - They don't, they don't, they didn't promise you anything.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.140]   You know, they can do what, you know, I mean,
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.980]   you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know,
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.820]   - That's free advertising.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.660]   These guys are having a problem,
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.500]   why don't they just take out an ad?
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.340]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.260]   I like what the lawyer for Kinderstart says is like,
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.980]   they hope to prove Google is the associated press article.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.340]   - That hopes to prove Google has become an essential
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.140]   facility that should be required to warn websites
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.780]   before dropping them from the index.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.860]   We don't really feel that there is enough transparency
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.300]   in openness in a service that has become so important.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.140]   - Like Kinderstart.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.140]   - So who is this person?
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.700]   - That's the lawyer for Kinderstart.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.340]   - This lawyer guy or a woman sounds a little flaky.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.620]   - Lawyer guy or woman.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.380]   - I bet you Kinderstart has a lot more traffic now
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.020]   than it did before Google met.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.420]   - Yeah, actually they're making hay with this lawsuit.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.500]   Another one of those suits that gets your publicity.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.980]   - Speaking of which, department does,
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.780]   D.O.J. and the judge sells the D.O.J.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.460]   that Google doesn't have to turn over the gigantic number
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.180]   like the billions of URLs in search requests.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.140]   The judge has said instead of two months worth
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   of user search queries, they get 50,000
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.460]   and Google has agreed to comply with that.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.180]   - So that's kind of the most recent 50,000.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.780]   - I don't know if it's the most recent
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.500]   or if it's a select 50,000.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.820]   - Cherry Pickham.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.980]   - It's a phishing expedition, whatever it is.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.100]   - Well, the federal government's trying to pull together
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.460]   proof that COPO should be,
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.260]   COPO which has been struck down in more ways than one,
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.780]   should be reinstated.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.340]   - Here's another story that's kind of interesting to me.
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.220]   Australian IT, this is not apparently in the magazine,
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.860]   Australian IT.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.380]   Apparently licenses might be required for IPTV,
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.860]   according to the government, it's floated the idea
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.980]   of forcing internet providers to apply for licenses
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.260]   to offer web-based TV services.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.460]   - You mean in Australia?
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.900]   - Yeah, what do you think of that, Alex?
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.980]   - Say that again.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.220]   - What's the definition of a web-based--
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.700]   - He's still doing the math on this.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.540]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.620]   - Australia government has floated the idea
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.300]   of forcing internet providers to apply for licenses
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.660]   to offer web-based TV services.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.420]   In other words, IPTV.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.580]   In other words, you now--
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.420]   - But how do you--
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.700]   - Now you have to be like a broadcasting license
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.580]   to send a crappy video or something across the--
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.580]   - So of course the question's gonna come up is,
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.620]   when you do that, does that mean that anybody
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.540]   who broadcasts on the web, do they have to come to Australia
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.380]   and get a license?
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.020]   'Cause like can I broadcast over the web
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.900]   from the United States?
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.020]   And if so, then all the people who are making web TV
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.180]   are just gonna move out of Australia.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.100]   I mean, they'll put their server in Vanuatu
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:46.940]   and call it a day.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.580]   - Well you do have an account on YouTube
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.340]   and upload a video.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.660]   - The bottom line is, they'll just move their server.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.300]   I mean, I'm sure it makes sense to some politician
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.140]   in their Kukukukuk.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.140]   - He does understand it.
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.420]   - Yeah, who has no idea what they're--
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.620]   - Yeah, we will write your license.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.460]   - Well, what one thing--
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.300]   - It makes a lot of sense to a politician
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.380]   that's been poked with a sharp stick
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.860]   and a bag full of money by lobbyists.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.700]   - Totally.
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.540]   - But why?
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.380]   - But the lobbyists would not--
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.820]   - What lobby would want this?
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.540]   - Except to move traditional broadcasters.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.860]   - Oh yeah, what do they have to protect?
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.700]   - You're right, right.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.540]   - This is like Bell South.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.500]   Why would Bell South wanna throttle back,
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.100]   make money on traffic going both ways?
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.060]   Well, because they wanna make more money
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.860]   or because they see their traditional--
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.020]   - They're sharing the dirty stuff.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.420]   - Yeah, they don't wanna change their business models
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.700]   under any circumstances.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.900]   - Well, I think a lot of the,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.540]   I mean, whether it's the RIAA or the broadcasters,
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.780]   what they wanna do is they wanna slow the movement down
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.820]   so they can try to figure out some way to catch up.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.260]   You know, so they wanna have something,
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.700]   whether it works or not,
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.220]   they wanna slow the process down
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.020]   so that they can figure out how to--
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.260]   - I mean, there's stuff similar, I mean,
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.700]   even outside of traditional just technology,
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.500]   I mean, even, for example, with airlines,
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.220]   I think, Qantas wanna reprieve from the Australian government
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.540]   to have Singapore Airlines fly the US,
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.340]   Australia flight route, just because, you know,
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.540]   they wanna keep that market share to themselves.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.340]   So, I mean, similar is the same thing.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.540]   I mean, you have a state broadcaster, ABC,
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.820]   and you also have the three other channels
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.180]   that exist in Australia?
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.420]   - Well, I don't know.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.620]   Let me say that's like, you know,
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.860]   there's two ways of looking at it.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.580]   There's that they're trying to have online programmers
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.940]   follow the same set of rules
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.260]   that traditional broadcasters have to apply,
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.700]   you know, have to follow.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.060]   And I don't know, it's, it's,
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.460]   it's some pretty funny quotes on Australia about it too.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.580]   - It's, I don't know, I would not wanna get litigated
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.020]   in Australia.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.020]   It's pretty random, pretty harsh.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.420]   - You wanna get arrested in a shade?
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.460]   - Well, I don't have to piss off the Aussies.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.460]   You're over there.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:45.100]   - Speaking of regulation, you, the XXX is back, John.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.940]   - Yeah, good news.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.100]   Yeah, yeah, XXX is something that was,
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.060]   you know, I actually wrote about this almost 10 years ago
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.500]   and thinking it was a good idea
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.140]   because it was segment things and people, you know,
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.540]   although, you know, there's a bunch of characters came along,
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.700]   many of them Christian conservatives
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.860]   who thought that it would just legitimatize
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.860]   or I don't know what they were thinking to be honest about it,
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.180]   but there was one group in particular
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.100]   I wrote about it in PC Magazine.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.180]   They gave me an award by the way,
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.860]   these women's group or women Christians
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.460]   for Americans of the year or something.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.260]   - Yeah, some jerk off of the year or something like that.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.420]   - No pun intended.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.540]   - And I got like, but I was in good company
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.060]   that everybody else on the list apparently was,
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.420]   you know, they were normal people.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.660]   But anyway, it looks like it's back in play
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.220]   and I think, I still think it's a good idea.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.980]   I don't know, does anybody see why it's not a good idea?
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.100]   - Well, I think it's a great idea.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.580]   Then you also, what's funny is, is that on both sides,
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.460]   the Christian coalition or whoever's, you know,
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.500]   pushing like a look it up,
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.980]   they should be thinking about, you know,
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.340]   the fact that the porn industry is trying to fight it as well
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.580]   because they don't want to be segmented
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.260]   and the ACLU is saying that--
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.100]   - Yeah, but they're in the porn industry.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.100]   That's what's so weird about it.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.860]   - Yeah, so, you know, they shouldn't be pushed
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.140]   into a certain, you know, quote unquote online red light area.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.260]   But I think it makes a lot of sense.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.740]   I think it makes it a lot easier to, you know--
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.380]   - Find the stuff.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.500]   - Well, it makes it easier to--
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.580]   - It doesn't make, it doesn't make--
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.620]   - You just don't have to have a,
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.540]   you just can't take in, you know, anything.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.420]   - Dot exxx.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.020]   - Dot exxx, but this--
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.540]   - I think that it doesn't make it any easier
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.380]   than it is already.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.620]   I think that what it does do is it allows you to apply,
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.340]   you know, for filter systems, for your kids,
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.540]   or for whatever, it makes it really simple.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.180]   - If it actually works.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.460]   - Well, it won't work in the beginning.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.300]   - It pulls all of the--
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.180]   - This is a group called Concerned Women for America.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.180]   And they're the ones who made a big stink about,
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.020]   they're the ones who forced icon to drop the idea.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.820]   You know, the icon basically caved with these women,
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.580]   which is one of these pressure groups.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.820]   I mean, I think that what would happen is--
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.100]   - Three women, I like the way you phrased it.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.780]   - Well, it's well, Concerned Women for America
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.860]   is a name of it.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.980]   So they are women.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.980]   - I think what you probably also see is that
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.060]   if, and I think this is what the porn industry's worried about,
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.060]   is that if you really were able to effectively get
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.100]   not all of it, but 90, 95% of the sites into XX,
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.620]   there would be ISPs whose entire business model
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.060]   was based on, we block it at the server.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.900]   - Right.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.740]   - You know, we-- - You don't have to worry
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.580]   about it at home.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.420]   - Great.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.580]   I won't be buying it from them.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.420]   (laughing)
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.060]   - I'm people who get their access.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.580]   - I wouldn't bother you.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.420]   - Well, yeah, I don't have any--
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.340]   - Yeah, they could probably filter.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.820]   - And you still gotta get a broadcast
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.660]   that's only a little bit of a chill--
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.500]   - I've used to be a little bit of a chilli--
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.820]   - That is, any prior--
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.780]   - The house of Stevie and-- - No, but you Patrick,
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.380]   even thanks to that.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.380]   - For some reason.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.500]   (laughing)
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.380]   - Whether any of us would or not,
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.700]   there's a lot of, you know, if I had kids at home
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.660]   that are, you know, I would definitely--
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.300]   - No, I don't know.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.140]   - I don't know.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.580]   The last time I checked, any 13 year old
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.380]   and the rabid throws of all those 13 year olds.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.740]   - Well, who happened to be confronted
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.540]   with something that they didn't ask a lot of--
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.380]   - Well, great.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.380]   Did all we gotta do is shut down email,
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.100]   'cause think of all the crap that comes over email.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.740]   - Not on my, well, not on yours.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.740]   - I don't get spam.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.820]   (laughing)
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.780]   - The party just being gonna make the same amount of money
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.860]   the same supply and demand is gonna be there
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.860]   is not gonna change.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.140]   - I'm not even saying that, but I'm saying it's like,
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.900]   okay, that would be one said,
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.940]   if there's a child at home,
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.620]   if they're forcing into a triple X domain
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.300]   and you can filter that out, that's okay.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.980]   So that's, okay, then you have to basically push everybody else
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.540]   on the planet off of the dot coms and the dot nets.
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.140]   And assuming if you can figure out a legal way
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.980]   to do that without--
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.820]   - Yeah, I was not even--
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.140]   - I'm not gonna get back and forth this spring forward.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:23.980]   - No, this is the next thing.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:24.820]   - And the next thing is to figure out
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.340]   how to clean out all the email spam.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.780]   And then the next thing we gotta do--
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.620]   - I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.020]   - Is we go after the double on Tondras.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.100]   And the next thing we do is we go over cable television
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.940]   broadcast television.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.780]   - On television.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.700]   - Well, am I not?
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.540]   At what point, Emia, what point is it?
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.220]   Softcore porn is a hardcore porn?
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.180]   Is it all Korean sexual context?
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.020]   - So you just think should be,
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:41.860]   everything should be pulled.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.380]   - I think we should go back to 1950.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.620]   Oh yeah, that's me.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.540]   - They gotta take David, I'm gonna lose me.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.180]   - But if you're watching cable television after--
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.180]   - I'm talking cable television after--
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.180]   - Hey, we're not talking about double on Tondras.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.180]   We're talking about triple X websites
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.460]   and maybe pushing these people over there over time.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.260]   - But no, they're not gonna rush over there.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.100]   - But I think it would be--
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.660]   - And they'd be crazy if they did.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.860]   - Yeah, just, I don't know.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.580]   Is it a nice idea, sure.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.820]   Should we have a triple X domain?
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.660]   Absolutely.
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.060]   Is anybody gonna give up their large profitable business
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.780]   on a dot-com domain to get forced in the--
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.580]   - Hey, you know what to start, that's the way I see it.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.180]   It's better than sitting on your ass doing nothing.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.180]   Which is essentially what's been going on.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.340]   - What?
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.180]   - What is that?
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.660]   - That's your better credit, the other state.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.940]   - It's in the can.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.620]   - Ah, whatever.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.980]   - We're talking about PlayStation 3.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.260]   - Yeah.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.380]   - No PlayStation 3, until at least,
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.260]   until at least November.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.860]   - But when it comes, it's gonna come with a 60 gig hard drive.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.700]   - So when it comes--
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.820]   - Xbox, everyone says it's gonna be,
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.940]   a lot of people say it's supposed to,
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.340]   it's gonna be better than PlayStation.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.140]   I mean, then Xbox, it's gonna outsell Xbox.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.620]   Xbox is getting one hell of a headstock.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.420]   - Three letters, fair.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.900]   - And a lot of people say the Xbox is really well designed
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.220]   and then, you know--
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.380]   - Nobody seemed to actually program games for it
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.220]   as the room.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.060]   - I like the Xbox.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.900]   - For the PS3 or the--
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.460]   - So the story is they're holding off on the release
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.220]   because they're not ready with Blu-ray yet.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.060]   - It's that way.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.060]   - That's not the story I heard.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.820]   - I heard, I heard.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.260]   - I hear that they're dealing with--
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.820]   - The Blu-ray is the lack of,
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.020]   the Blu-ray issues are convenient smoke screen
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.180]   for the incredible problems people are having.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.020]   Writing for the cell processor.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.500]   That Sony learned absolutely nothing
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.940]   about the programming debacle for the PS2
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.380]   and they did the same exact things
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.220]   that are developer based with the PS3.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.940]   - I'm not flabbergasted by any means.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.780]   - I don't know, I mean--
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.540]   - But there's also rumors that they're trying to push it back
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.940]   until they can kind of reduce the amount of cost per unit
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.420]   to an acceptable level so that people can--
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.420]   - Well, it's interesting, they're saying
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.220]   the Blu-ray drives are gonna be out what June or July,
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.660]   Blu-ray drives for computers.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.500]   - Is this later than the cheapest?
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.500]   - It's supposed to be the first one I forget.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.900]   - I hear that Sony's gonna be releasing
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.900]   the same as HD DVD.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.340]   - We're talking about consumer electronics,
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.900]   standalone players, I'm talking about
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.340]   in like, brightable, burnable--
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.340]   - The meetings.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.780]   - The rate this are gonna be available.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.500]   Not too far, what is it, hold on.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.060]   - I think I have this story so much.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.420]   - Dret, where is it, July?
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.620]   $1,000 for the next generation DVD drives for computers
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.620]   for be about $1,000.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.980]   The Sony Vio PC with a Blu-ray drive for about 2,300.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.820]   So, and that's pretty cool actually,
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.060]   they'll have 25 gigabytes.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.660]   - So, what do we think, does anybody, who wanted to,
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.620]   let's take a poll, how many people think Blu-ray
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.500]   is gonna be HD DVD?
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.380]   - I have no idea.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.180]   I think they're gonna be battling still a bit longer.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.980]   There's movie titles coming out from Sony for Blu-ray
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.700]   and there are movie titles coming out by,
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.700]   who's the company that's having HD DVD?
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.980]   - Warner Brothers delayed, is delayed indefinitely,
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.220]   it's launched from the HD.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.180]   Two-sheba's gonna deliver HD DVD consumer electronics
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.660]   players with no movies in the channel.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.340]   - 'Cause I hear rumors that there will be movies on Blu-ray,
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.660]   maybe there's common knowledge.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.460]   - I mean, starting in May, they're releasing titles.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.540]   - So, that's what, May 23rd is the launch date for Blu-ray
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.420]   and they've got like eight titles,
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.260]   most of them are Sony titles coming out on Blu-ray.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.820]   They were supposed to, I guess to the end of March,
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.260]   was supposed to be the launch date for HD DVD
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.580]   consumer electronics players.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.580]   Warner Brothers is pulled out indefinitely on the launch date.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.940]   The Warner's was supposed to have the disc for HD DVD
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.420]   and they have been delayed indefinitely.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.700]   At least that was the word last week.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.420]   - I still think all of this is gonna build up to the fact
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.180]   that by the time they, one of them wins,
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.380]   all we're gonna be doing is downloading them anyway.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.460]   - You know, it's, well, it's pretty big files.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.820]   - Yeah, and they're big files in there and we--
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.500]   - And USA with our crappy bandwidth,
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.100]   I don't see that happening anytime soon.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.140]   - Well, but you have Verizon starting to experiment
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.900]   with small towns doing fiber where you're getting
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.340]   a thousand times the speed of DSL.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.980]   - Yeah, they do a lot of experimenting
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.300]   and nothing comes of it.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.980]   - Well, they have, I think they have a vested interest
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.740]   in having those high speed lines go
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.660]   because what they wanna do is deliver those movies.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.180]   They wanna bypass the HD market.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.420]   They wanna do all those things
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.340]   and there's a lot of money there for them to do it
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.700]   and they're trying to find a way to get beyond just
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.740]   you paying for the connection.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.140]   They gotta have you start buying stuff
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.540]   or they're not gonna survive.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.580]   And so, and the way to get you start buying it,
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.740]   if you look at Seoul, Korea, you know, I mean,
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.780]   you know, South Korea, you're seeing people buy out,
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.660]   spend a lot of money on a lot of stuff online
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.520]   because it is screaming fast.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.540]   - Well, Kuduragi, the guy,
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.420]   the big guy in charge of PS3 or one of them,
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.700]   he specifically said that it's being delayed,
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.180]   pushed back because of delays in developing
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.100]   copyright protection technology for Blu-ray,
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.540]   which has an additional layer of copy protection
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.780]   and that and other technical problems
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:16.620]   for the reason.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.980]   - Well, actually, if you think about the timeline here,
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.500]   Patrick's argument makes more sense
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.460]   because if they're gonna bring out the DVD consumer player,
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.580]   they should have these issues resolved already.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.860]   They're not gonna be resolved, I mean,
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.660]   if they're not resolved by the time they roll out
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.780]   the commercial product, they're not gonna be further
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.460]   resolved in November.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.300]   - I don't know.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.140]   - I think there's something--
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.500]   - I think those things are coming.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.780]   - I've heard this through a second person,
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.540]   but when the original PlayStation launched,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.020]   I guess the original unit cost for those things
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:50.340]   was close to $900 each unit.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.020]   That was, they were suddenly, I think,
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.300]   at the time retail 300, so I mean, they were taking--
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.780]   - Well, this New York Times article says and thinks
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.300]   that Sony might be buying time to bring down
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.340]   the production of half of these components
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.260]   and that they, analysts say Sony would probably try
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.460]   to sell the PS3 for about 500 bucks,
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.380]   which is, and then when the PS2 came out,
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.220]   it was $300.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.060]   - And they're also--
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.420]   - Which is still what, $100 more than the Xbox 360?
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.540]   - They're also the PIM's on IBM
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.620]   on delivering enough processors.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.420]   - A large complicated processor.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.260]   - Yes.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.660]   And who else, I think, costs of the Rambus, right?
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.260]   They don't build that in-house, they buy it
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.700]   from a third-party source.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.300]   - This is a strange story in the register
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.060]   about HD DVD coming out with a region-free version
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:35.900]   in Europe.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.180]   Did anybody see that?
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.540]   - Yes, because all the movies that you do want to watch
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.140]   and don't come from there.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.380]   (laughing)
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.100]   - That's not--
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.580]   - Oh, I know, something's gonna send me a--
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.420]   - I don't know, I don't know.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.260]   - I don't wanna send you anything.
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.140]   - So this PS3's now gonna include a 60 gigabyte drive,
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.180]   which apparently they announced last week.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.020]   - Woo-hoo!
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.660]   - Should be plenty.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.900]   - Yeah, well, good.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.060]   - So we can play gradually.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.060]   - I think Linux as well, right?
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.220]   - Yeah, Linux operating software and the ability
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.620]   to handle high-speed internet, well, duh, of course.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.420]   - Yeah, it's supposed to also be a broad-side router.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.260]   - I'm just reading the thing, of course.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.100]   - Hold on, hold on.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.300]   It's not Warner Brothers has delayed,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.500]   and so they've only delayed the HD DVD releases
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.740]   to mid to April.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.380]   Three films in HD DVD format, April 18,
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.540]   and additional 17 that are following weeks
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.500]   instead of releasing 50.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.340]   - Why are the HD--
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.020]   - One of the first three.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:25.860]   - Doesn't say.
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.940]   - Why are the HD DVD players less expensive,
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.940]   it seems like when they come out,
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.460]   they're gonna be retailing for less money
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.300]   than the Blu-ray.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.340]   - They're gonna lose money, that's why.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.180]   - They're just a marketing scheme.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.020]   - Oh, really?
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.900]   And then of course, if this PS3 is out,
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.820]   that Blu-ray player that it has in it
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.860]   is only less than, it's $500 then,
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.620]   and you get the rest of the computer
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.260]   that comes in the PS3.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.100]   - Right?
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.540]   - I guess that's what their Sony's hedging their bet on.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.980]   - I mean, if there were a lot of movie titles
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.980]   and I don't care about playing games,
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.660]   I'd still buy the PS3 if there were a lot of Blu-ray titles
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   and I could watch them on that thing.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.500]   I'd buy it, independent of it being a video game player.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.540]   - Well, it also depends on how much they street for.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.540]   It's street for $600, you're still gonna be so hot to buy one.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.660]   - Yeah, because if I wanted a Blu-ray player
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.140]   is he halfway interested in the Blu-ray.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.460]   - They'll be on the second--
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.300]   - They'll be on the second--
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.220]   - One year and the Blu-ray players will be $399.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.140]   - They'll be $399 by Christmas.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.500]   - Yeah, that's probably, they're maybe--
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.860]   - There's gonna be more, there's gonna be more--
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.580]   - Okay, you're right, I'm not gonna buy it
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.420]   on the first time soon.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.260]   - By Black Friday.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.100]   - I'll be excited to have Blu-ray players.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.220]   - Well, because when DVDs came out,
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.620]   how much cooler were DVDs than renting a DVD movie
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.460]   than a VHS?
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.380]   - That's because you're looking
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.780]   at a part of the country where they actually had
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.620]   these for rent. - And I think this is
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.620]   gonna be bigger, I don't care if it's HD DVD or Blu-ray,
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.980]   it's gonna be a bigger difference
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.420]   watching these high-definition--
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.780]   - Do you have an HD TV that was--
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.620]   - Do you have an HD TV?
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.540]   - Do you have an HD TV?
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.420]   - Depends on more story.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.860]   - Right now, I don't, but I'm saying like, yeah,
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.780]   it takes more components to do it,
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.780]   but I think the difference in watching--
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.860]   - Honestly, I think most of this country
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.620]   is probably gonna sit on their ass
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.620]   when that stuff comes out,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.860]   'cause people don't wanna, I mean,
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.300]   that's a large chunk of change to upgrade
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.700]   your home theater, especially if you know--
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.260]   - We got a couple thousand for a TV,
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.300]   we got 500 to a thousand for an HD DVD.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.820]   - I mean, it's just expensive, I mean, you know,
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.460]   I think people would rather spend their money
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.940]   on things like that count, like electricity--
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.940]   - God, you really get to spend--
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.140]   - How are you doing? - To food, to food,
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.500]   to boot like these movies.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.700]   - Car, with enough guys--
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.780]   - Mortgage payments.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.820]   - Mortgage payments, alimony, you know.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.660]   - Oh, it's amazing, they're selling a huge number of--
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.500]   - Alimony?
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.340]   - Huge number of--
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.180]   - Alimony.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.740]   - Of HD televisions are being sold.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.020]   - I think anybody wants to spend their money on alimony.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.220]   - No one wants to, but the good source is you.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.460]   - Roger's still dealing with all those child support payments.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.380]   - Ah, so long ago.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.740]   (laughing)
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.940]   - In depressing news, the team that built Katamari Damasi,
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.940]   the heart Katamari, and my, my, Katamari has dissolved.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.060]   - You know, I never--
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.660]   - There will be no sequels to the games.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.980]   - I never realized this until I went to Chicago
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.740]   to do a thing for a game spot at the,
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:52.980]   you know, it was at the Museum of Science and Industry,
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.060]   they had a little traveling video game exhibit,
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.820]   that Katamari Damasi was actually created
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.260]   as kind of a college project.
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.820]   It wasn't, you know, initially designed
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.060]   as a commercial product, but it became such a hit
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.180]   that they published it as such and made a couple of sequels.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.700]   - That's how Apple started, you know.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.500]   - Yeah, it was just a couple of guys screwing around.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.660]   One guy screwing on another guy, going to other people.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.180]   - Hey, you want to buy this, right?
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.620]   - That's how Microsoft started.
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.880]   (laughing)
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.180]   - That's how the podcast started.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.100]   - Okay. (laughing)
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.460]   Yahoo launches local news.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.300]   - What?
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.620]   - Yep, cool.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.540]   - Where are they gonna get their feeds from?
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.700]   - That's a really good question.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.540]   - Where'd that start?
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.340]   I didn't see that story.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.180]   - That's good.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.100]   - Ooh, I wonder if the Guardian.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.020]   Location specific URLs.
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.180]   - So you could go anywhere
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.620]   and just look at the local news group.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.860]   - Unfortunately, for some reason,
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.020]   I'm getting Madison area news.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:46.860]   Let me change my location.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.380]   - Madison, Wisconsin.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.660]   - Apparently, hold on, I'm changing my location now.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.500]   - Where did you take us out?
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.220]   - I'm here with this little kid that quote unquote,
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.700]   hacked the news.google.com
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.100]   by figuring out how they tried to aggregate press releases
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.940]   and he created a press release that said,
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.860]   I'm the youngest employee hired by Google
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.420]   and he made it very official speak
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.780]   and made quotes by--
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.900]   - The official speak.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.740]   - You know.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.580]   - It's like new speech.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.700]   - Then you gotta leave quotes from the CEO
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.860]   and the CTO and someone.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.700]   - Right, it's all standard.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.380]   - And all of a sudden it gets picked up by Google News
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.540]   as a press release and they start feeling stuff
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.580]   and Google didn't quite know at first it.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.340]   It's the best of my knowledge.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.340]   Whether or not it was true
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.540]   and this kid starts getting calls.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.020]   - Yeah, that story came out.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.860]   - It was awesome.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.700]   - It was pretty funny.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.860]   - We'll pay you three times as much.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.420]   - That kid is a marketing genius.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.220]   We should track him down and use him for something.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.620]   - The Kinder website should have hired him.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.940]   - No, he's too.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.300]   - That's the thing, they solve all their problems.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.340]   Yeah, whose local news,
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.260]   they list basically stories from the local newspapers.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.140]   - Not much of a big deal.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.100]   - No, it's kind of cool if you want like your area stuff.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.580]   - I wanna know what happened on my show.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.420]   - Of course you get to get to the end.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.700]   - So you know, Google bought rightly,
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.380]   which is that online word processor
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.620]   we talked about on the show some weeks ago.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.140]   And now it looks like their next target
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.540]   probably is gonna be an online spreadsheet
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.220]   and there's a couple out there already.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.060]   - I'm trying to think,
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.580]   who are the people that did the Java based
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.980]   office suite that never come like the year?
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.220]   - Oh wow, that's pretty good.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.060]   - It's pretty good.
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.260]   I know that, I don't know,
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.740]   I mean, I know that at one time,
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.580]   Corellic's right.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.220]   - The Patrick's start typing seriously.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.100]   - I don't have the internet, but the hell.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.100]   (laughing)
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.180]   - Oh, you know it's too bad.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.300]   (laughing)
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.580]   I thought you were set up.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.700]   - And is anybody excited about the next generation
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.220]   office quite the beta?
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.260]   - You know what I think is,
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.980]   I think it's his machine that was interfering with it.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.540]   He's got something wrong with his.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.020]   - Well, I can connect to his via infrared
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.860]   and hacking into his head out.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.180]   - This is just leaking, you know,
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.020]   good rating.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.100]   - Still lowest, MP3's.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.660]   I rose is the one that seems to be a fairly decent one.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.500]   I rose.com.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.380]   - I have an open review.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.060]   - That's not Irish Rose Consulting, is it?
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:51.900]   - So do you have to be online
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.380]   to access your documents then?
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.380]   - Well, of course, I haven't played with this one,
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.460]   but it seems as though they have some sort of
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.380]   an offline thing you can do.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.900]   - Do I get to download component?
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.420]   - Yes, it's not iros.com.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.580]   - I-W-R-O-S, R-R-O-W-I-R-O-W-S.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.140]   - I-R-O-S.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.980]   - I-R-O-S.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.820]   - I-R-O.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.660]   - I-R-O.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.740]   - Irish Rose Consulting is iros.com.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.740]   - Who needs this to be?
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.860]   - Who needs this stuff, people that use dumb terminals?
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.180]   - No, it's not, it's iros.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.620]   iros, data manning.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.540]   - 'Cause I'm Rose Family.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.820]   - I know, but when you said that originally,
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.860]   I thought you said rose R-O-S-E.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.780]   - Oh, I see, yeah.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.980]   - By any other name would smell just as sweet.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.700]   - I like doing stuff online,
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.260]   but I mean, I'll just use OpenOffice
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.900]   and archive this stuff on an online drive
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.340]   if I want to access it somewhere else.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.740]   Why use a spreadsheet online?
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.140]   - I think that's what people say.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.620]   They say it's crazy.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.380]   - Well, we start talking about online office.
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.380]   I mean, this gets back into this judge orders
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.980]   Gmail disclosure.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.980]   So in a lawsuit brought by the federal trade
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.820]   admin, this is on CNET,
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.380]   by the FTC, a subpoena is sent to Google
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.700]   for the complete contents of a Gmail account,
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.580]   including deleted email messages.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.660]   This is unrelated to the subpoena
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.940]   that Google had for the other stuff.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.900]   So this is, we want your Gmail,
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.100]   even the, 'cause you don't know when,
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.780]   if I deleted it on my drive,
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.060]   I have some sense of when it was deleted.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.420]   - Right, you deleted online,
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.020]   it may be sitting there for years.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.620]   - Well, same thing applies to some of the
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.180]   spreadsheets online,
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.020]   this possibility exists that you can go
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.860]   through the application. - I mean,
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.140]   if you don't have full control over it,
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.540]   you can never be sure.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.380]   - Yeah.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.900]   - Yeah, but the thing is, I mean,
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.860]   even if you are, do have full control over it.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.540]   How hard is it to, you know,
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.420]   the federal government comes in and hits your ISP
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.580]   with a subpoena or it hits you with a subpoena.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.500]   - Same thing.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.800]   - You know, you get a choice between a
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.340]   contempt of court for modifying the log files
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:44.160]   or disappearing underground across the border.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   - But the question is, for a lot of those ISPs,
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.960]   for a lot of those ISPs, I mean,
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.120]   we talked about this before,
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.780]   they delete most of that stuff, just storage.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.360]   I mean, you know, just for storage reasons,
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.580]   they don't keep that stuff around,
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.080]   they don't keep your log files around.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.380]   I mean, they keep them around for some period of time,
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.000]   but not, but very fairly short,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   because when you have thousands of subscribers,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.520]   - It's a couple of months, right?
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.800]   I think what I heard was a couple of weeks,
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.240]   you know, and after that, it's gone,
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.600]   because they just don't have the time to,
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.440]   I mean, they don't have to store,
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.080]   they're not gonna expend storage on it.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.160]   - Yeah, we should. - Yeah, it's the ability.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.000]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.800]   Well, the only thing it would open them up to
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.360]   is having the government talk to them all the time.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.840]   So why bother?
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.600]   - Yeah, he was like, he was forced to.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.880]   - You know, the guy who did that,
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.400]   you know, the company.com guy,
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.880]   but he would just erase everything instantly.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.080]   And, you know, there's all kinds of slander
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.200]   and libel on that site,
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.240]   and it's just like you couldn't track any of it.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.680]   And he managed to keep that site up for a really long time.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.240]   - There's the DoD wipe and the HUD wipe.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.920]   - The HUD wipe was apparently pretty good, I guess, huh?
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   (laughing)
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.240]   - But he did the, you know, it was a weird situation.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.080]   - I wrote that.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.600]   - But I think that that used to be very popular
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.720]   with the ZD TV phones, - Yes.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.960]   - Because there was all kinds of,
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.560]   there was a bunch of creepy guys
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.680]   that apparently that worked at Tech TV,
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.520]   that were posting all kinds of weird stuff,
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.360]   and it was all on--
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.080]   - Also, we were all there when like,
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.600]   the .com boom kind of was nearing its end,
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.840]   and so like this company had stuff about
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.840]   all these dying--
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.920]   - Can I point out that every time you guys say that,
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.840]   that Alex has to go in and bleep that out.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.280]   - Oh, shit, okay.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.680]   - We've only said it twice,
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.280]   had 102 and 103.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.120]   - You said it--
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:19.960]   - Oh, you said it.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.800]   - I said three times.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.640]   - Yes, by the way--
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.480]   - You also know.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.800]   - FC now has personals.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.120]   - FC.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:25.960]   - It does?
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.480]   - Delete, expert of company.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   Has personal.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.560]   - It does.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.480]   - No, no, it doesn't have the same sort of--
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.320]   - The star's most--
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   - The, don't know, don't wanna know.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.600]   It's just noticed that they're on the page.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.560]   - I'm poor and broke looking for someone else's
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   poor and broke.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.400]   (laughing)
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.120]   - I mean, I'm--
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.760]   - So we got anything else before we finished,
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.600]   we're almost done.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.280]   - Before another digital.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.120]   - Almost.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.920]   (laughing)
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.280]   - As far as I'm concerned.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.120]   (laughing)
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.560]   - Oh man, you might have been playing around
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.440]   with the live.com?
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.360]   - The Microsoft thing?
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.200]   - Yeah.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.040]   - No, I haven't.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:57.880]   I'm not gonna play.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.720]   - It doesn't work on my back.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.440]   - Actually it'll work on Firefox.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.280]   - Oh, really?
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.640]   - It just doesn't work on,
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.080]   just doesn't work on Safari.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.480]   - Oh, I gotta try it.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   - Safari's terrible.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.360]   - Safari, yes, Safari has issues.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.040]   The thing I thought was funny is Verizon and T-Mobile.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.840]   JD Powers did a call quality survey.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.600]   And Verizon and T-Mobile got the ratings
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.400]   for the clearest crawls across the country
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.720]   and Singular has trouble making connections
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.560]   off of a survey of roughly 24,000 wireless users.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.040]   I thought that was pretty funny.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.880]   Verizon had the best service in the mid-Atlantic
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.040]   in the Southeast.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.040]   T-Mobile ranked highest in the Southwest in West
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.640]   and US Cellular did best in Illinois,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.560]   Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.520]   - So it's got spotty in it.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.080]   I mean, everyone that has Verizon around here
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.800]   complains bitterly about it.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.120]   - Verizon just wouldn't,
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.560]   when we moved into our new house,
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.280]   Verizon just wouldn't work in our house
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.920]   in the surrounding three blocks.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.120]   It was bizarre thing I've ever run into.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.400]   So we ended up having to just dump it.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.520]   - It is an horrible thing.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.760]   - Well, no, I've been to Patrick's place.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.320]   He's got aluminum foil up everywhere
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.600]   for some reason, where's a hat?
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.920]   - Even outside, no hat on.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.160]   - It's a baseball cap,
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.600]   it's inside the baseball cap
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.920]   that he's stuffed to the aluminum foil.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.480]   So it looks pretty normal.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.760]   - Hey, man, don't diss the safety hat.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.800]   - What I find it's funny is that the places
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.280]   that you would think would use it the most,
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.320]   I mean, with all of this stuff,
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   you could fool San Francisco.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.240]   No, I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my Bluetooth,
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.360]   you know, my little Bluetooth headset for my trio.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.640]   And in San Francisco, you know, some walking around
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.160]   and it's always messed up and everything else.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.440]   And of course, I go to Pennsylvania to visit my family.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.640]   - And it works perfectly.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.480]   - Clear as a bell.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.720]   You know, it was just like all right now.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.880]   - Well, what's interesting, right,
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.720]   is one of the things that Ben out from Sasha Sagan,
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.080]   he does all the cell phone interviews at PCMag,
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.440]   is one of the things, basically,
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.560]   if you look for the company that had,
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.400]   basically, each of the R-Box essentially got first hit
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.000]   on the lower frequency signals,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.320]   which penetrate better, which have better signal.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.480]   What do you call it when signals trap-
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.160]   - In relation to the walls better.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.320]   - Propagation.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.280]   And so basically, the R-Box got the good signal frequencies
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.880]   in every area and then everybody who came in later
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.040]   got the not so good, the higher frequencies.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.000]   So whoever is, whoever, basically, you go to the area,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.280]   you know, if you're in the south,
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.600]   you end up with whoever.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.240]   - That's as good as those old analog cell phones.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.440]   - Well, analogs things sounded great.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.120]   - And they still sound great for a lot of people
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.600]   who live in the sticks, but in 2007,
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.640]   they're phasing out all the analog cell phones.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.960]   - Yeah, well, they're not efficient.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.000]   - Smoked signals.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.160]   - Yeah, but it's like basically all the older vendors,
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.960]   I guess, would it be Verizon and New York
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.520]   was Verizon started by 9X?
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.520]   It all bleeds together after a while.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.960]   - It's all slowly doing back together.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.600]   - Yeah, it's all becoming AT&T again.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.520]   - Yeah, I know, AT&T got broken up
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.360]   and now it's like bigger than all of this.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.160]   - It's like, you know, it's like Terminator 3.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.400]   - It just keeps coming back.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.560]   - Whatever you do, it just keeps reforming.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.080]   - Is that what Arnold Schwarzenegger's gonna do
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.480]   as soon as he loses the next start of the phone report?
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.920]   - It's gonna go back and do Terminator 4.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.000]   - Might as well.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.080]   - Why is it that a robot can make a prediction?
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.280]   - Did I just make a prediction, though?
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.960]   (laughing)
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.120]   - You wanna talk about his running for president in 2008?
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.120]   - He's not running for president.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.960]   More likely that George will go for a third term.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.080]   - No, it's gonna be Hillary Clinton versus somebody.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:11.920]   - Alright, stop.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.480]   - Just don't even go there.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.960]   No politics.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.880]   - I can tell you, I'll do one political thing.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.600]   I'm gonna tell you right now, it's gonna be McCain
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.160]   and Giuliani, that's your ticket.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.600]   - McCain. - Unbeatable.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.840]   - The Democrats can't beat it, the Republicans can't beat,
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.240]   that's your ticket.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.960]   - Yeah, but-- - You heard it here first.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.400]   (laughing)
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.680]   - We all remember-- - I was not gonna go for it.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.760]   - Sit there thinking like, "Hey, you're nasty."
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   (laughing)
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.440]   - Oh, I don't know if people say it's too smart.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.520]   - It's done deal, I'm not, it's just done.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.000]   - It's too smart, it wouldn't work.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.320]   - It's done deal, no, it's already done deal.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.480]   That's where McCain-- - So make the next ticket,
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.360]   like that, no, do another mixed ticket.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.600]   - Alright, alright, alright.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.160]   Okay, let's get back to tech.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.760]   We're almost done.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.600]   - Politics and porn right up there.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.440]   (laughing)
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.600]   - You wanna do it, you wanna finish?
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   We could do it as, we got to do it as the--
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.680]   - Someone printed a bunch of porn euros
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.720]   and they were passing them off,
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.560]   and I guess half of these countries--
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.640]   - Yeah, that's the devorac blog has a picture of it.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.600]   - Oh, it's-- - Go check it out,
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.280]   it's very funny. - I would, I have no internet.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.600]   - Oh, some guy, yeah, apparently they've been passing
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.200]   these things off and people have been taking them
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.560]   as real money, so he made this porn look like a your own out.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.960]   - Yeah, I'll show you, it's really funny,
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.360]   it's quite humorous actually.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.520]   - Wow. - WWE,
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.920]   - But what's tech's mean, is funny?
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.240]   - Is it, is it, one of these vendors,
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.400]   one of these vendors sees this,
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.160]   they're like, I don't recognize this, oh, it's a new one
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.320]   that hasn't been distributed yet,
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.000]   and so the news magazine stand guys are okay.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.120]   - Many kinds of-- - It's a 600
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:28.960]   - No, it's half, no, man. - So it gives out
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.160]   500 somewhat euros and change,
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.040]   which is probably about 600, 700 bucks.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.680]   - Here's the 300 euro note,
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.680]   it's got a couple of scippers on, it's quite humorous.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.520]   (laughing)
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.080]   - Wow, I can't attest to it, it is quite humorous.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.640]   (laughing)
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.860]   Although it is kind of,
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.160]   - That's a good point, you know what?
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.120]   (laughing)
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.760]   - I'm shielding my eyes.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.480]   - It belongs to the XXX domain.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.720]   - Yeah, I think he'd say dot XXX on that.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.080]   - So people, what, they don't look at it?
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.200]   I mean, yeah, oh no, it's colorful, it has a watermark.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.560]   It looks like Monopoly money.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.400]   - I don't know, I think they made a big one.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.800]   - Actually Monopoly money looks like that,
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.360]   I would have played Monopoly a lot more.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.880]   - The kicker gag is where they have,
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.320]   you know, the European Union thing with the circle of stars,
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.160]   it's the same stars, but they're in the form of a heart.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.000]   - Yeah, oh.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.840]   (laughing)
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.320]   - No, but it's also like, it's got a certain,
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.800]   like the Greek god of like,
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.640]   - Alex Linde, your pixel core,

[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.360]   'cause it's on the 23rd,
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.960]   but you can get a lift ticket
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.360]   and like a room for like 70 bucks.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.000]   - You signing autographs?

[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.360]   - It's about 80 bucks, I think.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.440]   - And it's February 23rd.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.280]   - March 23rd.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   - March 23rd.

[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.480]   - Yes, I'm getting married down in LA
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.520]   and then going to Vancouver.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.440]   - You wanna tell him where it is?
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.720]   - No, I'm not gonna say it.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.400]   - Hey, wait, let's invite the fans.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.520]   - It's a nice church.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.880]   Nice glass church.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.720]   That's all.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.120]   - Oh, the Crystal Cathedral in Garden.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.560]   - Not the Crystal Cathedral.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.360]   - Yes, I am.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.720]   I'm at the Crystal Cathedral.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.120]   (laughing)
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:56.960]   I'll be this--
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.800]   - There'll be a bunch of people,
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.640]   there'll be someone at a wedding.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.800]   I'll be the big crowd of people standing outside
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.040]   and they're like, we're here.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:02.880]   - Alex!
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.240]   - They're like, Alex!
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.840]   - How many glass churches are there down there?
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.360]   - Where are you registered, Alex?
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.200]   (laughing)
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.400]   - Yeah, that's until straight.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   - Suddenly I'll start getting all the damn room.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.440]   - Oh, anyway, so I thought you could use these.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.920]   - So I won't be here, that's all I'm gonna say.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   There'll be a whole 'nother crew here to,
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.400]   I think we're shooting at the Golden Gate Studios next week.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.240]   - Oh, what's this?
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.080]   - Shooting the wedding?
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.160]   - No, you guys are shooting.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.000]   I am--
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.840]   - Fuck.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.600]   - You'll be disposed--
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.440]   - Absolutely, the more accurate--
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.520]   - with the damn of that blog.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.320]   - Devork.org/blog.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.800]   - And what's the name of the new television show?
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.640]   - Yeah, we're doing it.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.160]   I think for the Cranky Geek show.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.000]   - Cranky Geek.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.720]   - With your crews over there at San Francisco Studios
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.920]   for, it's on dltv.com.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.760]   What's the--
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.800]   - Crankygeeks.com.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.080]   - Cranky, we have our own URL.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.440]   - CrankyGym and CrankyGeeks.com.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.600]   And we've done a couple of shows and prints.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.120]   It's gonna be experimental for the first couple of months
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.960]   until they tell us to stop being experimental.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.560]   So every time you see it's gonna have a different set.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.160]   - No, I have to tell you to stop being,
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.000]   am I they?
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.560]   Or am I they my plus?
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.440]   - I think it's somebody up the ladder from you,
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.840]   'cause I don't think you care.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.680]   - Oh!
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.720]   - It's not that I don't care,
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.400]   it's just letting evolve.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.480]   - Yeah, that's what we're trying to do.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.840]   And then we've got good people there,
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.200]   so I think it'll be pretty interesting.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.400]   When we finally settle in on something,
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.040]   we're gonna play with some green screens too, I think.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.600]   - That I'm a little worried about.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.080]   - Well, you know, we can see what happens.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.600]   - But before I can space,
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.920]   what's the worst that can happen?
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.080]   - We can just make it into a body dead show.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.520]   - I've got a good camera for that.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.360]   - Oh dude.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.280]   (laughing)
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.080]   - Is that the one with the ring that shoots the thing?
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.440]   You gotta run those ring job.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.280]   - I have something better than that.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.520]   - I have some good ring jobbers.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.360]   - I have a--
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.200]   (laughing)
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.040]   - That's how they feel.
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.320]   - You have to check out Macbreak.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.840]   You have to go on the scenes.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.000]   It's got all the, our little camera.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.840]   - It's not really good.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.680]   - I like it.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.520]   - Are you enjoying it?
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.360]   - Yeah.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.200]   - Did you see the one with the XP?
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.040]   Did that--
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:44.880]   - I did not see the one with the XP.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.880]   That was the most reason one, right?
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.720]   - Yeah, that's the one.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.400]   - No, I watched the behind 1080i.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.240]   Was it 1080p?
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.080]   - Right, that was the behind 1080i.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.480]   - 1080p 'cause I is evil.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.800]   - Well, I second best, that's why.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.720]   - It's, I was gonna say something
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.400]   that would cause me to have to edit.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.240]   - You have to edit another thing.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.080]   - I'm too lazy.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:00.920]   - Uh oh.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.840]   (laughing)
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.720]   - Well, you're ready to end it.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.160]   We can do our little six.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.000]   - Ready?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.840]   - I'll do the countdown, ready?

[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.640]   - Another twin is in the can.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.880]   (laughing)
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.760]   - Leah, Leah is gonna be--
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.440]   - I think on the part where ever you are.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.360]   (laughing)
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.280]   - Leah's gonna be, what have they done to my show?
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.640]   (laughing)
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.480]   I leave for one week.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.160]   This is what Leah gets for.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.520]   - You know what I really like to get?
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.920]   - You know what, there's a funniest thing,
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.600]   I think an audio is a chorus of little girls.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.520]   (laughing)
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.200]   - Trying hard, you just all say something at once.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.000]   And if you can just give the chorus a little girl
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.840]   to say another twin is in the can.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.520]   It would be so funny.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.760]   (laughing)
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.340]   (upbeat music)

[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.340]   I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:41.180]   Too much work.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.900]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.620]   My server's completely collapsed.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:45.900]   So here's the deal.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.140]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.620]   but I have a hell of a ton of blue screens, like forget it.
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.980]   I'm killing you.
