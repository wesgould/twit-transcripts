[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   news.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.200]   A really expert astute smart panel today.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.320]   I'm a little intimidated.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.200]   I must confess.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.360]   Editorial director at IDG Jason Snell is here, formerly editor in chief at Macbreak.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   Weekly a Macbreak.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   Mac.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   Mac.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   Macworld.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360]   Macworld.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   Thank you.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.880]   I knew I'd have trouble today.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.680]   But you now PCworld, Macworld, the whole world.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680]   The whole shebang.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   He's got the whole world.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.680]   Macworld is where my heart is.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680]   But yes.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.680]   Great to have you.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   Great to be back.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.680]   Also, John C. de Vorak, who was an administrator without portfolio here at the show.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680]   Yeah, that's a ticket.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.040]   Anything you want to talk about, you can.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.080]   Whether it's wine, vinegar, vinegar, tech, tech.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.120]   I got to start making vinegar because we never could finish a bottle.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.360]   Well, at least you can start storing it.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   Can you get me a barrel?
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360]   What do you put it in?
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   Oh, don't put it in a barrel.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   No.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360]   What?
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   Rubber plastic.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.360]   You have to put it in something where you can actually see it.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.120]   Is it like the scene in Breaking Bad where Jesse tries to dissolve the body, but he doesn't
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   put him a plastic tub.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.920]   He puts him in the bathtub and he goes right through the floor.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   Is it like that?
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   No.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.280]   Also, with his Ben Thompson of Stratecary, Ben has worked everywhere, including Apple and
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.240]   Automatic.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.680]   His blog, Stratecary, is a, I guess you're kind of like an analyst for hire, kind of.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.320]   For anybody who wants to know more, you could subscribe and understand what's going on.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.200]   He's currently talking to us from Taiwan.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   Yes.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.360]   Well, I mean, there are free articles every week.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.840]   Oh, I read it religiously.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.880]   In fact, that's how we got you on the show.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.080]   I said, "This guy's smart."
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.560]   Well, I appreciate it.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.520]   What I didn't realize is that you used to, when you worked at Apple, you used to do marketing
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.760]   for Apple University.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.760]   Not marketing.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   I was just a bit curious and interned, but yeah, I was for Apple University back when
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.920]   no one really knew what it was.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.080]   Obviously, there's more details coming out.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.960]   We didn't until last week when the New York Times wrote a long article about it.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   What did you think of that?
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.280]   Was it accurate, given your experience?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.520]   I think, yeah, they got the big stuff right.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.400]   I think it's one of those things like a lot of stuff with Apple, where it's kind of taken
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.120]   on this outsized sort of mystique about it.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.400]   I think that the way it comes across in the article probably is about as flattering as
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   could be.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.240]   I think when you get actually into the specifics and the details, they're like anything else
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.520]   trying to figure stuff out.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.480]   But I mean, I think from my perspective, it's very useful because the more that's in the
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.280]   public domain, the more that I can talk about it.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.560]   So there's a big thing in Adam Wachinski had a big piece or he's written quite a few
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.040]   things about Apple and he's talked about it.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.760]   So that was kind of like, since then I talked about it.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   Adam's great.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   I love Adam.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.560]   Yeah, if he's been talking about it, then the world knows, I guess.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.880]   The New York Times, Brian X Chen really focused on this Picasso Bulls series and how they
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.680]   use one of their teachers uses slides to explain how you go from complex to simple.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.800]   Yeah, I think that was actually new.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.720]   That was kind of the big thing when I was there.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   That's really exciting.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.120]   It's a soul then.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.120]   What I like within the like the faculty or whatever, which is what they're called.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.040]   Everyone's like, you know, oh, this is great.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.760]   This really gets it.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.600]   I think the big problem I have with it and is yes, it's great and it's a wonderful illustration
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.960]   to get at the idea of simplicity and what Apple absolutely strives for.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.920]   At the end of the day, there's a very thin line between a really useful analogy and kind
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.240]   of cliche.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.680]   And I think the article kind of veered a whittle into cliche from my perspective, whereas what
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.560]   I found most fascinating, interesting was some of the real nuts and bolts stuff that
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.320]   they talked about when it came to things like organizational design and managing change
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.000]   and like very kind of much more in the gritty details that I think really do make Apple,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.160]   particularly unique.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.800]   It's one thing to talk about a painting and how it, oh, this is about simplicity.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.360]   But at the end of the day, like, how do you actually apply that making meaningful?
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.040]   And I do think there's more stuff that the university has done that is more like really
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.440]   useful and interesting, but it probably wouldn't fit very well in your attention profile anyway.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.080]   So actually, I think that profile gave Apple the permission to put Joel Podolny's picture
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.240]   on their executive.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.360]   They've re-done this executive profiles this week.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.360]   Yeah, that was really interesting.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.760]   And Joel, who was vice president, Dean, he was former dean at the Yale School of, or
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.760]   was it Harvard School of, no, it was Yale, business management, right?
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.240]   And now is full-time at Apple teaching.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.600]   And he's right there on the front page.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.000]   As is Paul DeNev, who's one of the newest hires, he's from a fashion.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.240]   You've somewhere right?
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   YSL.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.440]   And, but I thought if you're going to read tea leaves, the most interesting thing is
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.680]   up at the top where you've got Tim Cook, the CEO, number two, Angela Aronson.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.640]   Well, I believe alphabetically she is.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   Number two.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   Oh, that shouldn't be it.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   So is it okay?
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.960]   So Cook first and then alphabetical after that.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.600]   But Johnny Ives got to look at that and go, Hey, wait a minute.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.320]   Well, I should be up there.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.760]   He should be online too.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.800]   A-A-V-E, pronounced by a few of that.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.640]   Well, if you want, if you want to actually, if you want to get into, you know, Apple
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.040]   criminology, I think actually, from my opinion, the most interesting part of, and I actually,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.760]   I did write about this in that daily update, was the correction.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.880]   And the correction talks about how they originally referred to Padone as the head of HR and he
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880]   no longer is.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   In the New York Times.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.880]   Right, exactly.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.200]   And so when he started, he was not, he was just doing Apple University.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.040]   And then Jobs asked him to take over HR, I think with the idea of there being kind of
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.400]   redoing HR and like in the new sort of way.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.720]   And I don't think it went as well, probably as everyone would have liked it.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.320]   And so now there's more traditional HR head and he's back to doing Apple University.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.800]   I have learned as a-
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   Totally interesting.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   Entrepreneur.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   That HR is a fairly tough thing to do well.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.840]   That's where you hire specialists, usually heartless people.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   Heartless.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.040]   They've got to be, that's why you bring in George Clooney to fire people.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.360]   Because you don't want to do it.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.800]   No, really seriously, it is a, it is a highly skilled job.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.960]   It is not, well I don't know about the skill.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   Heartless isn't something you don't need to go to school for.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.680]   There are good HR people in their bad HR people.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.600]   I think HR is a problem in tech because you get so many headstrong tech industry executives
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.840]   who really, and Steve Jobs was a great example of this, who really want to do, you know,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.840]   what they want to do and they don't really care about like-
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   Right, illegal things.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.320]   Yeah, they don't care about the law or that thing.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.520]   Fairly or anything like that.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   And a good HR person is the one who has to-
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   Oh Steve.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.960]   And has to push back a little back and see if we can't do that.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.600]   It's a violation of the Sherman Andy Trusstack, Steve.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.400]   Yeah, so for the HR people.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.560]   I mean, I have to put a two-part print on it.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.760]   Like what Apple did to its employees is terrible.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.000]   Like- You're talking about the jobs, jobs thing.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Yeah, the collusion.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yeah, collusion.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Collusion.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.680]   To say that you can't, that no one's going to recruit you is to basically, women pay.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.560]   And I'm not one to complain about Apple's money and say that they ought to do this or
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.560]   that.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.440]   But in this specific case, it's quite warranted.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.960]   Apple was raking in like the greatest profits ever.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.640]   At the same time, they were denying a fair wage to their employees.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.640]   Like people aren't nearly as upset about this as they should be, in my opinion.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.800]   Well, it's not over.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.080]   The DOJ didn't the court overturn the settlement and say, "Let's go back because it's not a
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.200]   sufficient punishment."
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.800]   And there was a list published, a hand-rich list.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.280]   You can see some of the executives from Apple and throw them in jail.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.280]   That would change things.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.600]   Yeah, unfortunately, the guy who probably was behind it is probably Steve Jobs.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.640]   Yeah, the people had the sign off on it.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.640]   When you can see it.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.440]   Hitler was behind a lot of things too, and he'd tell the guys what they did.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.080]   The DOJ settled like a few years ago over this.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.160]   Just so for people to catch up on this, Apple agreed with many other companies not to poach
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.720]   each other's employees.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.920]   That is actually against the antitrust act because the idea is a company keeps wages and
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.280]   salaries low and keeps workers in their place by making sure that they can't get a better
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   offer.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   They can't actually negotiate.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.480]   They can't get competitive.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.680]   The DOJ reached the settlement with Apple, Adobe, Google, Intel, and Tewit and Pixar in
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680]   2010.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.880]   But I think, as I remember, the courts just overturned that settlement.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.120]   Yeah, this is still going on.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.640]   And the Pixar thing is another example where I sense Steve Jobs' influence.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.640]   And it's the same thing.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.400]   From the perspective of somebody running a company, you're like, "God, we keep losing
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.480]   momentum because our people keep getting poached by other companies, and that's really inconvenient
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   for us."
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.760]   I honestly don't believe that the reason they did it was to save money, but it has the net
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.560]   effect of suppressing the wages of the people.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   If you're an Apple engineer and Google comes and offers you a raise, the response should
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.000]   be that Apple should pay you more to keep you or say, "It's okay.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.280]   You can walk," not to make a deal with Google to withdraw their offer, which is essentially
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.160]   in a large scale what this collusion did.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   It's awful.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.320]   No, that's exactly right.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.560]   And I think Jason is right to say that it was to avoid disruption.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.960]   I think the thing with Jobs in particular is, and what is really the most fascinating about
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.360]   being at Apple is there's the whole, everywhere in tech has the whole idea of overchanging
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.520]   the world and all this sort of thing.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.640]   And a lot of it is just talk, but at Apple, it sounds just cliché in corny, but it really
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.720]   is a very real sentiment.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.400]   There is a sense of changing of mission driven, and certainly that was the case with Jobs.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.560]   And I think he had a hard time with anyone that would even consider, "How could you
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.160]   even fathom wanting to go or work anywhere else?"
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.720]   And I imagine there's a whole potent mixture of stuff that went into this.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.400]   But at the end of the day, it was wrong.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.440]   And your point about HR needing to stand up, that sort of stuff is exactly right.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.640]   Imagine standing up to Steve Jobs, whoever you are though.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.400]   That would be very, very difficult.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.760]   Or anybody under pressure who's got a lot of VC investment and has a startup, right?
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.160]   I mean, those startups happen so fast, they get used to breaking rules or not having rules.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.400]   And at some point you need HR, and then the HR person just is seen as an impediment who's
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.200]   ruining your nimble startup from pivoting into whatever it's pivoting into.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   It's a tough call.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.840]   And I do believe this is one of the reasons why you hear so many horror stories about
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.360]   bad behavior in Silicon Valley.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.800]   One of the reasons is, I mean, there's not a culture of responsibility in a lot of these
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.480]   companies because by the time a culture is built, that's when they say, "Oh, we should
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.600]   probably have some HR people in here."
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.800]   I mean, HR isn't a solution and oftentimes it can be a problem too.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.200]   But I do think the grownups sometimes are the HR people and if they don't have any power,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   then it's too late.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   Apple, go ahead.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.440]   No, I just say the one thing that does kind of, I think raises eyebrows though, is that
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.640]   the judge presiding this is in this case.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.640]   Lucico!
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.440]   No, it's Denise Coat who I think is actually the first.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   Oh, it's a cote.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.440]   Oh, is it a cote?
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   I don't know.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   I say cote, just because it sounds more French.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.640]   I mean, who by the way, I think is not getting nearly enough credit for what's happening with
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:35.040]   Amazon and Hashette because this whole mess is her fault.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:42.360]   And so, and she's the one who imposed the much hated oversight at Apple, the guy who
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.120]   went in and interviewed Apple executives.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.120]   Her friend, who?
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.840]   Who do happen to be your buddy?
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:54.040]   Well, she basically denied a market-based solution to the Amazon, Hashette issue.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.640]   And she hardly seems impartial when it comes to Apple.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.480]   So I think her rejecting the settlement, well, possibly is the right thing to do.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.200]   But certainly, I think raises eyebrows justifiably so.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.000]   I'm looking at this article from August 8th.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   It said it was Denise.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.680]   I mean, sorry, Lucico, who was the judge.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.280]   The award or the agreed upon settlement was $324 million.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.640]   That was overturned by US District Judge Lucico in San Jose, who ruled that the amount to
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.720]   be paid by the Giants was insufficient.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   Doesn't, yeah.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   Oh, you're right.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.720]   I'm totally wrong.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   But Lucico is well-known.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.560]   Lucico is notorious as the judge of the Samsung Apple lawsuit.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.640]   So it seems like there's really only two judges in Silicon Valley.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.960]   And they're responsible for everything going on today.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.600]   Oh, you're right.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.880]   And I think, yeah, I have a much bigger beef with Cote.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.840]   So that actually makes me feel better.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.680]   Cote was absolutely clearly an anti-Apple advocate.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.640]   On the other hand, you could probably make the case that Judge Co is pro-Apple.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.520]   She's certainly been ruling an Apple's favor in the Samsung lawsuit.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.520]   I don't know.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.960]   I'm sure both of these judges are--
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   They're all happening.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.440]   It sounds like conflicts of interest left in the white.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.720]   They have no conflict of interest.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.600]   They're good people doing their best at a difficult environment.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.680]   They kind of wear those black robes in a hot day.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.520]   You don't have to wear the black robe.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.960]   You don't wear a white robe?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   You can't?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   Sure.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   You look like a choir director.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   There's no law that says you have to wear the black robe.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   Really?
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   No.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   Show me that it's a Methodist with a law.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   A judge can wear whatever they want?
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   I don't know if they can wear whatever they want.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   Yeah, probably.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.960]   Why not?
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   I'd wear a black robe.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.720]   It's only for the bull crap.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.720]   It's just to make it--
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.360]   Well, it's a scale of injustice.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.320]   Wouldn't it be good if they wore a little, I don't know, a blindfold?
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.520]   I don't think you'd get voted out if you wore something.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.840]   Maybe the wig would be good.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   A powdered wig.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   This would be a great this week in law topic.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   I want to know.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840]   Yeah, bring up in the law.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   Why do judges wear black robes?
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.840]   Are they not required to?
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   Why would they be required to?
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   How would this work?
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   You get the job.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.120]   You go to the office, bang it on the peg on the back of the door.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   I'm going to--
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   I'm going to look at it up in the book of knowledge.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   Will you?
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   Look at the book of knowledge while I'm doing the show.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   Why do judges wear black robes?
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:15.120]   I love this, the secretary of the Thailand FCC, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:24.120]   Commission, tweeted that he had approved two new iPhone models, the A1586 and 1524.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   Apple, a little miffed.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.640]   They're saying what?
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.680]   You tweeted that you've approved two new iPhone models.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.880]   They've actually asked to meet with him.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.480]   He said, no, there's no confidential information here.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.720]   This is within my job.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.960]   I'm supposed to publicize this approval.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.640]   But they do point out you've never tweeted before, Mr. Minister.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.800]   So we know there are two new iPhone models, at least in Thailand.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.080]   Do you think, Jason?
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   That's 4.7 and 5.5?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   That's the rumor.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   That wouldn't be unreasonable.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.840]   Or what is the variation on an existing model?
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.600]   Yeah, like a 5SC--
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.600]   Something.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   For the chief.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   For the chief.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   H.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   Sub-paragraph.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   Very confusing title.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   But yeah, it could be.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.160]   I mean, this is the problem with these devices is between the supply chain and the regulatory
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   bodies.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   It is hard.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.360]   These are not things designed to keep a secret.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360]   Right.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   Which Apple--
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   And you have to submit these.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   Well, I'm sure the FCC has whatever they are as well.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.120]   Because it takes a while to get approval.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.320]   Remember when the iPhone first came out?
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.440]   And it was announced in what was it January?
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.280]   And pending FCC approval.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.720]   And it took them six months before they actually released it.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.960]   And one of the reasons they announced it so early is because they knew it could leak
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.360]   out of the FCC.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.720]   The FCC does have some ways around it.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.200]   It seems like the details now are often released publicly the day that the product
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.200]   does announce.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.080]   So I think that once you've got--
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.240]   The problem with the iPhone was that Apple didn't want to admit that it existed.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.120]   And it was going to have to start the process.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.760]   Yeah, if it's a first time product, there's a different track than if this is an update
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.760]   on an existing product.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.760]   Right.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:07.400]   I think the other thing too is I think kind of one of the objections to the 5.5 inch
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.360]   rumor has been that there haven't been parts leaks like there have for the 4.7 inch.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.280]   But I think over the last week, there's been actually several.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.840]   So I go back and forth as to whether it exists or not.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.240]   But that certainly has been a change of signal as far as that goes.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.560]   I actually want to-- since you're in Taiwan, we're going to take a break.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.520]   I want to ask you about the OnePlus One fiasco.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.720]   And maybe get your take on this.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.520]   Because I talked to one of our editors who's also from Taiwan.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.640]   He says, "It's not what you think."
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.560]   And then we're going to find out why Justice is where Black wrote.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   Yes, we are.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.440]   John C. de Vorac has learned the facts.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.440]   But that's coming up.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.800]   You're going to do a teaser.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   That's a tease, baby.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.280]   Because first, I want to talk about my mattress.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.880]   Podcasts don't need teasers.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   You've talked about this before.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.080]   I know, because all you have to do is just basically saying fast forward now.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   Right?
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   So--
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   Actually, by hurting your spot.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   The thing is, you're so good.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.920]   You're so entertaining with these ads that I don't see anyone doing.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.880]   This is one you don't want to miss.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.280]   This is a brand new sponsor.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.040]   You are going to want to stay tuned for this ad.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.840]   It's about mattresses.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.560]   I have-- in fact, we're going to do an unveiling.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.760]   I have, in my foyer, a box.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.440]   Yeah, it's not even very big box.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.440]   Yay big.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.960]   Inside that box is a queen mattress from Casper.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.160]   And I can't even believe.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   I like it.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   I haven't even slept on it yet.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.880]   And I thought this is so cool.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.920]   And I sent one to Henry in Colorado because he's got a--
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.440]   in fact, he just flew out today.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.000]   And he's going to have a new room.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And he needs a bed.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.200]   And I said, Henry, I'm going to send you a Casper in a box.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   He has a new room.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   You said broom.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   A new room.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   Okay.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.560]   I'm going to have a house with nine other guys in his friend.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   Wow.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   That's going to be fun.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.400]   These are incredible.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.000]   But you know, even if they give it to you for 100 days to try.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.480]   And I got to tell you, buying a mattress is not a great experience.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.000]   You go to a mattress showroom.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   You lie down.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   You're fully clothed.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   You're wearing your shoes.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.200]   Somebody's giving you the evil eye.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.720]   And you're pretending, you know, well, how would this be to sleep?
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.760]   That's not a good way to test a mattress.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.720]   Casper is revolutionizing the mattress industry.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.320]   First of all, very affordable.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.200]   The queen mattress I bought, Henry, 800 bucks.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   Good deal.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.720]   They cut out the showroom and the reseller.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.880]   They pass that savings directly onto you.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.120]   People have told me this is the most comfortable mattress they've ever had.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   I'm going to be the judge of that.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.800]   We're going to open it up tonight and I'm going to sleep on my Casper.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.720]   Just the right combination of latex and memory foam.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.080]   I love memory foam because it sinks.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.160]   You sink in, but it's firm.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.160]   It's weird.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   It's just what you want.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.800]   It's a firm mattress that's comfy and soft.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.080]   It provides long lasting comfort and support.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.840]   $500 for a twin, $950 for a king size mattress.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.520]   You could buy it online and there is no risk because they will deliver it free and you
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.520]   have 100 days.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.520]   100 days.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   What is that?
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.200]   3.27 months to try it out.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.280]   You don't have to lie down in the showroom and the returns easy if you decide if you're
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.560]   100 days, you don't like it.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.640]   This is the way to try it.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.520]   By the way, made in the USA, this is great.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.360]   We're going to give you 50 bucks off your brand new Casper.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.600]   Go to Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R-Sleep.com.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.400]   Casper, sleep.com/twit.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   This is nice.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.280]   For every mattress purchased at Casper, they're going to donate $50 to child's play.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.760]   You save 50 bucks, child's play gets 50 bucks.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.240]   Oh, you want to save more?
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   Refer a friend.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.440]   You'll get $50 off your mattress.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.880]   Actually, you've already got the mattress.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.520]   You'll get a $50 retail gift card.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.080]   They'll get $50 off their mattress.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.320]   They do limit you to 10 referral redemptions per customer.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.320]   That's a lot of money.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.880]   You could be doing pretty well here.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.240]   Brand new sponsor really thrilled to welcome them.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.800]   It's a startup.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   I love this idea.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   Casper, sleep.com/twit.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.840]   You buy one with Bitcoin.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.200]   You know, that's great.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   I don't know.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.600]   I don't think that is, but okay.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.680]   Buy it with Bitcoin.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.960]   I want to ask them if they will let me buy it with Bitcoin.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   Beautiful.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:12.280]   It's somewhere between, by the way, firmness, a cotton ball and a shiny diamond.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.840]   Not quite a piece of Jello, not quite a dense novel.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.560]   Somewhere in the middle.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.840]   It's the Goldilocks standard of just right.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.480]   You are going to really love it.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.400]   I'm going to open the box tonight and sleep on it tonight.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   Are you going to film it?
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   Because I don't understand.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   Did you see the box?
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   It's this big.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.600]   How a queen mattress, it's going to go.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   Fuck!
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.600]   I can't wait.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.240]   I like to get it back in the box.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   It's impossible.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.240]   That's a good question.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.800]   Say you can return it.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   You can return it.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.640]   I don't think you're required to get it back in the box.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   That would be pretty funny.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.760]   Ever see those t-shirts?
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.560]   They have compressed to this little ball.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.200]   They shoot them out of a t-shirt cannon.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.360]   That's what we need.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   You do.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   A t-shirt cannon.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.360]   I could shoot these guys point blank.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   Knock them off.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   Boom.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.360]   Boom.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.360]   Boom.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.360]   Ah!
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   Pretty close.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   Or a mattress cannon.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   A mattress cannon.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.200]   That'd be fun.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.440]   You should do this.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.240]   I'm not doing any of these things.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   It's dumb.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   Okay.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.960]   I told the world, "I will do it if John tells me to do it."
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.360]   This is the ice bucket challenge.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.520]   Everybody's doing it.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.160]   Bill Gates has done it.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.120]   Tim Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   Tim Cook did it.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.920]   Jeff Bezos did it and all hands made it.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.720]   So Tim Cook for that matter.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.080]   That's all because they did it.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   Did you see Bill Gates?
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   It's your pressure.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   Ice Bill.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   Ice Bill's going to catch a cold.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.320]   He takes it fairly seriously.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.080]   Well, he may not because if you watch the video, you be the judge of this.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.760]   It doesn't look like there's actually any ice in Bill's bucket, which is not a euphemism.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.000]   That's actually...
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.560]   You know.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.560]   So here he is.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.560]   Bill's getting the challenge from Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.040]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.760]   So this is how it works.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.400]   It's to raise awareness and money for ALS, which is Lou Gehrig's disease.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   Right.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400]   And you dump a bucket...
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   It's kind of dumb.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   A bucket of ice water on yourself.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.720]   And it indicates Lou Gehrig's disease to dump a bucket of water.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   Ice water.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.280]   It doesn't seem like it's related in any way.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.920]   Of course, then you challenge three other people.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.840]   Zuckerberg challenged Bill and of course, Bill's taken this seriously as an engineering
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   problem.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.320]   So he pretends to weld stuff.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.880]   You know, he's got better things to do with his time, it seems to me.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.880]   I think he's...
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.320]   You know, give him a hundred million dollars and leave the welding to someone else.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   But watch carefully.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   He's about to do it.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   Well, that's what I...
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   This is what Bob is...
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.320]   This whole thing's a publicity.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.320]   I'll do it in private.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   How about that?
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   I'm going to challenge three more.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.320]   I won't make a video.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.320]   What are you...
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   What are you doing?
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.320]   I'm bothering you.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   Brian C. Crust and Chris Chansman.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   There's plenty of charities out there.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   You're giving the ones you want to give to.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.320]   Yeah, it feels like Blackstone.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   You shouldn't be shamed into giving to Andy one of them.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   It feels like good luck.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   And watch.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   There's no ice.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320]   I think it's warm water.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   Yeah, where's the ice?
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   There's no ice.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.120]   I think they said, Bill, if you do that with ice, you're going to have a stroke.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.120]   Nice bucket.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.120]   Full of water.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   Yeah, good times.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   Looks just like the wet doggy is.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.120]   That's the first bath Bill's had in years.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.120]   Oh, I didn't say that.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120]   Ooh.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   Ooh.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   I hear that.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   Oh, I got one of the guys in the room here.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.120]   He's allowed to have fun, Dvorak.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.120]   Yeah, that looks like fun.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:36.120]   I think Elon Musk did it equivalently put Jello in the bucket.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.120]   It's complicated.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   It's apparently involving, I don't know, multiple and his five kids.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.120]   They each had their own buckets.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.120]   They should have thrown a bucket at him.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   I think it'd be more entertaining.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.120]   He's looking more like Tony Stark all the time, isn't he?
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120]   He thinks he's Tony Stark.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   I think he's modeled after Tony Stark was supposedly modeled after him.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.120]   The one in the movie.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   Yeah, the one in the movie.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.120]   So anyway, so you say it's okay if I don't do that, I can give to whatever you want.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.120]   What do you ask for me for?
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.120]   If you don't do it, just give it.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.120]   You give a hundred dollars to Andy.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.120]   You give a hundred dollars to Andy.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   Even there, it's kind of blackmail though, right?
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.120]   You gave a hundred bucks.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   So I was skeptical about it.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   My friend Lex Friedman did a bucket challenge.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   And when I analyze the video frame by frame and believe me, I analyzed it frame by frame.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.120]   Where is this?
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.120]   It appears, I wish I had the link to it.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.120]   It appears that the ice completely missed him and he remained completely dry.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   And so I basically made him do it again.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   When he did it again, I wrote a check.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   Talk about...
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.120]   That's a good friend.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120]   Holy cow.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   Well, I made him get wet.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   Did you see Weird Als?
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.520]   The funny thing about Weird Al is he doesn't mention ALS.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   He doesn't...
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.040]   It's not a chat room, A-hole.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   What if your son had ALS-Lio?
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.120]   I know I actually have very close friend who died of ALS.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.120]   There you go.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   I am not against ALS and I...
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.120]   Why would you be...
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   It's a horrible product.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.120]   Lex is in the chat room.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   What am I thinking?
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.120]   Well, it's terrible disease.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.840]   And I'm not in any way saying anything negative about that or the ALS foundation, which is
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.760]   a good group or association.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.760]   So here's Weird Als.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.760]   I just...
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.800]   And by the way, I don't know if ALS, the ALS association did this.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.640]   I think it was kind of done by somebody independently.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.640]   They've picked it up.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   But they have certainly picked it up.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   And it's been good.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   They've raised more than $10 million.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   I think it's a very good...
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   What?
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   Very good devotion.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   Here's Weird Alsion.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   Somewhere like Hawaii, I think.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.320]   What a perfect day.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.200]   The only thing that would make this better is if I had a big bucket of ice water dumped
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   on my head right now.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.400]   He actually has ice in his.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.400]   Awesome.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.880]   Okay, I'm calling out Barack Obama, the Dalai Lama, and the Pope.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.400]   You're a move, guys.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   That's pretty good.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   Okay.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.880]   He doesn't mention any other...
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.320]   Any charity at all.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   No, but...
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   So he's...
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.120]   It's a parody of the thing.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   Dalai Lama.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   Yeah, that'd be one.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.120]   I'd watch that.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.360]   All right.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.000]   So it is effective marketing.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.840]   And also effective marketing, one plus, they make the flagship killer phone for 2014.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.200]   Really, I mean, not only great specs, but very inexpensive.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.200]   $29.99 for 16 gigs.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   It looks like a phone.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.600]   $350 for 64 gigs.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.200]   I'll unlock it so you can play with it.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   Try to wrap it.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.480]   But their marketing has left a little bit to be desired.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   When they first launched...
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.240]   Just the way you can't get the back off of.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.640]   Yeah, you tried last time.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.960]   It's not designed.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.560]   I think you can and put a different back on it, I guess.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.360]   Yeah, that would win it.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.360]   So the first marketing...
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.360]   By the way, you can't buy this.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.160]   What are you doing with one?
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.520]   Well, you have to get an invitation.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   I actually did not...
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.240]   Jason, did you get an invitation?
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.400]   I'm going to need you to check my mailbox again.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.400]   I don't recall.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.400]   No.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   Yeah, you didn't.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   That's the point.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.400]   The way you get this thing is...
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   Do you dump a bucket of ice water or something?
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   You can either get an invitation.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   If you want to...
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   If you want to...
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   If you want to...
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400]   If you want to...
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.240]   And it'll tell you the way you get one is by either getting an invitation for somebody
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.640]   else who's already got one.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.560]   Don't ask me because I don't have any.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.960]   Or you play a game or you do a contest or promotional event.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.480]   So the first one, which was horrible, was destroy...
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.000]   Send us a video of you destroying your smartphone and you'll get an invitation to buy another
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   one at full price.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Nice thing.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.800]   And people pointed out that that is really a waste of a smartphone, that there are plenty
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.000]   of people who would take this use smartphone.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.640]   You might even be able to sell it.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.720]   And certainly you should recycle it.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.760]   So, they pulled back.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.360]   Now this is what I want to ask Ben about because I think there might be a cultural golf
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.440]   here.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.680]   This week they said, "Well, we want to let the ladies jump ahead in line."
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.000]   So ladies, what we're asking you to do is put...
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Sexist?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Whoa, it gets worse.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.960]   Put the one plus logo on your body somewhere.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.160]   We'll put a picture of it up on our forums.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.360]   We'll let the forums vote and the ladies who have the best picture will get an invitation
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.360]   to...
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.360]   Contest.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.320]   Okay, that's what I thought.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.320]   That's what the world thought.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.120]   Gina Trapani, who has a one plus also, is thinking about sending hers back.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.120]   She's so incensed.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.720]   Uh, good for her.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.920]   However, and one plus has backed off.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.480]   However, Tony Wang, who's our senior editor here, and is from Taiwan, said, "You know,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.920]   it might be a cultural thing."
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.680]   He says, "When you see these people, you see people wear logos all the time.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.760]   Not on their butts or their boobs, but on their cheeks, on their hands, on their arms."
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.760]   They do.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.600]   So, Ben?
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.880]   I mean, I don't really have any sort of defense.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.280]   And to be clear, one plus is from China, not from Taiwan.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.760]   Oh, I thought they were from Taiwan.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.120]   They're from mainland China.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.680]   Yeah, they're in Shenzhen, like...
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   Oh, I didn't realize that.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   Oh, well then, okay, so it's not Taiwanese.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.680]   It's just the drop to Taiwan.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.160]   I do think, in general, there is a problem here.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.520]   I am by no means defending it of women being objectified in tech.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:55.160]   I mean, the whole booth babe phenomena, it's kind of originated in this side of the world.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.720]   It was going to copy text every June.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.920]   It's not as big as it used to be.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:07.280]   The big PC, annual PC, Bruha, there is still the whole booth babe thing going on.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:12.080]   And even just going to popular areas, there will be there promoting a game or putting
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.520]   an app.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.160]   So there's...
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.360]   I have zero defense for it.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.760]   I think it's horrible.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.000]   I think it's highly objectionable.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.160]   And quite honestly, I'm appalled they did it, but I'm also a little happy because then
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.120]   they can get their rear end kind of added to them for having done it.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.040]   Yeah, and it brought a lot of attention to this whole issue.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.400]   And negative, and rightly so.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.840]   And so I have no defense of it.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.440]   I hate that that happens here, that sort of culture.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.040]   And it's weird because in some respects, there are aspects of being a woman here that actually
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   quite good.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.200]   I think the head of HCC is a woman.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.080]   There's quite a few executives that are the head of the opposition party as a woman.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.280]   So there's aspects of society here that are fairly progressive.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.440]   But then there's parts like this that are anti-diluvian.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:13.720]   So you're saying the same thing about Latino culture being anti-diluvian?
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.680]   It happens to have all kinds of sexual innuendo and all kinds of angles.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.880]   Just wondering where you draw the line.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.080]   I draw the line if it's sexist sex.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:27.640]   So you think that Latino culture, you know, on Univision is a sexist, horrible thing?
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.840]   I'm not saying all that.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   I don't want to think about it.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   I'll just ask it.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.400]   I'm going to tell you, this guy's just trouble.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.640]   I'm just wondering what you think.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.280]   Maybe you don't.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.480]   No one's saying Latino culture is reprehensible, but to the degree that in any culture there
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.680]   are things like this that's reprehensible.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   Like what?
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   Like this contest.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.200]   Here's a one plus response.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:54.880]   Women make up half the world and we want to help them be more involved in tech.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.680]   We understand our content.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680]   Give them a job.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   Give them a job.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.680]   There you go.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   We understand our content was in bad taste and have therefore pulled it.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.040]   I find it more reprehensible.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.960]   These guys haven't got the backbone to stick with what they came up with.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.160]   They should have said, "We're sorry," or, you know, "We thought it was a good idea."
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.160]   The way they handle it is as though they they wimped out on it.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.760]   I think they should have gone through with the contest.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   Here's an example.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.360]   What's it going to hurt?
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.160]   Who's getting killed by this?
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.160]   Here's some posts.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.640]   This is mandy-leaves being strung up and Ted's chopped off.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.560]   She said, "I'm not offended by this.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.600]   I think she wants a phone."
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   You know, I just fall.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   Do you want an example?
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.520]   Here's an example of what I think Tony was mentioning.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   This is MSI's "How to Build a PC," where the logo is on someone.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.960]   Okay, that's not at all sexist.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.160]   What if it's on that bikini?
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.800]   This is "How to Build a Computer" from MSI.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   All right.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   So, I've...
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   You're hot in that room.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   She's...
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   All right.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   You could stop showing that, Ted.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   It looks like we're pandering, too.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   All right.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   I just can't be outright.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   I just can't be outright.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   There's faux outrage.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   There's faux outrage.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.600]   There's faux-extend people being murdered in the streets.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   Let's add, too.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.000]   I think it's a little worse, actually.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.960]   It's definitely worse.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.400]   But it doesn't mean we should allow anything short of murder is okay.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.000]   I don't think that we're...
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.520]   I don't think that we should be telling the Chinese what to do in such a way.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.360]   If they want to do these contests, just don't take part in the contest.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.160]   Right, and don't buy the phone.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   And you've got the phone.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   This is the most...
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.160]   Well, I bought it beforehand.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.000]   I'm just going to render at the table.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   You've actually supported this company.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   But that was before.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   But that was before this.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.800]   I'm really unclear what you're objecting to, John.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   I don't know.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   I'm just mentioning it in a moment.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   Well, Ben, Ben, don't try to be lodged.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   I think it's worth...
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   No, I think it's complaining.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   I'm just complaining.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:54.240]   Because the reality is, is one plus one has made a fairly significant splash.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.480]   I had one myself.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.360]   And if you don't object, then what is the difference?
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.160]   I mean, of course, no one...
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.360]   I don't think you're calling for anyone to endorse the action.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.760]   But to not speak up is not any different than going along with it.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   What is one?
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.160]   And quite frankly, yes, it's easy to be upset on Twitter and it doesn't make a huge difference.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.120]   And yes, to make a real difference for women in tech is to actually change your daily actions
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.080]   and all sorts of stuff.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.000]   But for goodness sake, this is appalling.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.560]   I think it's okay to call it that.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.760]   It's not murder.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:38.880]   By the way, what if one plus is response were, "Oh, let's do it for guys instead?
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.880]   Would that be okay?"
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.880]   Aha!
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   That would be different.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   I would be different.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   I would be different.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.880]   I would be different.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.880]   I would be different.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.880]   I would be different.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.880]   I would be different.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.880]   I would be different.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.880]   I would be different.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.880]   But that didn't happen.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   So why are we doing that?
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   That's what they should have done.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.880]   I mean, if I was the only one that didn't happen.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.880]   That would have been better.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.880]   I mean, I can formulate a reason that it would be okay.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.880]   By the way, I want to do that.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.560]   By the way, do you like the phone, Ben?
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.480]   I had no issue with the phone specifically.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   Oh, I like the phone.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   Okay.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   There we go.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480]   I don't like this phone.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   Why don't you like that?
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.800]   I find it very difficult to menu through.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.480]   For one thing, it doesn't have the back button, which I really like.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.480]   You know what?
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.760]   That's one thing that is kind of weird.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.760]   You can.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.120]   You have the option of putting it on screen like on your Nexus 5, but they have capacitive
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.880]   back buttons that are not lit very well.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   What's this?
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   What is this like?
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.880]   That's just a widget.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   That's how I've set mine up.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.880]   Not how you would have yours set up.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880]   And then go.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.080]   It's just you can't get off these screens.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.800]   There's no way of moving them navigating.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   It's terrible.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.520]   Get out of here.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:43.120]   Now, I had somebody in the chat room complain that I just derailed the show with my comment
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   terrorist.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   No, that's legitimate.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.280]   You don't like the phone because of the things on the screen.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   No, there's a bunch of things I don't like.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.000]   But I think I was being demeaned by the chat.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.960]   I think you should go spank.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.360]   Well, I think probably people funds your comments demeaning.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.760]   Well, I would hope so.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.560]   Fair enough.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.400]   All right.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.920]   Why do judges wear black robes?
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.000]   Apparently, just as I said, it's just tradition.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   You can wear where everyone.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.480]   In fact, one of the Supreme Court justices apparently once went on the Supreme Court
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   with no robe.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:22.360]   Well, William Renquist had gold stripes put on his cuffs because he saw it in a play and
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.880]   thought it looked cool.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.680]   And some people have gone out with red, white and blue robes.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.560]   So you could go out with a white robe.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.720]   Was Renquist a Nixon appointee?
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   Yes, he was.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.240]   Nixon's the guy who did you see that latest Nixon thing?
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   Yes, HBO.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   It's hilarious.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   Sure.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   Harry, sure.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   Is that it?
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.240]   No, no.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.760]   This is the one where they have all the whole movie is just Nixon clips of him talking the
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   recordings.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   Oh, I haven't seen them.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   Oh, my God.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   It's unbelievable.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   All right.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.440]   Anyway, so Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a piece on Smithsonian.com where she says that it seems
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.360]   like nobody really knows where it came from.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.800]   It seems like in the early days of the US, they decided that they didn't want the wigs
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.080]   like the English judges had.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.960]   And they had flashy outfits.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.640]   And so it was sort of frowned upon.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.440]   And by 1800, apparently, American judges were all sort of just settled on wearing black
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.760]   robes because they didn't want to be fancy like those bruts.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.920]   But it's OK to have gold stripes on this.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.880]   Well, that's her point is that you could wear anything you want.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.880]   But they don't.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.280]   Yeah, maybe in Hawaii, they wear like a--
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   Moo-moo's got to be hot.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.280]   Like a shorty robe.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   It's got to be hot.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.200]   Well, now I think we've all learned something here.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.200]   I think so.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.760]   That's the takeaway for my show.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.760]   Finally.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.800]   That's what you get.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   That's what I get.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.960]   Shouldn't have brought that one up.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   I'm the one abroad.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.120]   Hey, did Adam celebrate his 10th anniversary this week?
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.240]   You know, this is the 10th anniversary of the Daily Source Code this week.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.080]   He was actually very annoyed that I didn't know this.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.600]   Well, Matt, you should have come on the show last week and I could have prepared you.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.720]   Well, I didn't know this.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   So he was hurt.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720]   It was.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.400]   No, no, nobody says it was the first podcast.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   I don't think it was.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   I don't know if it was.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   I don't even know what the--
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.760]   The first podcast pre-dated that.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:07.360]   It was Christopher Leiden did a podcast while he was at Harvard.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:12.560]   And of course, our good friend Doug K did IT conversations with Dave Weiner.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.040]   I think who was on IT conversations?
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.600]   That was a couple of years.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:28.160]   But it was when Adam Curry started writing his iPod or software in 2004 and he then did
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.960]   the show, the Daily Source Code.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.440]   It was released first to August 12th, 2004 to talk to-- to say, "I've released this software
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   that will allow you to download stuff via RSS feeds, put it on your iPod.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.600]   It'll automatically be added to iTunes if you put it on your iPod."
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.400]   And in order to make this-- you know, you got to-- you got to have something to do.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.040]   So I'm going to make a show that I will distribute this way and then you'll have something to
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.720]   test the software out with.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.160]   And it was the Daily Source Code which he did for many years.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.160]   Still does, under--
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   Does he still do it?
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.160]   --randomly.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.320]   There's a really nice article on Ars Technica by--
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Ars did it.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.280]   By Sirus Farovar, who actually wrote the first-- I believe the first article to use the word
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.480]   podcast in the New York Times.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.480]   And then he wrote a big piece from Macworld on it when he worked at Macworld.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   He was a host of our first podcast back in the day.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.480]   Was he?
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.080]   So, yes, Sarus has been around, but he wrote a nice little podcast retrospective this week
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.080]   on Ars.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.680]   To celebrate 10 years since Daily Source Code, which I think many could say really is the
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.720]   first kind of commercial podcast that you could call a podcast.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.360]   It's hard to pick a date for when podcasts start.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.360]   That's as good a date as any.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.360]   Well, good for him.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.560]   Happy anniversary to podcasting.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.960]   We are, by the way, I'm quick to point out, not a podcast.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   You're a netcast.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.960]   I don't know what we are.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   From people who love.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   Well, that's one of the things--
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   That's true.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.960]   I like that.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.320]   I might want to change it to that.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.720]   Netcast you trust from people who love.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   Yes.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.120]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   It's good.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   It's good.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.400]   I mean, there's-- Sarus's story says nobody can relieve and define what it is or what
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.880]   it means or anything like that.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.440]   I always tell people it's like radio without the listeners.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.440]   You do that.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.440]   You do.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.440]   I like that.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.440]   You do incomparable.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.440]   You do several shows.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.960]   I do incomparable is like a network now.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.120]   So we've got a bunch of shows on there.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   And then I do--
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.400]   I do one called clockwise that we do on Tech Hives.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.560]   By the way, congratulations to the incomparable network.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.560]   Hi.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.560]   Thank you.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.800]   What else is on the-- so where is it?
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   incomparable.net?
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.840]   Yeah, the incomparable.com where you can go to incomparable.co.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.000]   It's shorter.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.040]   It's always a bunch of stuff.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.040]   There's this.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   We've got a Star Trek podcast.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   We've got a movie podcast.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   We've got a D&D podcast.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.040]   We've got a TV podcast.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.040]   And then the main one.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.040]   And this is fun.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.040]   This is all me.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.040]   And it's just nerdy stuff.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.040]   And it's a lot of fun.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.840]   You must spend all day doing podcasting.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.520]   I dream of that.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.800]   I don't currently do that.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   But it's--
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   It's not all.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   It's correct.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   I bet.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   Oh, no.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   We should talk.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   I mean, you know, this is great.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   This is how I guess--
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   You want to do a merger acquisition?
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   I want to do an M&A.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   I'm right down the road.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   We could just--
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   Put them all together.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   We should all together.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   Which is the best of these six?
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   The incomparable is awesome.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   Oh, and the most of the other shows.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   Oh, actually I've heard that.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   Yeah, I just do it.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.280]   But these are all good shows.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   It's a cool--
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.480]   In any event, Adam Curry and John C. Devoir continue to host a show twice a week called
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.480]   No Agenda.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.640]   Yeah, twice a week.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   So--
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.200]   Yeah, and Adam still does DSC every once in a while.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   That's the one with--
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.840]   Well, there's a $10 million worth of airplanes strapped to my butt.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.840]   I don't know.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.840]   I don't want to listen to that show.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   It's a music show.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   He's playing music.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   His favorite kind of music.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   Oh, I see.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.840]   That's different.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   That's like new technology where you don't know whether it's going to affect your health
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   afterward.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.600]   But you know at least that you can host a podcast more or less for 10 years and still
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.040]   be alive and doing podcasts.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.440]   This is Adam Curry-Pruzant.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.200]   Steve Jobs on the stage of all things D. You'll recognize, of course, Cara Swisher and Walt
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.200]   Mossberg.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   This is on 2005.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   That's the idea of the classic.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   That's the idea of this update.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   That's the idea.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   That's the idea of the podcast.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   That's the idea of the podcast.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   That's the idea of the podcast.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   That's the idea of the podcast.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.400]   And I think what we're going to see is an advertising supported model emerged just like
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   free radio.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   Yep.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   Here's another.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.800]   Adam Curry is one of the guys that invented podcasting.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.080]   And he has a podcast called The Daily Source.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.960]   Let me go ahead and subscribe to that.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.840]   And we can go listen to his latest one.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.840]   Just click on it.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.600]   On your daily source code, show number 180.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.240]   Something remarkable is happening here.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.040]   Radio is springing free of the regulated gatekeepers who've managed what you can hear
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.000]   since radio was invented.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.280]   It's jumping into the hands of anyone at all with something or nothing to say.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.920]   With $60 million worth of airplanes strapped to my ass.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.280]   The next generation of radio content in my ears.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.840]   We don't need no D.I.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.240]   I like to think I'm flying into this door.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   Podcasting kids.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   Adam Curry.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   That's right.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   It's show number one.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   Steve Singh.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.240]   It's Friday, everybody.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   Who do I find?
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.360]   I've actually had to restart the show three times.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.040]   My Mac has been acting up like a mother.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:10.000]   I think it's something to do with the file system.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Okay.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   How do you?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Yeah, good timing.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.240]   How do you control, say, dirty stuff?
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.240]   I mean...
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.680]   Alright, thank you, Garrett.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.840]   You don't.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.960]   Steve's got to wonder, didn't anybody listen to this show before I played it?
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.880]   Steve, you're supposed to click 107.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880]   Whatever.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   Anyway.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.440]   He was supposed to open the disclosure triangle and click the specified episode.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   Right.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   He just double clicked on the podcast.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   Wait, whatever.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   He's seriously...
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.440]   He got what he wanted.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.120]   In that intro to the podcast saying that it's not under the control since it has been since
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.480]   the inception of radio, it's not true.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.080]   Their inception of radio, which was in the early 1900s, was a free for all.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.720]   People were broadcasting wherever they wanted, wherever they wanted.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.920]   As is often the case with a new medium, there's nobody paying attention.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   Right.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   Until there's money.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   Right.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.000]   Which is going to happen in podcasting too.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.520]   The good news is, Jason, what's this?
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.400]   There's no money in podcasting.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   That's not true.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   You making good money.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   I'm not podcasting.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.400]   You know, I had this conversation...
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.400]   You know, I had this conversation...
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.680]   I had this conversation with Mike Elgin.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.960]   What is podcasting versus what we do?
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.760]   And I think Mike and I came up with it.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.840]   Mike came up with a notion that it's really...
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.720]   Podcasting is the hobbyist broadcaster.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.120]   Somebody who is not trying to emulate broadcasting, not trying to emulate radio, but just having
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.880]   fun talk about something they care about.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.480]   That's a podcast.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.320]   It's basically fundamentally amateur.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.960]   What we're doing is much more like traditional broadcasting.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.520]   This is more like a television studio.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   Yeah, but it's fuzzy.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.320]   I mean, I make money with you and I'm comfortable.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.320]   I've got ads.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.880]   Mike Hurley, who used to be on 5x5, is starting his own relay, his own network.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.560]   I'm thrilled to hear that, by the way.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.640]   And he's hoping to make a go at it.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.800]   And I think it can be done.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.840]   There is...some of it is about the business, whether it's a business or not.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.120]   Some of it is about the...what the program is.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.560]   Because a lot of podcasts you're right are people talking about things they love.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.520]   I was listening to a podcast the other week and I was really taken aback.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.160]   I reacted badly to it and it wasn't a bad podcast.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.800]   It's just the way it was put together.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.080]   It felt like an AM radio show.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.640]   And I felt kind of offended because like this isn't a podcast.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640]   But it is, obviously.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.480]   It is, but it's like...I had started to think podcast meant a very personal sort of like
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   people having conversations.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.480]   That's what I think.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   I think you'd ever hear on the radio.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.560]   Personal hobbyist.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.840]   And what we do, I think, is more trying to bring experts on to discuss stuff.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.840]   It's podcasting.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   Well, internet broadcasting.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.840]   There's no you got no antenna.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.840]   As far as I'm concerned.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.640]   Oh, so if it doesn't have an antenna, it's a podcast.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   As far as I'm concerned.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.840]   So, naturally, it's a podcast.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.840]   You know, this kind of third degree is not the new podcast.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   Or is it the new black?
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.840]   It's a great video podcast.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.840]   It's a fun podcast.
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.480]   I love oranges and new blankets.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.560]   They've really taken it to the next level.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.560]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.560]   They've been well taken.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   I have to now reassess.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   Reassess.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.800]   Pull back and I'll come back with some.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.680]   Come back with a better...I'm going to give you a minute to think, while I talk about
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.520]   Stamps.com.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   Great operation.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.520]   Great operation.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.000]   Really replacing the post office.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Actually, no!
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.720]   No, that's the wrong way to think of it.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.160]   It's not replacing the post office.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.960]   In fact, post office loves Stamps.com.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.720]   It just means you don't have to go to the post office.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   It means that if you do mailing professionally in your business, you can do it more professionally
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720]   with Stamps.com.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.400]   You can do it at your desk using your computer, your printer.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.000]   Imagine instead of licking and putting a stamp on an envelope when you send out a bill
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.080]   or a brochure or a mailer, you actually print right on the envelope with your corporate
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.840]   logo, your return address automatically filled in the address of the recipient, automatically
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.760]   filled in from your QuickBooks or your website.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.240]   You're sending packages, no problems.
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.840]   Stamps.com has a USB scale.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.480]   You pop the package on there.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.760]   Prints out exactly the right postage again if you want with your logo.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:53.160]   If you're sending a mail like a Priority Mail or Express Mail, they'll automatically send
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.520]   an email to the recipient with the tracking number.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.280]   It's very pro.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:04.040]   When postage rates change, unlike a postage meter, you don't have to pay extra to get
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.040]   the upgrade.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.080]   The Stamps.com does it automatically.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.360]   No extra charge.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.920]   It's also, by the way, you get discounts you can't get at the post office, including insurance.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.760]   You get discounted package insurance just by clicking a button.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.400]   No more head-written forms.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.880]   Certified mail, return receipt, international customs mail automatically filled out.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.120]   It really is fantastic.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.480]   If you're doing mailing in your business, you must have a Stamps.com account.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.040]   I'm going to make it easy for you.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.120]   When you visit Stamps.com, click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.560]   Use our offer code TWIT.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.800]   We'll set you up with a $110 no risk trial.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:43.680]   It includes that digital scale so you don't ever have to worry about putting too much or
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.960]   too little postage on your packages.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.840]   You get $55 in free postage.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.720]   You can use over the first few months of your account.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.840]   You get an activities kit and, of course, a 30-day trial of Stamps.com.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:59.000]   Seriously, if you're in business and you're doing mailing, visit Stamps.com.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.280]   Click the microphone.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.280]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.640]   It really will change your attitude towards mailing.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.680]   Your clients, your customers, they'll really appreciate it.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.680]   It's fabulous.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.680]   www.stamps.com.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.480]   A little leak coming out of Best Buy.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.000]   We've been very interested in these.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.960]   I've been wearing the Android Wear watches as the LG Samsung makes one.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.960]   But they're square.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   They're ugly.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.960]   They're bulky.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.720]   We've been waiting to hear about the Moto 360.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.440]   Best Buy leaked it out.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.200]   $249 according to Best Buy.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.760]   Listing on their site for the Moto 360, they gave it all the specs as well.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.760]   Nothing unusual.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:42.520]   I wouldn't expect one and a half inch backlit LCD touchscreen, 205 pixels per inch, Gorilla
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.400]   Glass 3.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.480]   The thing about Android Wear is the software is the same on all of these watches.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.520]   It's really all about hardware-formed factor.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.800]   I like the idea of round.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:59.160]   Motorola is going to have a press event in Chicago on September 4, five days before Apple's
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:03.840]   press event, which I should go because I'm a big fan of the Moto X.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.520]   It's my favorite fan.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.320]   Chicago's fun.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.760]   Chicago's great this time of year.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   Nice and sweaty.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.760]   Not a good idea.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.760]   But that's exciting.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.840]   I think we're going to see both whatever the successor to the Moto X is, the Moto G and
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.600]   the Moto 360 watch on September 4.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.600]   Do you agree?
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.880]   I think it's a lot of us are skeptical about the fact that the bottom part of the little
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.800]   circle screen is missing.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.320]   What do you mean missing?
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.200]   There's a little flat part where the screen doesn't continue.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.760]   It's there, but it's not part of the screen.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.400]   It doesn't show data.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.920]   Right down the bottom is like a flat tire.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.480]   And I keep thinking that if I was wearing that watch, that would drive me crazy knowing
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.400]   that the whole circle isn't drawable.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.080]   There's a little flat part down at the bottom.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.120]   That's like there's some electronic stuff there.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.200]   Yeah, because they can't fit a whole screen there.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.000]   What goes there?
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Nothing.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   But I see something.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.480]   They mentioned that that's like, yeah, part of the digitizer in this screen assembly.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.000]   That they cannot create a full circle.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.360]   Let me go to the actual site because you know, this isn't much of a leak since they've had
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.480]   the website, Moto 360.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   Motorola that come up for some time.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.480]   This is still a Google company.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.720]   I don't know when this is going to become Lenovo.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.160]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.560]   That black, that crescent at the bottom there.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   You could show this screen.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   There you go.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.560]   All right.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.560]   Well, we'll see.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.560]   Maybe I will hate it.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.360]   I didn't notice that till you told me.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.800]   Well, it's just a matter of time before you hate everything.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.640]   Wait, wait, that's your route for you.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.640]   But I love it all.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.640]   I know.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   I love it all.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   I'm good to go right to get go.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   Are you going to buy that?
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.240]   You were you made it from the beginning?
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.480]   Yes, you work your way to hate.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.400]   John feels the way we all will feel.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.920]   Someday too, you'll hate this.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.920]   I hate this.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.520]   There's a lot of time.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.520]   I don't know what the...
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.520]   I tell we were.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.520]   I tell I were.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.520]   I don't know if I'm going to say.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   You've got to watch on.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   I'm going to buy.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.520]   I think it's going to look good.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.520]   Because it is nice to get in.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520]   I buy them all.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.520]   It's my job, dude.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.920]   This is the dude.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   This is the one.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.920]   Not just a watch.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   Well, it is.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.800]   And look, I can't do anything with it.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.720]   I mean, I'm definitely...
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   Is that the pebble, Leo?
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.520]   No, I had the pebble.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.640]   Chad has my pebble.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   This is the Android Wear.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.640]   Here's the...
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   I got my pebble.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   Which is two men.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   Two men.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.200]   Don't zoom in and enhance.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   Over here.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.200]   I can zoom in over here.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.200]   What do you want to show?
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.200]   Hello, Google.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.200]   Zoom in.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   Okay, Google.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   Apparently somebody...
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   How did you get?
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.200]   Where did you get this?
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.680]   Where did you get that thing?
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.520]   This is what you normally see.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.240]   And then if a text message comes in or whatever, it'll fill this ring.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:45.160]   If you do a circle and then a line and the sign of the cross, that other screen comes
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   up.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   I don't know what you got there.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.760]   I can do it again if you want.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   Okay.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:55.640]   I mean, the problem with the Wear is, I mean, remember when Windows Mobile literally had
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.680]   a start menu on it?
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.760]   It just feels a little too Android on the wrist.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:09.440]   That said, I've been trying to make a conscious effort to spend less time on my phone, particularly
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.000]   being with family and stuff like that.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.160]   And I would love to just take it off and put it in my bag and not even have my pocket,
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.880]   but then I'll never actually hear it.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.240]   Well, that's the funny thing about this.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.840]   It almost always results in me pulling the phone out.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.840]   Wow, but that's...
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.080]   I don't know what I've saved really.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.080]   So I love the idea of being able to...
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:30.440]   I think one of the criticisms of Wear is it's hard to really limit who you get stuff from.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:36.440]   But I think once that's in place, I mean, just for that reason alone, it sounds really
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.400]   having something I think is...
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.800]   Sounds quite compelling to me.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:44.960]   One of the reasons I do wear all these is I'm trying to find out what the real experience
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   is.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.760]   And generally, I would say nobody needs any of this stuff.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.360]   No, I mean, for me, I'm still wearing a pebble a year later.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.600]   And for me, it's all about the notifications.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.600]   I like...
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   Where is it?
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   Right here?
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.600]   Oh, that's it.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.280]   I like the fact that it's...
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.840]   I don't have to take out my phone sometimes because I see who the text is from.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.520]   This is like a responded text.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.360]   Not only a respond, but a respond with your voice.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.360]   That does a very...
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.360]   Would that take it out the phone?
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   Very nice.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.440]   The other thing too is light product.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.440]   Is it lighter than this?
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.960]   No, it doesn't have any weight at all.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.040]   Well, let's see, compared to that.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.280]   Is that more substantial?
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   Well, yes.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.280]   Yes, by a light.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   I mean, it's a couple more for...
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   You have a couple more for him.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   He's a master of standards and balances, yes.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   I can do that.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.280]   It's not a touch screen.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.200]   The other thing is for people...
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:42.680]   I think the kind of underappreciated thing for watches in general is, I think women in
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.880]   general more likely to have their phone in a bag.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.560]   And for that reason, I think the notification aspect is more compelling.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.160]   I think I certainly have that issue trying to get home with my wife.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.160]   But I think that's what makes what's...
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.080]   I radically know women wants to wear these because they're so ugly and clunky.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.080]   Yes, exactly.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.080]   That's what women have to taste.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.040]   They're really missing the point right now.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.760]   And I think that's going to be the...
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.520]   If the Outwatch comes out, I think that's going to be what's really interesting about
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.520]   it.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.920]   I wonder if it is going to be very explicitly marketed to women.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:17.400]   I think Apple's products have traditionally been more popular with women than with men.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   And when I think...
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   Wait, did you say that again?
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   I used to say that.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   Products are more popular with women than men.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   He nailed it.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   Is that true?
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   Yeah, I think that's true.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   And I think he's got...
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.400]   I mean, women...
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.040]   Women, a lot of times, don't have their phones in their pockets.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.400]   They've got them in a bag somewhere.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.760]   And so they don't even know if their phone is ringing.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.760]   They can't do anything from remove.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.480]   You're fortunate if you're a guy and you've got it right there in your pocket.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.640]   So I think it'll have more appeal.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:44.760]   And that's why I like what I use the Pebble for is literally like, do I really need to
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.920]   look at my phone for this?
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.400]   Oh, no, I don't.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.040]   Or I can use it as a remote control.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.600]   But really mostly it's just, do I need to...
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.760]   Is this text important or not?
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.760]   And it's not.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.760]   I can just...
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:00.440]   Yeah, thing too, and this gets into the whole like, phablet thing is here in Asia, it's
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.440]   which is Apple's future.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.880]   It's the future of every tech company.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.800]   It's much more common for men to carry bags.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:13.960]   So in that particular case, I think it's even more compelling for the reasons compelling
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.960]   to women everywhere.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.160]   I think it's also compelling to men here.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.000]   It could be.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.360]   Why do men more often carry bags in Taiwan?
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.360]   Is that just cultural day?
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.360]   They were...
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.360]   It's a tight pants.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.360]   It's probably a cultural thing.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.560]   I think it's also you...
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.560]   Tight pants.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   Tight pants.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.280]   Well, you take public transportation more often.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.960]   People might write skaters like that.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:36.960]   It's just...
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   But it's more acceptable.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.240]   Quite frankly, it's quite nice.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.720]   I embrace the MERS.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.760]   I actually have a MERS.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.760]   You have a MERS?
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.760]   Of course I do.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.760]   Can you show us your MERS?
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.760]   Yeah, let's see.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.360]   Ewingian Jones has one.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.360]   It's sitting up by the door.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.360]   See, that's the problem with MERS.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   Or MERS is.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   They're never wearing either.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.360]   It's by the door.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.360]   Oh, I know.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.360]   It's by the door.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.360]   I don't know what I want to know.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.360]   Exactly.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   He runs out.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   It's a satchel.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.360]   I feel like actually...
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.440]   There's one more thing too is that I have so many keys.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.120]   There's very complicated doorways here.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.920]   And just not having all the bulk in your pocket, it's quite nice.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.720]   I feel like in fact, the MERS is very similar to the MERS.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.720]   The smart watch.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   I am stunned.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.360]   Stunned that you don't use a MERS.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   Teri MERS.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.800]   Much like the smart watch, I keep trying to want to like it.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:28.480]   I understand the utility and the value of it.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.960]   And I just can't...
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.160]   After a while I just give up.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.160]   What did he do?
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.160]   Did he start your phone?
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.160]   He did.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.160]   He turned on my podcasting app.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.400]   I come across the table.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.400]   It was an accident.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.400]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:47.200]   I should have worn you.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.200]   It's happened to the best of us.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.600]   I should have turned off Bluetooth, but I didn't.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.600]   My mistake.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:59.480]   Twitter's changing the way the world works for verified users.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:06.000]   You can now say whether you're going to see tweets from other verified users or the unwashed
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   masses.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.520]   Twitter says it's just...
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.880]   What we want is we want the verified users to interact with one another.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:12.880]   This is elitism.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.480]   It is absolutely elitism because Twitter realizes that most people use Twitter don't post much.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:22.960]   Or if they do, they post useless silly stuff that's really only for their friends and that
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.520]   the celebrities are the ones who really make Twitter valuable.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.320]   So they're to them, to Twitter, to the stockholders.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.200]   Well, should they worry about it?
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.200]   Twitter's not worried about you.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.000]   Well, I'm not verified.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.640]   Well, there you go.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.960]   Now would you turn that on that you only see...
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   No, never.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   No.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.960]   Because you're a man.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.960]   I think people.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   I am a man of the people.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.240]   I think that's a little short.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.000]   I think that's a little short term though.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.600]   I think in the long run, Twitter's goal is to have most people verified.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.480]   And the reason is because if you can guarantee that's a particular person, you can build
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.160]   a profile on them and they're more valuable to advertisers.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.640]   So I think this is more putting infrastructure in place.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.040]   I think their goal in the long run is that everyone has a blue check.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.920]   At least everyone, that's a real person.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:08.960]   And then with the real Jeff Jarvis, not the professor Jeff Jarvis.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   Poor Jeff.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.560]   And we'll talk about it.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:16.000]   Of course Jeff is one of the hosts of this week in Google every Wednesday on the Network.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.920]   He has been really going off about this professor Jeff Jarvis, who quite...
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   It's a parody.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:28.240]   It's a parody, except that he started saying nasty things about a colleague who didn't
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.800]   know the difference and blamed Jeff Jarvis for it.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   Yeah, biting parody.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.800]   That's where it works.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   The problem I have with the...
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   Good night.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.200]   Professor Jeff Jarvis is that he doesn't seem to be directly parodying Jeff Jarvis as well
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.040]   as much as it is like a whole broad cross-section.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.840]   Well, talking about him complaining, I want to bring something up.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.800]   Do you remember when you did a show with David Pogue, who was blaming me for writing
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.600]   some nasty thing because he was busted for...
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.040]   It was at the old cottage.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.880]   And Pogue was going on and on and on about, "Oh, Dvorak said this, Dvorak said that."
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.600]   But it wasn't the real Dvorak.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   It was some point...
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   Interesting.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   Don't you remember this?
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   I do remember this.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   Yes.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600]   Coming back to me now.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.600]   And I had to clarify this and he had the same thing that he was suffering from.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.600]   This happens.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.320]   Twitter doesn't seem to give us very good ways to prevent this from happening.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.320]   They've been coming under a lot of attack.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.680]   Robin Williams' daughter, Sad, had to leave Twitter because she was getting so horrifically
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.120]   trolled.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.160]   Their stories again and again of Twitter just not...
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.960]   Actually, because it's a celebrity's daughter, now they might be doing something about it.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.480]   But there were a lot of complaints just a couple of weeks earlier about trolls on Twitter.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.520]   And the harassment on Twitter either doesn't meet their standards or they don't respond
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.520]   when you report it.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.240]   They're not very cooperative.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.880]   But I also understand what a difficult position that puts them in because then they become
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.280]   judge and jury.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.680]   Is this parody?
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.160]   Is this a troll?
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.400]   I mean, Professor Jeff Jarvis is...
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.400]   You could...
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.400]   Well, the content has...
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.400]   You're making music.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.640]   The content isn't the problem.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.080]   The content is...
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.680]   It's the mistaken identity that's the problem, right?
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.640]   The assuming somebody else's identity.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.880]   Now apparently the professor that the parody account was making fun of didn't know enough
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.440]   to look just for the verified check mark.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.280]   Well, let me be a contrarian on two points.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   Okay, good.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.440]   One, the Professor Jeff Jarvis account is really funny.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   Like...
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.440]   I agree.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.440]   In his point of view.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.760]   Out of respect to Jeff, I don't follow it.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   I agree.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   Well, he doesn't...
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760]   He doesn't...
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.760]   It's not a parody of Jeff Jarvis's parody of all the Silicon Valley, like over...
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.440]   Like I talk about the whole changing the world thing and all that sort of stuff.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   It's very funny.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.680]   Like he's taking on and...
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.880]   Well, his most recent tweet...
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   What honestly?
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.840]   The sermon on the mount was the first TED talk.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   That's funny.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840]   I like it.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.120]   Like most parody accounts, I follow it for a couple of days and I unfollow it.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.680]   They actually end up being as funny as the retweet that I saw.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.600]   Like he's one of the few that I've followed for a long time because he's consistently quite
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:56.800]   good and it really does skewer the valley kind of mindset in a very distinct sort of way.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.320]   I kind of wish he didn't use Jeff Jarvis's name because he's actually...
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320]   You're right.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.640]   It's very funny.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.280]   And if he had Professor Jerry Jarvis...
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.600]   Or if he was fake Jeff Jarvis.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.880]   Or even just fake Jeff Jarvis, this would be fine.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.880]   Hyper-glocal...
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.320]   Hyper-glocal think fluency.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   Thank you, sir.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.680]   Journalism 3.0 advocate, co-founder at Mogadishu Reinvent Unconference.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:26.520]   Inventor CIO and chief-imagineer at Nextify Labs on workspace.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.120]   This is actually awesome.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.120]   And his hyperlink is to app.net.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120]   That kills me every time.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.120]   I love that.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.120]   The anti-Twitter.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.680]   Well, so my other objection though is...
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.720]   I mean, just to be...
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.240]   It's super explicit.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.440]   I mean, what happened is Aldo Williams is terrible and I certainly understand where Jeff
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.360]   Jarvis is coming from.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.200]   At the same time, what's been dominating the news this week has been what's happening in
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.600]   Ferguson.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:00.520]   And in that community in particular, there is a whole thing called Black Twitter.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:07.920]   Like Twitter has really given a voice to an a view on what's happening here that if this
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.400]   had happened 10 years ago, like there would be a one-sided story.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.360]   Like there would be one side of the story coming out.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.720]   It probably wouldn't even be a big deal.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.400]   And you get all this stuff, there's good with bad.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.480]   The bad is you have this abuse going on and it's terrible and it absolutely needs to be
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   dealt with.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.720]   But we need to be careful not to do the baby with a bathwater sort of thing because the
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.080]   same mechanic that makes abuse possible also makes the marginalized, the people who have
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.600]   never had a voice, gives them a voice, lets them...
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.040]   West them get things out that weren't out previously.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.480]   And that's a really great thing.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.440]   And I think it's really easy to over-index on one or two examples and to forget about
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.600]   the good side, just as it's good to over-focus on good stuff and not appreciate the bad stuff
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   that goes with it.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.760]   I mean, everything's a trade-off.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.000]   And I think in Twitter in particular this week, it's been really striking to have these
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.520]   kind of totally opposite narratives happening without realizing they're actually two sides
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.760]   of the same coin.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.760]   Very well put.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.680]   And it does put Twitter in a very difficult position because you want to foster the kind
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.040]   of things that are happening out of Ferguson.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.440]   And we've seen it again and again, it happened out of Cairo, it happened out of Istanbul.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.920]   I mean, this is Twitter's amazing power.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.400]   But it's very powerful and it can be used against people as well.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.320]   And the thing is a lot of that power, like you talk about the things in Cairo, even the
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.960]   things in Ferguson, like there is a story in the New York Times about Twitter and the
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.080]   effects it's had.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.440]   And there was this quote from the head of police, basically saying, "Oh, they use Twitter."
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.440]   It was very...
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.440]   Wow.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:50.280]   It was very bothersome, but the idea is as soon as we get an idea of Twitter should control,
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.200]   it's only a small step to the government should get Twitter to control.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:58.080]   And then it's like, "Well, okay, so where is that line being drawn?"
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.880]   And again, I am not at all saying that what happened to Zalto Williams is or to women
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.880]   everywhere.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.760]   What happens to women on Twitter is terrible.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760]   It's horrendous.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.360]   And Twitter, I think, does need to figure out some solutions.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.880]   But I think there's certainly a...
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.320]   Everyone should appreciate and be thoughtful about what's happening because it cuts both
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.320]   ways.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:29.720]   There's a lot of censorship/wimiting, objectionable speech.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.560]   There's a very thin line there.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.240]   And I can appreciate Twitter's hesitation.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.920]   And I think people who push on one side also need to be confident of what's happening
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   on the other.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.200]   And that goes for people who have so well celebrated it too.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200]   It's a really good point.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.120]   Twitter does provide one tool that anybody can use, just the block tool.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   And I block people.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.560]   Well, actually they've changed it now.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.400]   So it's a double.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.120]   You can also squelch and block.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.920]   You can view people, you can block people there.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.400]   They've advanced it so now you can also report them and you can send nasty...
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.800]   You get a page that's abusive, you can send the page in.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.640]   But the problem is, I think some of these harassers, like they open up...
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.640]   This happened to Zalto Williams.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.640]   They open up thousands of accounts.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:15.880]   It's impossible to block somebody permanently because they just create a new account.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:19.440]   Well, after they want to go through all that effort, it's easier to block than it is to
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   create the account.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.440]   So I'd go for the block.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.280]   Well, Glenn Fleischman wrote a piece on Boing Boing this week about these collaborative
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   block tools.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   And that's an interesting way to be scary.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280]   It's sad, I'm a stick.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.680]   But it's an interesting idea where you really have a community trying to do things because
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.920]   they feel like Twitter is not able to help them.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920]   The Blacklist.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.040]   And Jeff Jarvis has been very pro on this Blacklist.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:43.240]   But I have to point out that the one Blacklist has been created, President Obama and Lady
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.240]   Gaga, as well as...
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.080]   Well, it's a cautionary tale in a way because what it's saying is that you can have a block
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.640]   list, but any block list is going to have the biases of the community that's policing
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   it.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.480]   And so in this case, there are some very specific kinds of political arguments that are not
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.480]   even the opposite.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.040]   It's like not quite orthodox that get blocked.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.960]   But it shows that there's a need for this sort of thing out there.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.960]   Which was the need of it.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.960]   It shows the danger, right?
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:12.560]   I mean, because as soon as you get into this area, it's the law of unintended consequences.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.480]   And it will always rear its head.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.480]   And again, I don't have the solution.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.360]   I think probably the most interesting one I've heard is the idea that you should be able
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.240]   to block @mentions from newly created accounts.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.920]   And which I think would possibly make sense.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:32.360]   But as soon as you get into any of these areas, stuff's going to happen.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.440]   And that's the...
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.920]   It's not just Twitter, it's the internet in general.
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.320]   I mean, the internet is the most open sort of thing.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.320]   And that's awesome.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.320]   It's great.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.720]   It's what I do be possible.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:47.680]   And also what's terrible things happen as well.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:53.760]   And it's not an easy solution to anyone who thinks that it is on either direction, is
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.960]   doing kind of the whole medium of the service.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.560]   No, I think you're very well said.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.560]   I think you're right.
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.560]   It's clearly challenging.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.480]   I don't know if there's what the right answer is.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.400]   Right answers to shut it down.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.400]   Shut it down.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.960]   There's some people that think that.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.760]   It's pretty amazing what Twitter has become.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.760]   I have to say, it is...
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.760]   It's just by the state department.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.560]   I don't think cause trouble overseas for one day.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.520]   It's used by everybody to do everything.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.000]   It's like the internet.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.360]   Well, Ferguson's a great example where we wouldn't know what was happening in Ferguson.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.600]   Well, it wouldn't have sprung up somewhere else.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.960]   Wouldn't it have happened on Facebook or somewhere else?
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   Possibly.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.000]   But although Facebook, the point there is Facebook filters, your tweets or your status
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.640]   updates and Twitter, there's much more word of mouth.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:40.040]   And that first night of riots in Ferguson where the police were shooting rubber bullets
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.200]   at people and tear gassing people, the TV networks weren't there.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.320]   They weren't on and Twitter was reporting the news live, including by journalists as
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.400]   well as people on the ground.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.680]   And you got that moment and this has happened every now and then where you realize, wow,
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.080]   Twitter is doing a better job at this story and the mainstream media is not doing as good
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.480]   a job on it.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.160]   And that happened because of the Ferguson hashtag and it happened because there was
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.160]   nobody in control.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.920]   And to Ben's point, it also happened because there was no policy that allows, say, a police
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.960]   department to suppress accounts for illegal activity, which would probably have been abused
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.280]   in that situation to shut down the people in Ferguson yet.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.280]   Thank you.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.280]   Again, John has moved all the way to hate.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:23.280]   John, are you going to sign this document?
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.600]   Because I can't allow you into our studios unless you do.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.040]   I was really stunned that you have this document.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.040]   Why are you stunned?
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.600]   Every one of these people, these good, you all signed this document.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.400]   Did you not protecting us from liability?
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.600]   Don't they look like a litigious bunch?
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.120]   No, I wonder you have the audience is shrunk.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.280]   No, we've been having signed that for years.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.280]   Really?
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.800]   It just says you won't sue us.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800]   And yeah, I know.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.920]   I understand what it says.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.720]   I've been stunned because I thought that mostly knew it seems like some lawyer got into
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.720]   the apparatus.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720]   Totally a lawyer got into it.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.360]   It was written by a lawyer.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.080]   But mostly it's to warn you that you're in a working studio.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.520]   There are wires on the floor and there are hazards and you should be aware of the fact
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.120]   that this is going to be a hazard.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.360]   For people who don't know what we're talking about, I guess.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.360]   This is a liability waiver.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.200]   This is an important document, read carefully, a waiver of liability.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.680]   So if you come to the tweet operation.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.840]   You can't sue us afterwards.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.920]   You have to sign off on this.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.920]   I think that's fair.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.920]   I don't think it's unfair.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:20.920]   I mean, it's very common.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   We did that at TechTales.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.680]   I was just stunned that you'd gone along with this sort of--
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.680]   You know, the only reason?
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.840]   You're a credit crap.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.800]   I'll tell you why it happened.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.280]   Somebody fell.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:35.720]   He got tangled up in the headphones and he fell and he injured himself fairly severely.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.160]   Was taken to the hospital.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   Wow.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.080]   He broke his knee or something.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.560]   This is great.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.560]   And he was fine.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.120]   He was a big fan.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.720]   But we then started getting calls from his insurance company.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.600]   And of course, that's the problem is you guys wouldn't sue us, but your insurance company
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.600]   sure as hell would.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.960]   You know what they're doing.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.600]   And so this is really as much for them as it is for you.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.600]   OK.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.600]   And that's unfortunate.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.600]   Yeah, what if a light drops on my head?
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.600]   Somebody asks.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.600]   You've got no recourse.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   You're screwed.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.600]   I get throws on it.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.840]   Actually, I don't think you can sign a piece of paper that really gets us.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:08.840]   No, that's true.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:09.840]   It's just so hard.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.840]   I mean, if you get it by a light--
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   Laser bogus.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.840]   No, like, if there's gross, I think if there's like gross, neglected--
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   You can still--
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.640]   You acknowledge when you come in here that this is an active and functioning studio in
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.600]   office with a broad range of equipment, wiring, and furniture.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.200]   There is a lot of crap here.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200]   You should--
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.440]   I should read this and you should rewrite this in plain English.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.440]   There's not a crap.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.920]   It is a crap.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.920]   And wired.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.920]   Guest acknowledges the activities are inherently dangerous.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.960]   Apparently they don't know what a gaffer is.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.360]   And fully realizing the dangers of participating in the activities fully assumes the risks
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   associated with--
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.360]   You will die.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.040]   And by the way, they do define activities as each and every activity arising from or
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.000]   related to the visit.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   The visit.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.720]   It's like a name of a movie.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.880]   Well, the visit is your desire to visit and tour the brick house.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.080]   We call that the visit.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.840]   I think that was an episode of Under the Dome.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:05.840]   It goes on.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.840]   I actually started a dramatic reading and then I have this--
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:12.120]   I'm like, do it as a German.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.640]   I shall eat section six, severability.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.600]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600]   Oh.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600]   No.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.080]   You know, why is Boeing Boeing looking more like medium, by the way?
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.640]   Well, they went to a new design that is long form.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640]   They're focusing on long form.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640]   Looks just like medium.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640]   It does look a lot like medium.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   I don't like it.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.240]   I like the old Boeing Boeing.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.960]   I like the old Boeing Boeing.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960]   I think they--
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.960]   Side blog.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.800]   I think it wasn't working for them.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.800]   Internet of--
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.800]   Internet of--
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.760]   It was a compendium of interesting things or something like that.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.760]   [SIGH]
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.160]   Well, as a sign of the time--
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160]   At some of these times--
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.760]   Somebody says, we should sue for an interesting twit.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760]   Very funny.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   Oh, thank you.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760]   Very funny.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.760]   [SCREAM]
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:57.160]   By the way, at no point during the visit are you guaranteed anything of interest to happen.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.680]   It says that right here.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.680]   No, it does say that.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.560]   I believe that's on the websites terms of service too.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.240]   This may or may not entertain.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.320]   As a sign of the times, Facebook is going to start flagging satirical articles--
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.320]   Oh, geez.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:18.080]   --as satire because so many people reshare them as true.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.360]   Now on when you share-- it's a pilot project, but I can guarantee you this is going to spread
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.440]   and I think it's about time.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.680]   The old satire hashtag.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.040]   The satire hashtag.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.520]   You will see-- this is a Facebook spokesperson told Zarg's Technica.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:36.200]   We are running a small test which shows the text in brackets satire in front of links to
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.200]   satirical articles.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.200]   Extra funny when it's--
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.120]   This is like the guys who can't write an April Fool's column without the warning at
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.120]   the beginning of the column.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.120]   This is April.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:51.520]   You know the real culprit here is a great, I think, column in the New Yorker called the
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.520]   Borowitz report.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:58.240]   Andy Borowitz writes satire for the New Yorker, but it's satire that cuts so close to the bone
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.040]   that it often seems like it could be true like this article, millionaires unite to defeat
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.160]   minimum wage.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160]   That sounds plausible.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.160]   Yeah, it does sound real.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.480]   That sounds like a real possibility.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:18.720]   John Travolta apparently screwed up Ukrainian-- Ukraine calling it "Cranium" and Crimea calling
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720]   it "IKEA."
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.240]   I can see him doing that.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.480]   Well, because of the Oscars.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.960]   Because of the Oscars.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.040]   Anyway, I think it's--
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:31.720]   Well, the people that use Facebook get an out day in and day out are susceptible to this
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:32.720]   sort of thing.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.560]   They should be-- I don't know what this--
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.920]   I hate to say I sort of see some value with it, but if you've got an audience that doesn't
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.720]   understand these things.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.080]   And when you're reposting, it loses some of the context and you're reaching people who
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.640]   don't get it.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.800]   It's also the case, and we know this, people reshare without reading.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.800]   Certainly.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.800]   There are studies--
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.800]   Yes.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   Studies that show that most shared things--
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.800]   They read the headline.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.800]   They go, oh, you've got to see this.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.800]   They never read the article.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.960]   You've got to have my experience of not reading this article.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.360]   I don't have time to read the article.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.280]   I'm just going to share it.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:11.680]   Matt Honan in another interesting experiment decided to like everything he saw on "Feminine
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.680]   Facebook" for two days.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.160]   I'm one of his Facebook friends.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160]   Wait, is it live?
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.960]   Everybody is like, Matt, what is-- did you get hacked again?
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:18.960]   Are you OK?
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:19.960]   Did you go broke?
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   Did you have a stroke?
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.640]   Did you go off your medication?
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.640]   What happened?
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.640]   Because he liked everything.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.040]   And so there's like Matt Honan likes crazy things.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.440]   And it all gets in your stream.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.040]   Not all but some, right?
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.040]   And mine.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.200]   Some of it leads through.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.120]   And then his stream becomes completely insane.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.120]   He says my news--
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.120]   He's my favorite thing.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.560]   --took on an entirely new character in a surprisingly short amount of time after
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.920]   checking in and liking a bunch of stuff over the course of an hour.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.160]   There were no human beings in my feed anymore.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:51.880]   It became about brands and messaging rather than humans with messages.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.200]   Likewise, content mills rose to the top.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:00.800]   Neither-- nearly my entire feed was given over to Upworthy and the Huffington Post.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.120]   As I went to bed that first night and scrolled through my newsfeed, the updates I saw were
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120]   in order--
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.680]   Huffington Post, Upworthy.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.920]   Huffington Post, Upworthy.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:12.400]   A Levi's ad, space.com, Huffington Post, Upworthy.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.360]   The Verge, Huffington Post, space.com, Upworthy, space.com.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.440]   That'd be good rap song.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.360]   I guess space.com is a marketing something.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:23.160]   As soon as I went to bed, I remember thinking, oh crap.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.080]   I have to like something about Gaza as I hit the like button on a post with a pro-Israel
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   message.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.080]   And that's the problem.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.080]   You immediately, you're sending a strong signal, probably stronger than you intended
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.080]   to Facebook.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.240]   Oh, he wants more of that.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.720]   By the next morning, the items in my newsfeed had moved very, very far to the right.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.920]   I thought there were experts behind all this stuff that were making it so you actually
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.320]   got stuff that you wanted to do.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.280]   Well, if you like everything-- I think his point here is if you like everything, what
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:54.200]   you expose is just how much of what you think is your core Facebook experience is actually
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.200]   based on--
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.160]   Should this be taken into account by some expert in the back room?
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160]   Robert Scobel.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.800]   Is he in the back room?
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.800]   Oh, what?
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.280]   They finally get him in front of him.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.160]   Robert Scobel, I have been complaining about my newsfeed for a long time.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.360]   And Robert said, "I'm going to take you and I'm going to show you how to make your newsfeed."
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360]   My newsfeed--
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360]   You shouldn't have to do this.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.360]   --is incredibly great.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.360]   You should not have to do this.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.360]   And it has a lot to do with what you like.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   You should not have to do this.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360]   You stop.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.960]   You unlike corporate things.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.760]   You start liking things that you really do want more of.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.440]   You should not have to do this.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.640]   By the next morning, my newsfeed had moved very, very far to the right.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.640]   It continues honing.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.080]   I'm offered the chance to like the Second Amendment and some sort of anti-immigrant page.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.800]   I like them both.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.800]   I like Ted Cruz.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.080]   I like Rick Perry, the conservative Tribune, comes up again and again and again.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.080]   I get to learn its very particular syntax.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.720]   Oh, this is really great.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.560]   Usually, it went something like this.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.680]   A sentence recounting some controversial news.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.680]   Good.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.480]   A sentence explaining why this is good.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:56.280]   A call to action, often ending with a question.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.680]   Once I see this pattern, I start noticing it everywhere.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.680]   And it's true.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.680]   It's the upworthy pattern, isn't it?
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.280]   It tells you how you won't believe what happens next.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.960]   How you feel about something?
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.200]   You will cry when you see this video.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.400]   What happened to the top of this guy's head?
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.800]   You won't believe.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.800]   This guy lost his head.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.960]   You won't believe how?
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.720]   You won't believe what happens next.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:22.000]   I think though, this going back to us.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   I would click that.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   Going back to us talking about-
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   You're just going with the guys' head missing.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.680]   When we're talking about Twitter, when Ben was talking about Twitter, this is a good
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.480]   example of how Twitter and Facebook are different right now, at least for now, which is Facebook
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:38.160]   decided its users couldn't deal with the stream of everything that they have signed
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.160]   up for.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.640]   And so they are aggressively trying to guess what you'll like.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.960]   And Twitter so far doesn't do that.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.720]   The Twitter timeline has some ads in it, but it's basically untouched.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.440]   That time is coming because I think Twitter is going to be saying how to modify these
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.440]   feeds as well.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.960]   Doesn't this just prove though that this is doomed to failure what Facebook's doing,
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.400]   that it's just crap?
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.120]   No, because you're better off with what Twitter is doing, which is just let everything through.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.600]   Don't- Anytime you try to intermediate, you screw it up.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.120]   No, I disagree.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:13.000]   I think John Grooberson is doing this site when he went to this, like, "Oh, this is
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.720]   like Facebook's wet dream or whatever."
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:18.600]   And I think that's actually exactly wrong because this is actually-
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.520]   This Facebook doesn't want this to happen.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:26.240]   The entire goal is to better understand you, to better understand your interests.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.040]   And the result is twofold.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.680]   One, you'll increase engagement.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.760]   You'll stay on site longer.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.920]   You'll come on the site more frequently.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.840]   And I know Facebook, it's a bad rap in tech, but if you look at the actual numbers, they're
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.680]   being quite successful in this.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:44.600]   Not only their engagement continues to rise, and it continues to rise quite a bit.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.840]   And then two, obviously when it comes to advertising, they have that much more accurate
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.520]   of a profile of who you are and what you're interested in.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:58.680]   And so I think, yes, you can abuse anything, but the reality is, is no one likes everything
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.320]   in their stream.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:06.160]   And if anything, the speed with which the stream adapts is almost more impressive than
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.160]   anything.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.560]   It shows how sensitive it is.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.200]   And I found the same thing as Scoble, to be honest.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:16.440]   I mean, I use Facebook a fair bit because when I use it, I get a lot of value by going
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.440]   into it.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.960]   I see primarily a few people that I care about, and they dominate my feed.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.240]   And I don't see much crap because I've always been very careful with my likes.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.800]   I must have done something really wrong because I thought I'd been careful about my likes.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.560]   And my Facebook feed is awful.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:36.760]   Well, you know, the marketing groups use it to, you know, here's a contest, but you have
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.760]   to enter by liking our page or in order to...
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:39.760]   Well, I don't do any of that stuff.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.200]   And that helps junk up your feed.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:45.960]   But, you know, Dan, I think, I think Rubber's point was more that not that liking everything
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:50.200]   is Facebook's wet dream, but that Facebook's goal here, like Google's goal or any of these
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.840]   ad-driven businesses goal, is to get as much signal as possible out of your behavior so
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:58.160]   that they can market to you better and, yeah, get more engagement.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.840]   And that's absolutely what Facebook's doing.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.080]   I think Matt's experiment was really about making it as kind of ridiculous as possible
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.080]   because that's Matt.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:13.200]   And he writes very funny articles to show that your feed is being manipulated by Facebook.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:17.360]   And that's a kind of a simple thesis, but it is true that what you like determines what
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.520]   you see.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.800]   And if there's not a lot of serendipity left on Facebook, it really is about Facebook
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.680]   trying to make guesses about exactly what is going to benefit them in terms of you being
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.960]   engaged and in terms of what they can sell you.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:34.400]   Meanwhile, I went to my Facebook page and I've been sucked into a video of a cat fishing
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.520]   for another cat.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.720]   This is why I don't go to Facebook.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.520]   A cat fishing for another cat.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520]   See that cat?
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.520]   See that fishing pole?
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   See who's on the other end of it?
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520]   I can't.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.520]   This is...
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.520]   I mean, not to either have the Facebook 101 session, but if you hover over that...
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.200]   Can I unlike it?
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.680]   No, you can say block this post or whatever.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.400]   And that's... it's a negative signal.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.800]   And that more than anything probably will clean up your feed pretty quickly.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.120]   I don't want to see this.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.680]   Oh, how could you not want to see that?
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.680]   Come on.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.560]   Don't do it for that first.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.360]   I don't want to see that.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.360]   Why is it...
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360]   So you're saying that if I spend more time...
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.200]   More time working with my feed.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.360]   Curating Facebook, I'll get a better feed.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   Yes, you will.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.800]   Well, it doesn't take long, honestly.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.600]   Just a couple days of actively curating it and it cleans up really quickly.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.600]   It's pretty impressive, actually.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.480]   You used to have to unfriend your person from high school who you don't actually care about,
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.560]   but you said, "Sure, I'll friend you on Facebook."
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.960]   You don't actually have to do that anymore.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.520]   It's very easy to just say, "I'm not interested in what this person writes."
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.520]   And then they go away.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.680]   They're still your friend.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.520]   But you never see them.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.200]   Which is how you like it, probably.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.200]   Okay.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.480]   Very insincere.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.560]   If you missed anything, what's insincere?
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.280]   That idea, what you just described.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.640]   Pretend to like people.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.880]   You don't do that all the time?
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.880]   No.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:55.880]   You just...
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:56.880]   You don't bother.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.880]   Right.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:58.880]   You don't like anybody.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:22:59.880]   No, I like a lot of people.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.880]   Have you been listening to the podcast, Lisa?
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.080]   He eliminates the middleman and goes to the later point where we need everything.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.080]   Again, yeah.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.080]   Hey, everybody.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.800]   Hey, you know, we had a great week, John.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.720]   I bet you'd like to see a house ad right about that.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.160]   House ads, I think, especially the way you do them, are fantastic.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.320]   I mean, there's a lot of people that do house ads in different ways.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.520]   But yours are outstanding.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.520]   I wouldn't get your hopes up on this one.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.520]   Okay.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.520]   Would you mind signing this disclaimer before we begin?
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   No.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]   Let's take a look at what happened this week.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.520]   I just talked to my lawyer on Twitch.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:36.920]   Does he just do the one dance or does he do other stuff?
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.400]   Groot, I'm sorry.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.400]   Oh.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:46.320]   Previously on Twitch, triangulation, the author of the Martian, Andy Weir, so great to talk
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.320]   to you.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:52.080]   More people would buy it from Kindle than download it for free from my site.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.080]   All about Android.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:57.440]   One Plus, which is the maker of the phone, which I have purchased and love.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.040]   So they launched this ladies first contest, host the photo in this thread.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:05.040]   And the 50 most well-liked ladies will be chosen to get an invite.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.560]   No nudity please.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.240]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.320]   We welcome into the show, Twill.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.320]   That's right.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.320]   This week in London.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.960]   I've often wondered what would happen if we combined Twill and Twill and unleashed that
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.600]   evil spawn on the world.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.600]   Tech News today.
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.760]   Can't bring myself to do it.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.160]   I don't want to see the tech side.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.360]   Before you do it, get a couple of hankies.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.040]   These are Jason's sad tweets.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.560]   18 to 2 months without RT or favorite.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.560]   Twits.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.120]   Technology for your eyes and ear holes.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:39.960]   This is what it looks like when two humans kiss from the inside of a...
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:40.960]   Oh!
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.960]   Oh!
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   This is disgusting.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   Why do you show that?
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.960]   I'm so sad.
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.960]   I see that.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960]   Chad, why'd you have to do that?
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.040]   I mean, like, here are my sad tweets.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:56.040]   Two years without a retweet or a favorite.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:02.480]   I like the music.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.480]   Hacking him in.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.800]   This is sad tweets.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:10.520]   Your sad tweets are about Facebook and about whether podcasts are too much.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.520]   That's too much.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.520]   That's too much.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.520]   That's too much.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.520]   It's the same thing.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.520]   Too close.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.520]   It is.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.520]   It's just...
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.520]   But it's with your tweets, which is great.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520]   Okay.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.520]   He's using Twitter quite well, I think.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520]   Don't you think?
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.520]   I think he's doing pretty well.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.200]   I actually prefer the Craig Ferguson approach to Twitter.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.200]   What was that?
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.000]   Were they people read their angry tweets?
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.640]   No, no, that's actually Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.640]   Jimmy Kimmel does that.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.120]   That's a very good bit.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120]   That's very funny.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.120]   You get the people.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:39.480]   The celebrities who are nasty tweeted at to read the nasty tweet.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:40.920]   That's one way to handle trolls.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:41.920]   Just, you know.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:42.920]   Mm-hmm.
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:43.920]   But what is Ferguson?
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:44.920]   I like Ferguson.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:47.120]   Ferguson is very meta.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:51.760]   I would say it's the post-modern of all these talk shows because it's bizarre.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:56.400]   Well, it's got a robot co-host, no band and a horse guy.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.760]   And he's mostly at Lib that show.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.080]   I read an interview with the guy who does the robot.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:07.600]   But he just reads some bull crap tweets that are crap.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.760]   And then he ridicules them and then throws them off the thing and it stops.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.320]   You have to see it.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.320]   It's just fun.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.320]   There's nothing good here.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:22.200]   He has a huge introduction to the segment that's always produced, overproduced.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.160]   And then the segment itself, he just doesn't do it.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.160]   Doesn't do the segment.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.160]   He's anti-television.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.600]   He's leaving, I'm sad to say.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.320]   Well, he got a deal in his contract.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.320]   He got a buyout.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.960]   And if he renewed, he would lose that buyout.
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:34.960]   So he took the buyout.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   It was like $40 million.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   Some doin' nothing.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   It's apparently pretty hard.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   Good for him.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   He'll be back.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   He'll do something else.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   He's broasting.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.960]   He's a smart guy.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.800]   You know, I saw it dinner last night.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.800]   Chelsea Handler.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.840]   She's down the road here at Peace.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840]   What?
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.840]   At what restaurant?
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.840]   Central Market.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.240]   But she's an example of somebody who her comedy central show has ended, but she's going
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.840]   in Netflix where she's, I think, going to do the same thing for Netflix, right?
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.840]   Yeah, and that's the big question of how do you do a timely show on Netflix?
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.080]   What you did in Petaluma?
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.080]   We had a nice dinner.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.160]   We bought her a couple of drinks.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.160]   It was good.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.680]   So I go over to the Petaluma market over here to pick up some lettuce and some stuff
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:09.920]   'cause I need for dinner tonight.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.480]   Yeah, a little grocery shop.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.480]   What a rip off this.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.240]   If you're in a farming community, this is a farming community.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.040]   We're in Sonoma County.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:23.400]   Why would you be paying three bucks for a head of lettuce or a dollar for some green
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.400]   onions?
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.560]   It's just Man some wine.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.560]   I'm down.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.800]   I mean, this is a scam this town.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.240]   John, I never look.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.920]   John C. Devorak.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.720]   Sad tweets, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:43.440]   Our show tonight, hey, before I do that, actually, let's see how it's coming up on the
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.440]   week ahead.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.440]   Mr. Michael Elgin.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.880]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.880]   Yeah, there.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.200]   HTC is announcing something on Tuesday, August 19th in New York City.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:56.440]   Possibilities include a Nexus 8 tablet, a Windows phone handset or a wearable device of
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.720]   some kind.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:01.720]   On Wednesday, August 20th, Samsung and Barnes & Noble are having a joint announcement where
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.960]   they'll roll out the Galaxy Tab for Nook.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.400]   That launch will also take place in New York City but at a Barnes & Noble store in Union
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.400]   Square.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.400]   Is he making this up?
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.560]   And Sprint's new CEO said at a company-wide town hall meeting Thursday that he would announce
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.000]   new quote "very disruptive prices for wireless plans," so we'll be looking for that announcement
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   as well.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000]   What's the next thing?
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   The next thing is unlikely.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.160]   I think HTC is going to do their HTC One, the current version, the M8 for with Windows
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.680]   7 or Windows 8, which will be awesome.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.680]   Be a nice phone.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.240]   You never know that.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:38.000]   Windows Phone hasn't had a good week.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.800]   It's not been a good week for Windows Phone.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.600]   I bricked my 1520.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:42.600]   What?
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.920]   Sad because that's a nice phone.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.920]   I love that phone.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.920]   Six-inch screenboard.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:47.920]   How did you brick it?
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.920]   It's Palfourot's phone.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.440]   He told me- no, this isn't really his fault.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.520]   He told me that- because I had the 1520, it was on Windows Phone 8.1.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.720]   He said, "You can get the update to 8.1," or actually it was 8.0, and he can get the
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:09.240]   update to 8.1 by joining the developer preview, which is free, so I did, downloaded it.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:13.560]   And then Microsoft and their infinite wisdom decided to freeze the firmware for those of
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.400]   us who did that because they were having some problems.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.360]   It was crashing some people's phones.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.440]   So Daniel Rabina from Windows Phone Center, who was on Windows Weekly on Wednesday, said,
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.960]   "Well, just roll it back.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.960]   It's easy.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.680]   You just get the Nokia software removal tool or a revival tool or whatever, NSRT, and run
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.280]   it on a Windows machine, so I did."
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.440]   And it brick the phone.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.440]   Oh.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.680]   Won't even- I can't get anything, nothing out of it.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.080]   You want it, what are you going to do about it?
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.080]   Give it to you.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.080]   I'll take it.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.080]   You want it?
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.080]   I can get it on brick.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.080]   I have a- I would love to see that.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.080]   Okay.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.080]   You think you could?
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.080]   Oh yeah, I know I could.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.080]   Awesome.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.640]   It don't ever tweet stuff like this because then you get everybody.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.760]   Nokia USA Cortana was tweeting at me.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:00.960]   It's like- And the first thing it tweets is all the stuff you've already tried.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.760]   And I said, "Look, I Googled it.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.560]   I've tried everything that you could find on Google.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560]   You got anything else?
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.800]   Because I've done all that.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.560]   I'm not an idiot."
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:15.520]   So, by the way, one of the things- and he had us- Cortana or Nokia USA sent me a screenshot
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:16.520]   of something.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.520]   Could you just ask Cortana to-
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.600]   Power up, power down, power up, power down, off, off, off, camera, camera, phone up.
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.320]   It sounds like a game thing.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.120]   This is an old Googled again.
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.720]   Cortana is trolling you, Leo.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720]   Yes, totally.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720]   I've popped down.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.720]   Maybe I was being trolled.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.720]   Maybe it's fake, Cordana.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.760]   Should be better, labeled.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.760]   Okay, Google.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.880]   Apparently, it turns anything- It works for anything.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:44.320]   Apparently, people that listen to the show, I was reading this- they're to be at home and
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:47.600]   somebody says, "Okay, Google," and to the podcast.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.600]   It's worse than that.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:52.000]   Today on the radio show, I said, "Yes, Sir-E."
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000]   And somebody's-
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   Yes, Sir-E.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000]   IOSA went off, right?
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   IOSA went off.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000]   It's supposed to be "Hey, Sir-E."
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000]   I said, "Yes, Sir-E."
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.440]   And it went off, and it then transcribed everything I said, and then searched for it
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.440]   on the web.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:08.600]   He sent me a screenshot.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:12.000]   It happened with the Xbox, too.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.800]   There was an advertisement.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:19.360]   Yeah, it was Aaron Paul who is Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   It's a great one.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360]   He says, "Okay, Xbox."
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.160]   He's talking to his Xbox.
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.440]   In one place, it says, "Play Titanfall."
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.440]   And he starts playing Titanfall.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:30.040]   Apparently, people were complaining because in the middle of the ad, Titanfall was launching
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.840]   on their Xbox one.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.760]   It never happened to me.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:34.760]   Here it is.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:38.400]   Okay, I found this on the web for her on the phone questions better serve.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.520]   You want to stay with California, North Carolina.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.240]   Do everybody please check it out.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.760]   Which was its failed transcription of what I was saying.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.760]   I would think.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.000]   All because I said, "Yes, Sir-E."
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.800]   This is going to be a new thing.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.040]   Somebody is just going to shout out, "Hey, Sir-E, send a text message to my mom."
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.960]   So I am sorry for what I did.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.200]   That's a good one.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.640]   It's time to come clean.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.560]   It's time to come clean.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:03.560]   Yes, send that.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.040]   Is this something new in iOS 8 that it's always going to be?
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.520]   That's an iOS 8 thing that you can turn on where, if you say, "Hey, Sir-E."
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.800]   Does it know it's your voice?
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.040]   Well, that's the question.
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.040]   I'm unclear on what they're doing.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.040]   They're going to do it.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.040]   Because the X too much work.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:18.360]   The Motorola X, if you said, "Okay, Google," or "Okay, something."
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   "Okay, Google."
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.040]   No, it wasn't "Okay, Google," because it was Motorola.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:24.960]   I think it was, anyway, it would talk to you, but you trained it three times with your
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.960]   voice.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:29.320]   I hope they do that with Siri or we're going to be funny.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.320]   Yeah, that's going to be funny.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.680]   It does work with Google Glass.
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.680]   It's voice independent.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.680]   Right.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.680]   Somebody with Google Glass.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:37.560]   You can yell, "Okay, Google, take a picture," and it'll take a picture of it.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.560]   It's a bad idea.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.560]   I like that.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:40.560]   That's great.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:41.560]   Then they'll punch you in the nose.
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.680]   After the word "Google Glass" are so macho, so tough.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.320]   They have to be there wearing Google Glass.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:53.640]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com, the secret behind some of the best websites

[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.280]   Knowagendashow.com.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:23.360]   Everybody is watching.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.280]   Go there right now and see if we can bring it down.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.280]   We can't.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.240]   If you are a developer, they have a great...
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240]   See?
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.240]   Boom.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.240]   Came right up, didn't it?
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.240]   Snappy.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.480]   Keep hitting it.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   Keep hitting it, everybody.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.880]   Keep hitting it.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:43.160]   If you are a developer, they have a great developer platform with syntax coloring and all that
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.480]   stuff.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:48.120]   They have templates that are just stunning, but there's some stuff behind the scenes
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.120]   you may not realize.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.320]   First of all, every template is a state-of-the-art HTML5 template.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.520]   Mobile responsive.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.200]   When you upload an image, it automatically makes nine thumbnails for every possible size.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:03.160]   It reflows the screen no matter which size or shape the screen's on.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.880]   So there isn't a mobile site per se.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.720]   Every site looks great on every size screen.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:11.480]   They also have every template has e-commerce.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:15.280]   They've got a logo creator tool, which is very simple, but individuals in small businesses
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:18.640]   with limited resources can create a simple identity for themselves.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.640]   It's beautiful.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.640]   They've got apps for the iPhone and the iPad that are second and not.
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:27.720]   In fact, they won four Webby Awards for their apps this year.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:31.320]   The metric app, for instance, will let you get page views, unique visitors, social media
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:33.000]   follows for your website.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.400]   They've got a blog app that makes it easy to post, moderate comments.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.640]   SquareSpace is gorgeous.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.640]   It's beautifully done.

[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.360]   You can import all your existing stuff.
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.160]   They've got importers for all the major blog APIs.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:57.560]   A better Web awaits you at squarespace.com.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:03.000]   All I ask is if you decide to buy, you use the offer code TWIT and you'll get 10% off
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.360]   on your new account.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.360]   10% off.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.160]   And you'll be showing your support for this week in tech.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.000]   Squarespace.com, $8 a month.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.160]   And when you register for a year, that gives you the free domain name, too.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.960]   Squarespace.com offer code is TWIT 10% off.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.880]   If you're giving your free domain name nowadays.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.120]   If you register for a year, yeah.
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.120]   That's a good deal.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.520]   Yeah, I think it's not.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.240]   How much does it cost for 15 bucks?
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.080]   Well, it's something, right?
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.320]   But it's the rig of a role to go through it to get it over there.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:32.320]   That's the thing.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   It's more important than that.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320]   They hook it up so that you don't.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.760]   It makes it much easier.
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:38.080]   You know, it was 33 hard to believe.
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:40.040]   August 12, 1981.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.040]   You know what happened.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.920]   33 years ago on August 12.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:44.920]   You do.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:45.920]   You were there.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:46.920]   I was.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:47.920]   Yeah, you'll never forget it.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.400]   The IBM PC was there.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   Oh, right.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.400]   I was actually at that.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:52.400]   I know you were.
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.400]   Yeah, I was.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.160]   The 5150, it's 33.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.400]   It seems like it's older than that in some ways.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.440]   I mean, look how far we've come in 33 years.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:06.120]   Your phone now has 10 times a thousand times the power that I've been losing.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.080]   I mean, it was a 4.77 megahertz 8080, right?
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.080]   Yep.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.120]   Let me see if I can find all the specs because it was expensive.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:15.120]   Remember what it cost?
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.280]   It had a tape interface too.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.680]   Yeah, it had a cassette interface.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.840]   It could have a floppy in it, but it had a cassette interface.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.320]   Yeah, they cost a fortune.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.880]   They cost about 3500 bucks.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.360]   Incredible.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.960]   Here's the IBM PC's debut reference room.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:34.680]   You could get it for like 1600 bucks if you didn't get anything.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.040]   If you got nothing, it was just right.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.400]   Which meant you couldn't do anything.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.280]   No, you need to buy a memory card.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.520]   You need to buy IO.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.520]   You need to buy floppy disks.
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:46.600]   You need to buy a monitor.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.600]   Pretty amazing.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.600]   I think keyboard.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:56.880]   It was 20 inches wide, 16 inches deep, 5.5 inches high, 21 pounds, 21 pounds.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.600]   Yeah, the disk drive, it's 25 pounds.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.080]   Yeah, 4 pound disk drive.
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.280]   Memory, it came with 40K built in raw.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.640]   Should be enough for anyone.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:10.240]   That's, and 16 to 256K user memory.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:11.240]   That was the top.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:13.240]   256.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.800]   Did come with a keyboard, nice keyboard.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.960]   Still to this day, a good keyboard.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:18.640]   Yeah, that's a fact.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:24.920]   cassette player jack for cassette attachment, 5 expansion slots, built in speaker for musical
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.800]   programming.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.800]   Really?
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:28.800]   Yeah, squeak.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:32.440]   What kind of musical programming is?
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:39.800]   Oh, this is a come standard with power on automatic self-test of system components.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.480]   Basic language interpreter in 16K.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.640]   That's the standard.
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.760]   I like to think the musical programming is you could write basic programs using like a
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.560]   musical keyboard, like play a little something and it would.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.560]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.600]   There was more actually a bunch of noises like this.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.600]   I'll play it.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.080]   I'll play it for you right now.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.600]   This is, you've seen this.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.680]   You know what I'm talking about.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:06.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the IBM PC.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.200]   Oh, there's an ad.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:09.200]   Don't you hate that?
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.200]   Well, that takes a few seconds.
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.200]   This ad brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.120]   Oh, here we go.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.120]   Get ready.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:30.560]   I hate this song.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:36.920]   It's pretty good.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.000]   That's floppy this.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.560]   And one hard drive.
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.200]   That's probably the bass.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.000]   That sounds like Angry Birds.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.720]   Is that the Surface commercial?
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:59.440]   Somebody somewhere as a version of this with the actual lead singer of Soft Cell singing
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:00.440]   along, Mark Almond.
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.800]   I mean, here we go.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.440]   This is, of course, it's on Buzzfeed.
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.120]   You won't believe what happens next.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:08.680]   You won't believe what happens next.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:09.680]   Does this have an ad too?
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:10.680]   No.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.400]   That's the one you should listen to.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.400]   Let's jump ahead here.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.400]   ♪ Said seems to go nowhere ♪
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.240]   ♪ And I've lost my life for I've tossed ♪
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.400]   Of course, the drives are actually playing the vocal track.
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.120]   No, it's right.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.120]   Right.
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:31.960]   ♪ Now I'll run for you ♪
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.240]   Well, I really feel sorry for us, Mark Almond, who pretty much that's it.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.240]   That was the highlight right there.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.840]   As good as it got.
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:48.240]   As long as we're talking robots, how about a robot that makes hamburgers...
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.560]   Ten hamburgers a second?
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:50.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.560]   That can't be right.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:52.560]   That's pretty...
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.320]   Ten seconds a hamburger.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:02.880]   That's still pretty fast, especially when you're dealing with a soft tomato.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:09.160]   The burger robot is poised, according to Jason Doria writing for Singularity Up, poised
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.080]   to disrupt the fast food industry.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.200]   Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:21.080]   Our device isn't meant to make employees more efficient, says co-founder Alexandros Vardicostas.
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.840]   It's meant to completely obviate them.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.840]   Mm-hmm.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.840]   Fortunately, somebody who might work at McDonough doesn't know what the word obviate means.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:29.840]   He does McDonald's.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.080]   I think McDonald's doesn't either.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.360]   The man who invented pop-up ads says, "I'm sorry.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.800]   Here's the burger machine, by the way."
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:45.360]   Yeah, I'm writing about the saying sorry thing.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.360]   Ethan's document?
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.360]   Tell us about that.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.120]   Well, the problem with the article, I mean, it's basically saying how...
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:52.040]   I think it's called the Internet's Original Sin.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:55.240]   It's complaining about advertising.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:00.080]   And it's one of those things where it's very fun to write an article if you're willing
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:05.200]   to forego any zebwoods of basic economics and understanding how the world works.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:10.160]   He says in the subhead, "It's not too late to ditch the ad-based business model and build
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.160]   a better web."
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.680]   You remember in your early days.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:16.240]   It's the same thing as the Twitter discussion.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:19.000]   There's a good side and a bad side to everything.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.080]   The good side of the Internet is that everyone has a platform.
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:24.320]   Everyone has a voice.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.080]   The bad side to that from a certain perspective is that there's always going to be something
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.080]   that's cheaper than what else is out there.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:37.520]   To reproduce an article costs zero dollars, which means any general piece of crap is going
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.680]   to be zero dollars.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.960]   If you want to charge for it, that doesn't happen by magically waving your hand and saying,
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.440]   "I'm not going to use advertising.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.440]   You're going to pay for it.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:50.200]   The reality is no one's going to pay unless you can really deliver value in a way that
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:53.120]   people find it to be meaningful."
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:59.960]   Advertising is inevitable when it comes to something like the Internet with its frictionless
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.960]   content.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:01.960]   It's like podcasts.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:07.880]   Like jobs was right, that podcast would be free is because everyone, people make podcasts
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.440]   for fun, for passion.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:15.760]   There's always going to be a free alternative.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:19.760]   That's a result of economics, not a result of someone making a mistake.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:22.600]   There's no gene you put back in the bottle.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:28.880]   Actually, John here and I have differing models for podcast success.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.840]   No agenda is totally donation driven.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.840]   Right.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:32.840]   And it's done quite well.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.480]   Yeah, we've done okay.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.480]   And I think that's fine.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.920]   You would have probably done okay too, but not with the big studio and all this stuff.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.800]   Oh yeah, I would have done this level of okay.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.960]   We couldn't have grown to the 30 shows.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.840]   But you could have done that model.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:47.840]   If you stated that.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.840]   We wanted to.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:49.840]   We wanted to.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:50.840]   We probably have as much money in the bank.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.600]   Yeah, well that's another story I can talk about that if you want.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.600]   No.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.120]   But no, I wanted to do more.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.120]   And the same with you.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.440]   You're trying to build more of a network.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.120]   We tried donations in the beginning and they were fine.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.120]   You're right.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.360]   For one man, that would have been enough to live on.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:11.480]   But it didn't give me a chance to do a second show or add additional staff or build a studio
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.560]   or any of that stuff.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:13.560]   The ad model is great.
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:18.400]   I think as Mike Elgin who said, I like it because it's fundamentally democratic.
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:23.840]   These are free and they're kept free even though we have a fairly high cost of production
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:26.040]   by the fact that advertisers are willing to pay for it.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:28.000]   And we only do an ad every half hour.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.360]   It's not like we overwhelm you with that.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.480]   Well, no, I mean you're right.
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.480]   That's a big yet.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:35.840]   I don't want to ever do more than that.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.920]   I never wanted to do that much.
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:43.840]   But the reason it could be yet is because there is downward pressure on pricing and
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:50.440]   that's coming from groups like Podcast One who are charging radio rights for podcasts.
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.280]   Very cheap rates.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:58.440]   And what that does is it put radio because nobody paid attention to the number of ads,
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.040]   the quality of the experience for the listener, they merely paid attention to how much money
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:05.640]   can we make has 19 minutes an hour of advertising.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.440]   Which is typical of TV and radio.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.440]   20 minutes.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.280]   And yeah, 20 minutes.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.840]   So that's what happens if you push the price down.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.360]   Well, the reason that we knew, I mean we could have done that too, but we felt that it wasn't,
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.760]   it was the kind of show we do.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:21.760]   We cannot afford to.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.240]   Well, you don't want advertisers because you want to be able to speak your mind, right?
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:26.240]   Pretty much.
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:28.240]   And there are two tiers of people.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:31.000]   You get the people who just kind of are interested in what you have to say, but they're
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.600]   not going to pay you anything for it and they want to listen and that's good.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:38.880]   And then you've got your big fans who, I think the challenge for a lot of podcasts and other
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.440]   things on the internet is can you do a two-tiered approach where you give things away, but there's
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:48.280]   also something that people who want to support you or who want even more can give you some
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:49.280]   money.
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.040]   I mean, Ben, you are running a website that's got some free stuff and also has paid subscriptions.
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:55.040]   It's the same sort of story.
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.040]   Free view.
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.040]   A little bit of both.
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.040]   No, exactly.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:02.040]   I mean, freemium is really the only model I think that works on the internet because
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:07.040]   the reality is when there's so much out there, why should someone, and this goes to apps,
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.040]   it goes to all these sort of things that's arising up, like why should someone give you
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.680]   money sight unseen?
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.680]   It's unrealistic.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.480]   I mean, because they can just go visit a million other things.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.720]   And so the internet, like it gives you, I have free distribution doesn't cost me anything
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.400]   to serve people for free.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.280]   And this is very different than before.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.280]   And so people can come to my site, they can read my articles, they can build trust so
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.800]   they can assume, man, every time I come here, that's actually pretty interesting.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.560]   And now they're much more willing to spend some money to get more because they have a
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.400]   reasonable expectation that's going to be worth their money.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.000]   Well, you know, you say that freemium is the only thing at worst, but you're talking
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.160]   to Leo here who's making like eight to nine million dollars a year, not using that model.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.920]   I think that works as far as charging people directly.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.920]   So here's my problem.
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.680]   No, I actually charge for something you've given away.
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.680]   We don't have it that way.
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.520]   You have to find something else that's additional that goes beyond.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.600]   And then my other problem with that is copy.
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.600]   I would argue against this.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:08.520]   Because as soon as you start charging for something, you want to control distribution
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.520]   of it.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:14.360]   But I think the people who are giving you money are not giving you money because you're handing
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:19.160]   them something that's super exclusive that they can't get to a friend.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:22.320]   They want to support you and they want to and plus you can give them some convenience.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.320]   They don't have to pirate it.
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:24.760]   They don't have to find a place for it.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.320]   And they feel good because they like you and they want to give you money.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.200]   I think you have plenty of models.
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:32.520]   I think the freemium models is a perfect model for certain kinds of things.
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:37.520]   I we want to actually do DH unplugged in that using the freemium model because when we do
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:42.120]   our stock tips, that's the value of the show that because people when it comes to the financial
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.240]   world, all they want is stock tips.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.240]   They want to know how to make money.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:47.040]   And if you give them information, they will help them make money.
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.240]   So that way they will pay for it.
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.040]   That would go to a freemium firewall.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.200]   I hope you have them signing a disclaimer.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:54.200]   Oh, we always have to sign up.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:55.200]   Of course.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.200]   So we could do that.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:59.800]   But for the straight up donation model, I think that works fine.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:01.600]   And I think the pure commercial.
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:02.960]   Here's all three models work fine.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:05.880]   I disagree that the donation model doesn't work.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.680]   Here's an interesting point that Ethan makes in his article.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:14.440]   He says, the problem with online advertising is it makes so little money.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.920]   It's worth so little.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:21.360]   Last quarter, Facebook reported it had 1.32 billion users connected to 2.91 billion in revenue.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.320]   He made a profit of 791 million.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.960]   Profit margin of 27%.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.440]   Clearly, he says Facebook's doing a great job making money from ads.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:34.240]   But the profit per user is 60 cents.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.680]   And that's a fascinating figure because Facebook reports users spend 40 minutes a day on the
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:39.840]   site, 60 hours a quarter.
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.400]   So they're getting paid a penny an hour for that user.
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.400]   Leo, you just articulated how crap you think Facebook is.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.160]   So it sounds like they're getting as hard as exactly what should be.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.320]   It's worth a penny an hour to me.
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:52.760]   No, but that's exactly the point.
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:57.200]   I mean, the whole thing with the internet is it makes it trivial to generate content.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:01.040]   And that by definition means that content is worth less.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.000]   But I think it's possible to make content that's worth more.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000]   We're trying to make content that's worth more.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.840]   Oh, I mean, I charge people $10 a month, $100 a year.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:14.320]   And I have quite a few subscribers who think it is worth it.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.560]   And I'm not saying that it's impossible.
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:22.440]   I'm just saying like the non-differentiated content is by definition going to go to zero.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.400]   And that doesn't mean you can't differentiate.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:29.160]   Well, but again, and this is my point about podcast one another is it gets harder to differentiate
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:34.400]   because there is pressure to lower your rates to be an advertiser.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.040]   Say, well, look, I can get the same ad on some other podcast for a buck.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.000]   Why are you charging 10 bucks for it?
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]   Well, I do that.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.800]   I tell my sales team.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.960]   You cannot lower the price.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:51.440]   But there's considerable pressure to do so by the advertiser.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.120]   Yeah, but you're a specialty operation.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.720]   Well, that's how you handle it, right?
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.600]   Premium content also you talk about the results and that your audience is more attached and
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.600]   all of the all the things.
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.000]   But it's funny because that's true.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.600]   But the advertisers still they're going, well, but it's only a buck.
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:08.600]   I know I won't get the same results, but it's only a buck.
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:10.400]   It's hard to convince them.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:13.440]   They are getting what they're paying for, but it's getting harder and harder to convince.
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:16.000]   I don't see any evidence of this that is getting harder and harder.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.120]   You have more advertisers every time I come on the show.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.560]   No, well, take it from me.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:21.560]   It is getting harder.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.200]   Okay, I'll take your word for it.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:26.160]   It's not like I'm thrown in the towel.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.960]   I don't mean to say we're broke, but it just, I notice it's getting harder and it worries
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.800]   me that the pressure there is down the pressure.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:34.400]   Well, it is also a cycle.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:37.160]   But the other thing, it's increased competition.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:42.280]   I mean, if you look at it, take the Facebook thing, for example, like he's complaining that
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:46.040]   Facebook is only getting that people are spending all this time on Facebook and they're only
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:48.040]   worth this little bit of money.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.280]   What that is in economic terms is excess value and that's all going to the consumer.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:59.760]   I think because the people who have the big podiums, the soapboxes are being hurt by
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.040]   this, everyone talks about internet economics is being this terrible thing.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:07.040]   When from a consumer perspective, it's actually pretty great.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.680]   I have access to this network.
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:14.440]   I live in Taiwan, I have full access to the lives of my friends and family and I get it
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.440]   for free.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.600]   The internet, everything has its good sides and its bad sides.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:24.040]   What irks me about this article, I think I'm going to write about it on Monday so everyone
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.880]   can check it out.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.160]   It totally focuses on one side and ignores one, the good things about it.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:37.600]   Two is in this fantasy world that pretends like it could have ever been in anything differently.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:40.080]   I'm more irritated with the people that retweeted it.
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.280]   I feel people that should know better.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.840]   They didn't read the article, they just liked the headline.
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:44.840]   Seriously.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:45.840]   Seriously.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.840]   Full circle.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.720]   Let's put satire around it and then everybody will be okay with it.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:53.000]   Our show today brought to you one last ad, do you mind?
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.600]   I have nothing to do with it.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:55.600]   Okay.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.600]   Just check it.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:57.920]   Whether I mind or not is irrelevant.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.200]   One last ad.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:00.520]   I think you should do two more ads.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.800]   I would love to.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.800]   Rake it in.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:03.800]   Rake it in.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:05.440]   But no, I've limited it to one per half hour.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.840]   We are in our fourth half hour, our fourth ad.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, I tell you about ziprecruiter.com.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:15.000]   If you are hiring, if you're looking for people you know that there are plenty of places,
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.200]   the internet really makes it easier to find staff.
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:23.240]   But there's a hell of a lot of job sites, more than 50 plus there's LinkedIn and there's
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:28.440]   Twitter and there's lots of places you can go to post a ad for a staff.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.440]   Where do you want to go?
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   What is the best place to go?
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:35.400]   Well, ZipRecruiter solves all that by posting the 50 plus job boards with a single submission
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:40.760]   and to LinkedIn and Facebook and Twitter and Google+.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:44.620]   It makes it very easy too as those resumes start rolling in.
[01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:50.280]   You can use their system to view and share formatted resumes, screen candidates quickly
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:51.680]   and easily.
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:58.280]   You'll get a customized jobs page for your website, a company careers page as well.
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:02.560]   You could track and rate applicants from their first visit to the higher.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:08.360]   It is very powerful stuff and I want you to try it free right now by visiting ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:12.000]   Yes, employers should visit ZipRecruiter but so should job seekers.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.560]   It's a great place to go to get a job as well.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:20.360]   If you want to find the perfect hire, you've got to go to ziprecruiter.com, join over 200,000
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:24.880]   businesses, make it 200,000 in one because we use it too.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:33.320]   You can see exactly how it works at ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:35.000]   That's one thing you don't have to worry about, John.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000]   That's good.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000]   You don't have to hire staff.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.240]   We try to run on a low budget.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:41.240]   Staffs what kills you?
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.480]   I would think staff would be paid and they have to, well, I don't think that's the worst
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:48.080]   of it is you have to manage them.
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:49.080]   HR.
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:50.080]   HR is a good thing.
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.080]   We actually go all around the horn here.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.080]   We're right back to the game.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.040]   We recently outsourced our HR.
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:56.040]   Why?
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:57.040]   Some guy named Jimmy.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.040]   At least not a guy named Ben.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.040]   No, no, actually.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:04.760]   ADP who does payroll also, we can outsource HR through them.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.480]   It's not working out so great.
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.920]   I wouldn't think so.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.320]   That's how I know what a challenge it is.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.320]   Do you work in HR?
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:12.320]   Is that why you're laughing?
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.320]   She's laughing.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.320]   She's laughing.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.320]   I think she works in HR.
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.320]   She might.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.320]   She might be an HR person.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.160]   She knows all about it.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:24.440]   Here's a site that's probably a parody site.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.320]   Mary Tyler Horr.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.320]   I think that's probably a parody site.
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.320]   Mary Tyler Horr.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:33.480]   See, if I were Mary Tyler more, I'd be offended.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.280]   I'm just looking at my Twitter.
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.280]   I just noticed.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:37.760]   So you're following Mary Tyler Horr?
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.760]   No, I'm not.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.240]   Well, then why did you show up at all?
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.240]   This is the new Twitter.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.960]   Oh, that's where they slip all this crap in.
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:43.960]   They slip crap in.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:44.960]   I don't want to follow her.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:45.960]   How can I block that?
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:47.440]   Why would they slip that in?
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.440]   Is she paying extra?
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:49.440]   I don't know.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.600]   This is a parody site.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:51.840]   Pretty sure I'm not following her.
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:53.160]   I'm sure you're not.
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:56.640]   Click on it and find out on her.
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:57.640]   Oh, I am.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.040]   She has your following.
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.640]   Let's unfollow Mary Tyler Horr.
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:03.080]   Oh, I'm a little bit, you know.
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:04.840]   Oh, so much for that to me.
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:06.480]   I don't remember following her.
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.480]   I'm just saying.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.480]   Uh-huh.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:11.400]   Ooh, Horr.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:12.480]   Tlic.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:15.840]   Where's the like button?
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.760]   Okay, onward.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.760]   That's it.
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.760]   I'm done.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.760]   Let's see.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:22.760]   There's a couple of quickies we could do here.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:26.320]   Comcast tells the customer the only reason he's getting bogus charges refunded is because
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.200]   he recorded the call.
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:29.200]   That's fair.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:30.840]   What?
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:34.280]   He actually had to play back the recording he made to say, "No, no, you said this would
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.280]   be free."
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.800]   And then they said, "Well, it's not free.
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:39.760]   It shouldn't be free, but okay, you got a recording, I guess we'll make it free."
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:42.200]   So the moral is record every call with Comcast.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.200]   Mm-hmm.
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.200]   Allegedly, I might have stayed in California.
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.200]   No, no.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.760]   Yeah, because we were a two-party state, but it's simple.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:51.560]   And they play that recording that says calls being recorded for quality purposes, say,
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:54.440]   "I'm recording this call."
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:55.440]   That's it.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:57.640]   Did an attorney tell you that was--
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:54:58.640]   I read it on the--
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:01.200]   You read it on the internet, okay.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:02.280]   Talk to your lawyer.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:03.280]   You don't?
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:04.280]   Okay, this is what I believe to be true.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:05.280]   I believe in law.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.720]   I believe that I'm reading it right now.
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:09.840]   I believe this to be true, that they don't have to consent.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:12.000]   Their assent is by merely staying online.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.520]   So if you say to-- you can't say it to a recording, but if you say to a human, I'm
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:19.040]   going to record this call, you don't have to say, "Do you mind?
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:20.040]   Is that okay?"
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.760]   You just say, "I'm going to record this call."
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.760]   And that's it.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:23.760]   Well, that's fine.
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:25.760]   Well, if they say, "I don't like that idea."
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.120]   If they hang it up, that's fine.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:30.400]   Then you have to call another Comcast rep and say the same thing until you find somebody
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.520]   who doesn't.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520]   I wonder if they would have--
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.080]   How about changing the law?
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:36.080]   No, no, no.
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:37.800]   I think two-party is good.
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:38.800]   It's not in every state.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:40.800]   It's only about, I think, half the states.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:41.800]   Why?
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:42.800]   What's so good about that?
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.160]   I think if one party is recording, shouldn't you be able to record it yourself at that
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.160]   point?
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.160]   I think it should.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.160]   Maybe you're right.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:49.160]   Because they're doing it on the other side.
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:50.160]   Yeah, I think they're doing it on the other side.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:51.160]   Any of them will improve it in the law, at least.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:55.440]   If they're going to record, you can record to verify their recording is accurate.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:58.160]   By the way, Leo, did you tell me you were recording this show?
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.160]   Because I don't recall this.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.160]   It's not a phone call.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:02.840]   It's a Skype call.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:04.320]   I could do anything I want.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.320]   Actually, is that the message?
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:06.560]   I forgot to hit the record anyway.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:07.560]   It is.
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:08.560]   I think so.
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:09.560]   Good.
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:10.560]   All right.
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:11.560]   We forgot to record this show, so you're all right.
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:12.560]   That's great.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:13.800]   Oh, Samsung Bart SmartThings, one of our sponsors.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:14.800]   You see?
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:15.800]   They're shrinking already.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:21.480]   SmartThings was a Kickstarter that got its funding on Kickstarter and has now...
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.480]   They're...
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.480]   It's a home automation hub.
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:24.480]   It's actually a really great product.
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:25.480]   I use it.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.560]   They just sold out to Samsung for 200 bucks.
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:29.560]   200 bucks.
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:30.560]   200...
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:31.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:32.560]   I left out the million.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.800]   Well, it is a Kickstarter.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:37.800]   That's the owner package on Kickstarter.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800]   The owner here.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:39.800]   A little small.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:40.800]   A couple of zeros.
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:41.800]   The owner here, $200.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:42.800]   I got it.
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:45.760]   I wonder, though, the same thing happened with Oculus VR, which was also Kickstarter.
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:46.760]   This is...
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:47.760]   This raises...
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:51.440]   Is there an ethical issue raised by this that you give money to a Kickstarter project?
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:52.440]   You fundamentally get on it.
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:53.440]   You feel good about it.
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:54.440]   You're not investing in their company.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:55.440]   You're not getting stocky.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.440]   You're not getting stocky.
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.400]   Yeah, but don't you feel a little bit like...
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.400]   You've been taking?
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:00.400]   You've been taking?
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.400]   Then they maybe didn't need your help?
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:03.120]   Well, no, you kickstarted them into the stratosphere with that.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:04.120]   Yeah, it was...
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:05.120]   And where's my portion of the company?
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.120]   You get your own whatever crap that you sign up for.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.120]   You get your own whatever crap that you sign up for.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:09.120]   You get your own whatever crap that you sign up for.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.120]   Give them money directly when they have them sign some document and you get a couple
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.120]   of points.
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:13.120]   You can do that.
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:17.680]   I think people understand when they go to Kickstarter that this could happen.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:18.680]   They do now.
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:19.680]   Yeah, I think people...
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:21.760]   The Oculus thing really, I think, kick that up.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:22.760]   Oculus pips people off.
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:24.520]   I think people think of Kickstarter as a store to...
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:25.520]   Well, they should.
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:26.800]   They should have given everybody.
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:29.140]   I think if the Kickstarter...
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:32.760]   You should put some money in Kickstarter and you should get something out of it.
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:33.760]   You do.
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:35.360]   In this case, you got a smart thing set.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.360]   Well, then fine.
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.360]   What's the big deal?
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.720]   So it is like a store in that respect.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.720]   Same thing with the Oculus Rift.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:41.720]   I got the developer decision.
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:46.120]   We're pissed off with Oculus because there was this great hope it would be a grassroots...
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:50.000]   The whole idea was we are supporting you so that you can do this thing that nobody else
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000]   wants to do and you can use that thing.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.920]   And then you sell out.
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:53.920]   You sell out.
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:54.920]   It's the risk.
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:58.320]   I think it was more viewed as a moral failing not that they did get their products.
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:57:59.320]   Yeah, it's just...
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.320]   That's what idealism will get you sometimes.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:02.320]   You can't be pointed at.
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:04.520]   That's what I say.
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:05.520]   Sometimes.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:06.520]   Always.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:09.920]   I was hedging for the Internet TV, Netcast broadcast broadcast.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.720]   I've been infected by John.
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:13.720]   Sorry about that.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.720]   You guys are turning into cynics.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.720]   We are.
[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:17.480]   All right, well, here's something that will make you happy.
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:24.840]   The folks at Tesla have decided to give people who own Model S Teslas an infinite warranty
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.280]   on the drive unit.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:28.280]   Infinite miles.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.280]   Infinite miles.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.280]   It's eight years around infinite miles.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.280]   It's eight years.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:33.280]   Which ever comes first.
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:34.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:35.280]   Eight years.
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.280]   How do you drive infinite miles in eight years?
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.520]   Well, you can't.
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:39.520]   That's the point.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.520]   I'm not reaching for reach infinity.
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:42.000]   So it's basically an eight year warranty.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000]   It's an eight year.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.400]   No matter how many miles you drive.
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:46.000]   With this weekend math.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000]   And you...
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.160]   How does that work exactly?
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:50.160]   How many miles...
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:51.160]   Yes.
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:52.160]   How many miles can you drive any...
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:54.440]   Not more than a hundred thousand a year.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.440]   That would be a lot.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:56.440]   Yeah, it would be outrageous.
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:57.680]   You'd have to be charging it all the time.
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:58:58.680]   Yeah, you literally...
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:58:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.680]   You couldn't drive it that much.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.680]   Well, actually that's a good point.
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:03.080]   How long does it take to charge it?
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:04.080]   Overnight.
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:05.080]   I think you know...
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:06.080]   No, no.
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:07.080]   At a supercharger.
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:08.080]   I mean, that would be a good math problem.
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.640]   If first episode or pie episode or...
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:12.120]   Yeah, the pie episode.
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:13.560]   Yeah, so the minus first...
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:14.560]   The minus first...
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:15.560]   Yeah, episode would be that.
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:18.320]   It would be literally how many miles could you drive...
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:19.320]   If you use a supercharger...
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.320]   For eight years.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.880]   But wait a minute.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:25.320]   If 20% of the time you use a supercharger and 80% of the time you home charged it.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:26.320]   Sure.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.320]   But you were driving as much as possible.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.320]   It's not going to be...
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.760]   You could probably ask Google.
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:32.520]   And not that many people are going to be using a Tesla drive...
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:34.720]   I bet you Wolfram Alpha could solve it.
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:35.720]   If you literally...
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:38.880]   All these brilliant tech guys...
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.400]   What people don't appreciate is they're all brilliant marketers.
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:43.400]   And this is just yet another example of...
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:44.400]   It is!
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.400]   No.
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:48.200]   Because the headline on the blog post doesn't say eight years or infinite miles.
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:50.280]   It says infinite mile warranty.
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:51.440]   No, I disagree.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:52.640]   I think everybody does...
[01:59:52.640 --> 02:00:00.880]   At least people in the valley realize that this whole industry is one massive sales scam.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:02.840]   Everything is sell, sell, sell.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:04.280]   And not only is it infinite.
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:08.520]   I'm going to make it retroactive to every model S ever sold.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:09.520]   How about that?
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.360]   The promise, the assumption that sales is bad.
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:17.480]   I mean if we're going to buy into the hype that we're quote unquote changing the world.
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:19.560]   Like that requires...
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:23.160]   Here's the best sales line in this blog post.
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.600]   I agree with that Ben.
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:26.080]   Here's the best line.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:33.000]   To investors in Tesla, I must acknowledge this will have a moderate...
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000]   That's easy for you to say.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.320]   This will have a moderately negative effect on Tesla earnings in the short term.
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.320]   Bull crap.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:41.520]   This is going to cost us money.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:43.400]   But we believe in doing this.
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:44.400]   Oh yeah.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.360]   In the tiny sliver of cars that are going to be over the old mileage number at before eight
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:51.640]   years really.
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:52.640]   He just does a warning.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.240]   Don't throw me in the briar.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:55.240]   This may be a...
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:01:01.680]   This may actually be an attempt to cover up some revenue problems in the next quarterly...
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:02.680]   Ah!
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:05.080]   It's because of our infinite mile warranty.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:06.080]   It's a nice piece of marketing.
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:07.080]   That's stock is so inflated.
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:08.080]   It's brilliant marketing.
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:09.080]   It's a nice piece of marketing.
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:10.080]   Because the headline...
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:11.080]   Drive as much as you want.
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:12.080]   We don't care.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.080]   Yeah.
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:14.600]   The headline everywhere is not infinite or eight years.
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:15.600]   It's infinite.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:17.360]   In fact, I'm looking at the headline.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:24.400]   It says here, "Model S drivetrain warranty increased to infinite miles.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:25.400]   It implies retroactively."
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.560]   Nobody else does that.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:27.560]   Nobody does that.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.560]   Who would do that?
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.200]   I'm going to make a car with a one year or infinite mile warranty.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.200]   Whichever comes first.
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:34.200]   Whichever comes first.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:35.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:36.400]   One year or infinite miles.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.960]   It's the same thing.
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:39.960]   All right.
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:41.480]   Pretty much.
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:42.480]   More bull crap.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:43.480]   It's good though.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:47.200]   I like this premise that basically all of Silicon Valley is just one big market scan.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.200]   You know where I find...
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.200]   I was at a party.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.200]   What big party?
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:51.200]   Scott Cook's place actually.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.200]   It was a big man.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.200]   Founder of Intuit.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:55.840]   And I was in the back and I had said something stupid.
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:57.040]   Apple board of directors.
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:59.480]   I had something stupid to say about, "Oh, you know what?
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:01.040]   This is good for the economy."
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:03.080]   And this guy went off on me with this.
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.080]   He says, "You're in the valley.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:08.640]   You don't realize that this is all a crock a crap.
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:12.080]   This whole system is set up just to extract people's money."
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.080]   It's a castle in the air.
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:14.080]   A house of cars.
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:15.080]   It is a scam.
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:16.680]   A pyramid scheme.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:20.640]   And I walked away from that very upset and then I realized he's right.
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:21.640]   So what?
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:22.640]   As Ben says.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:23.640]   That's your backup.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:24.640]   Nothing wrong with that.
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:25.640]   No, there's nothing wrong with that.
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:26.640]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.000]   As long as you get some of the action.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:29.800]   I just want a piece.
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:34.200]   Anyway, so I'm all in on that.
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:36.480]   I just want to tell everybody who watches this show.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:40.360]   This show is warranty for infinite miles.
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:46.840]   If anything should break in this podcast over the next eight minutes or infinite miles,
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:48.760]   I will view your money back.
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:50.240]   I thought it would be a week.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:51.680]   Until the next to it.
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.760]   Until the next to it.
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:53.760]   That's good.
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:55.800]   Ben Thompson stayed up later.
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:58.160]   Either that or got up early to join us this week.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:01.680]   It's like eight in the morning in beautiful Taiwan.
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:04.040]   Are you in Taipei?
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:05.680]   I'm right across the river from Taipei.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.680]   So he's the river.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.680]   He is the same Taipei.
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:08.680]   But you know what?
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:11.560]   He is a Taipei and that's why he writes a lot.
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:12.560]   That's your Taipei.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:13.560]   Zing.
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:14.560]   Zing.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.060]   How's the podcast?
[02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:17.060]   Brand new podcast.
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:18.060]   Exponent.
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:19.060]   How's it going?
[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:20.560]   It's going very well.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:23.200]   I thought we're up to 13, I think 13 episodes.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.440]   I just a little tip.
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:26.440]   Most podcasts are skip episode 13.
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.440]   Just go right to 14.
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:28.440]   But it's not true.
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:29.440]   Too late now.
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:30.440]   I've never heard that either.
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:31.440]   That's bull crap.
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:32.440]   Totally not true.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:34.080]   Okay.
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:38.840]   I give you an infinite warranty or 13 episodes, whichever comes first.
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:39.840]   Good.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.080]   I'm glad it's doing well.
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:45.240]   And it's the same kind of stuff you write about in Stretakerry.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:51.680]   To a degree, I think we're particularly interested in kind of the impact of tech on society.
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:56.600]   And I think a lot of stuff we talked about like for the Twitter stuff, for example, or
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.080]   BuzzFeed and the advertising we talked about this past week also kind of the effect that
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:04.720]   tech is having on jobs in the way that it's really upsetting a lot of-
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:05.720]   It's life.
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:06.720]   It's life.
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:07.720]   It's life.
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.720]   Tech is now life.
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:09.720]   We were talking-
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:13.080]   We were debating editorially whether we should cover Ferguson or not.
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:15.440]   And some are saying, well, it's a really, it's a big tweet story.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:17.920]   But of course, everything's a big tweet story now.
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.560]   And the fact that there is tech in any story does not make it, in fact, a tech story.
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:26.080]   Well, but that's the whole point though, is that I think tech kind of spends the first
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:28.320]   20, 25 years kind of eating itself, right?
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:33.120]   Like, you know, different kinds of startup to challenge other tech companies.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:38.480]   And now it really is infiltrating and affecting almost every industry.
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.320]   And that's going to have big consequences, not just economically, but also societally.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:44.160]   And that's kind of what we're focused on.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.360]   Actually, read with great interest.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:49.000]   And we didn't talk about it at your article, is Buzzfeed a tech company to debate?
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.960]   Is it a tech company or a media company?
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:51.960]   We debate that year.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:52.960]   It's a media company.
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.360]   Are we a tech company or a media company?
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.360]   We're a media company.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.360]   We're not a tech company.
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:57.360]   We use technology, but we're not-
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:04:58.360]   It doesn't.
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:01.920]   But Buzzfeed's getting valuations much more like a tech company.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:07.800]   The guy from Groupon was on the stage at the De-conference a few years ago.
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:10.640]   And a bunch of people said, well, wait a second, is Groupon really a tech company?
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:12.640]   It's a marketing company on the internet.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:14.200]   I mean, is Uber a tech company?
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:15.680]   Is Airbnb a tech company?
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:18.520]   I think none of them have companies.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.680]   Tech companies intel.
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:21.920]   Why does that matter?
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:22.920]   Whether it's a tech company-
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:24.320]   It's just a word, it's just a name.
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:25.320]   What does it matter?
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:26.320]   It matters to me.
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:27.320]   Because that's the point.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:28.320]   That's the point.
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.320]   That's what's changing.
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:30.320]   Yeah.
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:34.320]   It's like it used to be about Intel and Apple and Microsoft.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:38.560]   But now these new companies, they're not- And so when a new company come along, so
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:42.120]   Cisco is there and then Jupyter and I always come up and they're challenging Cisco.
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:44.480]   It's a tech versus tech sort of thing.
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:48.560]   Uber comes along, they're not looking to compete with another tech company.
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:51.200]   They're looking to compete with taxis and taxis.
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.840]   Maybe eventually UPS and VETX all this sort of stuff.
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:57.480]   With a backend that's tech enables, that couldn't exist for that deal.
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:59.480]   Well, it's not a tech company.
[02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:02.920]   Well, I mean, but the economics are our white tech companies.
[02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:03.920]   Let's say this for whether it is-
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:06.360]   Well, if the economics are like, I agree with you.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:09.360]   They are like, but that's part of a scam.
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:11.960]   And Leo, well, you got to close the show first?
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:12.960]   No, you close it.
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:13.960]   Leo, you're taking off.
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:14.960]   I got it.
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:15.960]   I have a tech company.
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:16.960]   Leo has to go pee.
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:17.960]   Well, I can-
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:18.960]   I can-
[02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:19.960]   Yeah.
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:20.960]   If you put me- put the camera on me, I can do it.
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:21.960]   I can say it as well as anybody else.
[02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:22.960]   So you got it?
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:23.960]   You got it.
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:24.960]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:25.960]   Oh.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:26.960]   All right.
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:30.480]   So thanks to our four sponsors today, Casper.
[02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:34.000]   They make mattresses and sell them to you on the internet and it comes in a little box.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.800]   Also stamps.com.
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:38.040]   Squarespace and Zip Recruiter.
[02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:39.040]   That is the end.
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:40.040]   Leo is in the bathroom.
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:41.040]   We'll see you later.
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:42.040]   Thank you, John de Borec.
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.080]   They thank me, yes.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:46.400]   For bringing the show and making it really happy.
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:47.800]   Well, don't forget yourself.
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:48.800]   And thanks to myself.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:49.800]   Thank you very much.
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.800]   Let's thank each other for a while.
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:51.800]   All right.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:52.800]   And then I can- I'll do the-
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:53.800]   Oh, well, he's-
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:54.800]   Ben Thompson.
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:55.800]   Thank you.
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:56.800]   Ben's been-
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:57.800]   Ben's been-
[02:06:57.800 --> 02:06:58.800]   Ben's been-
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.800]   Ben's been-
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:00.800]   Ben's been-
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:01.800]   I actually got the closeout by Leo.
[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:02.800]   So we can- you want to do it together?
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:03.800]   You want to do another-
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:04.800]   You go- you take it, man.
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:05.800]   You're here more than me.
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:06.800]   Okay, well, this is going to be it.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:09.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:10.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:11.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:12.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:13.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:14.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:15.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:16.800]   I'm going to do it.
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:19.800]   I'm doing a 3 ALS, but who am I going to challenge after this?
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:20.800]   All right.
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:21.800]   I know I'm going to challenge.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:22.800]   We're going to challenge.
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:23.800]   Wait, let's do it.
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:24.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:25.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:26.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:27.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:28.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:29.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:30.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:31.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:32.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:33.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:34.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:35.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:35.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:37.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:38.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:39.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:40.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:41.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:42.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:43.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:44.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:45.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:46.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:47.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:48.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:49.800]   Just spread the-
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:50.800]   Just spread the-
