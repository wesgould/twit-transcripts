[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.920]   It's time for Tuit this weekend tech
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.440]   to show the covers the latest tech news.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   But today, I don't know.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.000]   It's really going to be a show about the people on the show,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.560]   I think, because we have an all-star cast.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.120]   This is Tuit has been awaited for years.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.760]   Kevin Rose is here.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.600]   My good buddy, one of the original Twitters.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.560]   On show number one.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.960]   Show number one.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.920]   And of course, the founder of Dig and Dig Nation,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.760]   which is the number one podcast in all the world,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.720]   probably, at this point.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.360]   And we'll talk about Dig 4, the new Dig.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.600]   I know you've been kind of on the griddle on this one.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.360]   It's been crazy, crazy few days.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.760]   We'll talk, we'll talk.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.240]   I'm sure there's lots to say also with us,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.600]   Mr. Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.440]   Hello.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.640]   And the tech blog there.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.360]   Hey, Dwight, how are you?
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.280]   Very well, nice to have you here.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.960]   I'm excited to be on with this great lineup.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.080]   This is like one of the best lineups ever.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.960]   I agree.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.720]   You and I are the--
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.520]   I'm just going to step back and listen.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.080]   You and I will just throw him a question once in a while.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.960]   I'm also with us.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.200]   Robert Scobel, the Scobelizer.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.400]   Yo, yo, yo, yo.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   From sunny Half Moon Bay, it's a rarity.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.360]   Is it sunny out there?
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.860]   Wow.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.520]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.880]   Let me hear it.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.720]   I'll show you.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.560]   I wonder your weight is so unbalanced.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.120]   Look at that.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.920]   Greengrass and blue skies forever.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.400]   Nice to have you, Robert.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.120]   Yeah, it's been a while.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.360]   And somebody who hasn't been here in three years.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.840]   So it's been so long that people thought we hated each other.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.960]   Mr. Adam Curry.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.000]   Hey.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.440]   Hot talking.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   Hot talking guys.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   You know?
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.960]   That was amazing.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.800]   Of no agenda.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.600]   And his new show, The Big App Show, BigAppShow.com,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.000]   which is a very good idea.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.280]   It's a podcast.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.040]   But each one is-- each individual show is an individual app.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.600]   It's an app about apps, essentially.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   It's an app about apps.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   That's what I mean.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.760]   It looks like the app is running on your phone.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.360]   So it's better than looking at text descriptions and screenshots.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   Right.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.160]   Actually show you the app running and it looks full screen on your phone.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.560]   It's clever because, frankly, I think this is what everybody in content is doing, is writing
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.080]   an app around their content.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   You know?
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   Conde Nast.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.320]   I mean, this is what you do these days.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.160]   What I found amazing is that no one has really caught on to the idea of using an app as something
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.640]   for episodic programming.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.560]   You know, it's not like something you just download once and only does one thing.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.360]   I mean, update it with RSS feeds.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   And every day there's a new episode.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.480]   Well, musicians have done that.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.600]   I mean, you could buy albums that update themselves, things like that.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   True.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.120]   So the technology is there.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.080]   We do, you know, we have a Twitter app that, you know, has all the latest Twitch shows in
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   it.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   And with that, we're going to swing a pad app.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.080]   That's, that's my favorite.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.520]   I really like, oh, yeah, that's real good.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.200]   I wish a version like that was available for the iPhone.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.320]   I'd feature it for sure if it was on the iPhone.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.480]   There is one for the iPhone.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   Actually, same kind.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.120]   I haven't seen that same guy.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.680]   Like a shift key software.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   Really?
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.040]   Craig wrote it both first for the iPhone and then there's an iPad version, but I'll put
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.040]   it on this week.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   Thank you.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   Appreciate that.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   Sure.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   Lots of stories today.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040]   I don't even know where to begin.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.480]   I guess, well, let's talk a little bit about the news.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.320]   Then we'll talk about the personalities on the show.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   Give Kevin a break.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.200]   Where Kevin's been grilled for the whole week about Dig 4.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Oh, it's all good.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.080]   I love just on the record, Dig 4 is fantastic.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.640]   You know that because it's because that's kind of-
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   It's your idea.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   It was my idea.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   That's it.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   The feature set I wanted, but I know some of the Dig fans are not happy.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   We'll talk about that a bit.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.920]   But first we should start about with our old friend Paul Allen suing everybody except
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.400]   Microsoft.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.240]   And for some reason Amazon, claiming he basically owns every technology on the web.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.840]   I'm surprised he didn't sue you.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   He sued quite a few people, didn't he?
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.720]   The idea was that his company, Interval Research, which was a blue sky R&D company, I remember
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.120]   it was running while we were doing tech TV, Paul on tech TV.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.920]   Interval was going on while we did tech TV.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.120]   In fact, they closed it because it was just two blue sky.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.200]   They weren't creating any products.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.960]   Well, I guess they created some patents.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.920]   And now Paul is suing Google, Facebook, eBay.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:00.200]   Everybody, all the big players on this saying that he has the patents that basically are
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.000]   used to- I don't know.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.520]   It's kind of- There's such vague patents.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.160]   It's for processes like recommendation engines and stuff like that.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.760]   Which is odd that he didn't sue Amazon.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.760]   He sued Apple.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   I think Amazon's listed.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   Amazon's listed.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.400]   Here's the run back.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   I'm quite sure Amazon's listed.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.040]   Google, Facebook, eBay, Apple, Yahoo, AOL, Netflix, Office Depot, Office Mac, Staples,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040]   and YouTube.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   I got eBay.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   Not Amazon.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   No Amazon.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.040]   And no Microsoft.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.320]   Of course, Amazon uses Paul Allen technology.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.480]   And Microsoft is he's the major investor, obviously, one of the guys who started it.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.760]   Yeah, they probably- Is he Amazon as well?
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.400]   And the technology that Amazon uses that's Paul Allen Venture.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.800]   Microsoft also has 803 lawyers.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   Well, you'd think Google might have a lawyer or two in its back pocket.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.560]   I'm sure they do.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   Why is he suing Office Depot?
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.360]   I think that they've licensed it.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.000]   But they essentially have struck a deal with it and probably, you know, all Allen's been
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.480]   talking to Google and all these other folks for a while and maybe has not been able to
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.000]   score a hit with it.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.880]   But, you know, he's there in Seattle with Microsoft and Amazon and they're probably already licensed.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.360]   Is this an example of a patent troll?
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   Absolutely.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.840]   I mean, I can understand if he was going head to head with one of these companies and he
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.440]   was put out of business, you know, and they were using his patent and they had it fringed
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   on his patent and now he wants to, you know, get a little something back.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.720]   But the guy has a billionaire and he says, sitting there on these patents, why sue Office
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   Macs and Staples?
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.520]   Like, that's on his list of people he's suing.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   It's crazy.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.920]   So let's go back to the origin.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.640]   This is about business processes like the one click, which is the famous Amazon.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.320]   Amazon has that patent and has declined to pursue it.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.120]   I thought Apple paid for it.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.960]   Maybe they licensed it to a few people, but Amazon could have, I mean, everybody uses
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   one click.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   Amazon could have been much more aggressive.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.920]   I think what they decided, I remember that reading Jeff Bezos had decided, you know,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.080]   we're going to own it.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.080]   We're not.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.360]   We could go after people were not.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.240]   But obviously the shows that the patent and trademark office is severely broke.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.320]   It's screwed up.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   It's bad news.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.600]   So I do have a contrarian view on this though.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.320]   I'd like you to bear with me for a minute if I can try and roll it out for you, Leo.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.800]   Anybody with a voice with pipes like that can talk all day.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.960]   That's the war, son.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.160]   So I don't know Paul Allen.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.200]   I don't know if he's a nice guy or douchebag.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.360]   Do you call a douchebag?
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   He did.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.760]   He's not a douchebag.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.360]   He was kind of a doofus.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   Right.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.760]   Well, he's definitely smart.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   We know that.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.680]   He's probably not smart.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.840]   He's had some bad investments.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.680]   I would say he's not the smartest guy ever, man.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   We don't know.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   We can't tell.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680]   It's not in great health.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   No.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.040]   Well, he retired from Microsoft because he had Hodgkin's lymphoma, but he seems to have
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   recovered from that.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.920]   I think that that actually was a pretty good move on his part because he got out of Microsoft
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.800]   took the stock with him and now has a giant submarine and ship.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   So take this.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.080]   Let's try this on for size.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.760]   Let's say you're Paul Allen.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   You don't know.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.280]   You've had a near-death experience.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.000]   I guess it could be terminal.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.480]   You want to work on your legacy.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.120]   I think the tip-off is actually that he didn't list Microsoft and Amazon in his lawsuit because
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.760]   he didn't want to give them any hassle.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.760]   Here's why.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.960]   I think Paul Allen is actually a patriot in the truest sense of the world.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   Oh my God.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   I'm bearing.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   I'm bearing.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.160]   I don't know if I'm with you, but I'm bearing.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.960]   So we know that this patenting of software and the way the patent trademark office run
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.720]   is severely broken.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   So what if he went after?
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.760]   I mean, if you want to really for once and for all get rid of these stupid patent lawsuits,
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.480]   the best way is to get the biggest tech companies on the planet and all of their legal teams
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.200]   and have them all band together to prove that your patents are stupid.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.640]   Well, maybe that's why we have the patent laws.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   Yes.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.080]   Yeah, we have jurisprudence that these patents are bogus and maybe he's doing this as his
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.360]   final legacy for the world and saying, let's just have every, like all the lawyers Google
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   app.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.120]   I mean, Facebook, all these guys, of course they're going to win.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.860]   They're going to prove that no way these patents you have are bogus, which will immediately
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.400]   obfuscate any other stupid patent and software.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.840]   I think the guy is in genius.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.840]   They will win.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.640]   They're going to win.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640]   Look at the law firm.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.640]   They've got Sussman.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.640]   What is it?
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.800]   Some ranking firm, Sussman Godfrey, who represent little guys against oil companies.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.280]   That's the interval research attorneys.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   That's the ones.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.160]   Yeah, that's not a small firm.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   That's not a big firm.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.400]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.000]   So either you might be a good theory, Adam.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.120]   Most of your stuff is crackpot, but that, yay.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   I don't know.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   You're pretty.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.040]   You should play the Hot Pocket sound.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.960]   Don't ask a request for that.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   Go on out to the white everybody.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.880]   But think about it.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.760]   If you had nothing but money and you could drag all these guys into a fight, and of
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.040]   course Google and Apple, though, we will fight this vigorously.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.840]   I wish someone would say something different.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   That was it.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   We will fight this.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.840]   It has no merit.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.720]   Why don't they just say it's a douche bag?
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.000]   That'll be much simpler.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.640]   And I think that's exactly what he's doing.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.240]   He's trying to prove once and for all that these patents are no good, and he's going
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.040]   to get the biggest guys in the world to prove it.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.080]   And then they're going to turn around and go, oh, wait a minute, we can't actually sue
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.600]   people over our bogus patents anymore, including that douche bag.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.440]   Yes, who has the podcast patent.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440]   What is the status of that?
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.080]   Well, he's just sitting there.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.960]   He's ready to troll, right?
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.960]   That's why.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.520]   So no, if I call him net cast, am I off the hook?
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.560]   No, because he's still a podcast.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:59.600]   He has patented episodic subscriptions and he was awarded VRSS or the business process
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.080]   of episodic content delivered by subscription.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.400]   This has been kind of a sort of damocles hanging over the industry's head for about
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   two years now.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.640]   And he's not done anything about it, but yeah, he's just sitting there.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.480]   So I hope all Alan is doing a great job in this.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.320]   He's waiting for somebody to become big enough to be worth suing.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   That's Leo.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.320]   Absolutely.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   Absolutely.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   And Leo, your number one.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   That's one thing.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.560]   I'm just pulling my head down.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.960]   For the record Leo's show is five times the size of dignity.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.000]   So here comes Leo.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Oh, god.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.440]   No, that's probably what he's waiting for, right?
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.280]   I mean, maybe you could sue Yahoo or Google or somebody.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.880]   But if there was one reform, I'd like to see come out of this is that you're not allowed
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.240]   to sue after two years of somebody breaking your patent, you know, of using your patented
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.240]   idea that way.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.680]   Why not just make software?
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.720]   You know, why don't I just make software copyrightable?
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   That's different.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.280]   I think it's writing its words.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.200]   You write it in a, you know, people write it in an ID or a text editor.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.600]   I think it's copyrightable.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.200]   That'd be great because then we have, you can even copyright that under creative commons.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.520]   It's all set up, you know, the whole idea of this trademarking or patenting is ludicrous
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.680]   and it's actually stifling innovation.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   Totally agree.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.880]   Well, you know, it's interesting to go back and look at why the patent office was invented.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:32.440]   It was actually invented to try to stimulate innovation and get more people to invent things.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.760]   And it's now being used against innovators.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:46.160]   Let us, let us actually, you know, our friend Kevin here just had, was it a T with Jonathan
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.160]   Ive?
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160]   No.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   So here's the story.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.440]   Basically, so Johnny, Johnny Ive, I guess he goes by Johnny.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   Johnny, J.O.N.Y.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:02.720]   Johnny Ive, Johnny Ive of Apple fame of creating the iMacs and iPads and iPhones and the main
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   head designer.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.080]   One of our guys that did reach out to him and said, hey, do you want to go have lunch?
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.720]   You want to grab a coffee?
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.800]   And he wrote back and he was like, yeah, sounds good.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   What a good idea.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   I know.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.200]   So here's the problem though.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:21.900]   We are about to go visit him and he writes us on Friday that he had to jump into a meeting
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.400]   with jobs and he couldn't make it.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.160]   So we're rescheduling for next week.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160]   So you haven't had it yet.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   Haven't had it yet.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   But will you Twitter?
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   Will you force square?
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   Will you go Walla?
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.000]   I will definitely take a picture or two.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.080]   I told him he can bring Steve if he wants to.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   That's fine.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   I'm Johnny Ives, nowhere tight t-shirts.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   I'm Johnny Ives.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   I invented that.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   I dissolved into double.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.880]   Are you doing this at the Apple headquarters?
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.160]   We were going, actually we're meeting at a place around the corner from Apple.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.920]   So there you can actually shoot a picture because when I've had lunch with employees
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.320]   out there, they don't let me take pictures.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.520]   Yeah, they're very secret and very secret little spot.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.520]   That's so cool, man.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.520]   I'm jealous.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.000]   I'm sure the employees I get to hang out with are open carry nuts who want to take me to
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.800]   the shooting range.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.480]   No, I think that this is, you know, they often say, oh, you know, if you had one person
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.880]   you could interview, who would it be?
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.400]   I think John Ives is absolutely one of them.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.960]   I mean, he's in my top five for sure.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   The guy who designed the iPod, the iPhone.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   I'm not beer.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   You're holding Leo.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   I designed it.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   I'm Johnny Ives.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.400]   So I love this theory.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.720]   Kevin, you wrote a little bit about it that Wednesday, Apple's got a big announcement.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.880]   It could be just, you know, more iPods, but there's a lot of theorizing that there'll
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.280]   be an iPod touch with the front facing camera, the retina display.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.720]   That seems reasonable.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.560]   Obviously, an updated nano.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.360]   Some people say it'll be square, but here's a real question.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.440]   You said, and I think I agree with you and I TV might be a really good move.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.040]   I heard you talking about that.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.760]   I think last week on Twitch was the last week.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   Boy, I hope so.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   Fantastic.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:07.680]   If you get your content through apps and wasn't didn't job say at the de-conference that you
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.760]   had to circumvent the whole cable industry and other than getting your bandwidth, obviously,
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.000]   I think it's great.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.960]   And I for content producers as well wouldn't be great to just fire up.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   You're doing it.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   You're doing it.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   Exactly.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.160]   You're ahead of the game.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.880]   So Kevin's post is why Apple's ITV will change everything on Kevin Rose's blog.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.480]   And I couldn't agree more with you, Kevin.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.200]   Why don't you kind of summarize what you think?
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.040]   Well, I've heard the rumors like everyone else about the different things that are coming
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   to ITV.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.440]   Apparently, this is going to be like a $99 device.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:44.400]   So something that's within the price range of an average consumer.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.120]   And the device will be iOS powered.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.560]   So the same OS that powers the iPhone, the iPad, it's just going to run on this device.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.960]   Which opens up the whole app library too.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   Right.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   Exactly.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.400]   All they have to do is recompile it, takes five minutes and boom, your app is working
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.960]   on your ITV.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.560]   But the interesting thing is that some of the stuff I was thinking about was we already
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.360]   have these other devices like our iPhone iPad.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.840]   These can instantly be remotes and controls and give us an interface to interact with the
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.840]   ITV.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.840]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.640]   There's a game on iPad called Chopper too.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   It's a hell of a flying game.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.640]   Love it.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640]   Which you control with the iPhone.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   You control with the iPhone.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.640]   It's just sitting there and staring.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   Love it.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.520]   Well, more than that, this Magic trackpad, which kind of doesn't really have a use case,
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.440]   like a big trackpad, now it makes sense.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.160]   That's a $60 peripheral with a sit back interface.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.160]   Right.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.840]   Sit back on yourself and now control your ITV with it.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.360]   I mean, I just think that it opens up a whole different range of users.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.320]   My mom would love an ITV if I could instantly take a picture of myself and friends and then
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.560]   say publish to my feed and then it goes out to my dot me all of a sudden.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.200]   She turns on the TV, gets a notification, pictures are waiting, videos waiting.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.320]   Just another, I mean, it's about time.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.560]   So Kevin, if you only have 200 bucks this Christmas to spend, do you buy the Xbox connector?
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560]   Do you buy this ITV?
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   Ooh, that's a tough one.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   ITV.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   Yeah, I'm going.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.360]   First of all, Kevin's got a little more than 200 bucks to spend this Christmas.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   Second of all.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.200]   I just wanted to put some constraints on it.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.680]   No, I think the ITV is going to, but now wait a minute because there's also Google TV,
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.520]   which is going to have many similar features, be controlled by Android phones instead of
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.520]   iPhones.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.520]   Right.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   It's easy to do horse race.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.600]   Well, I was funny.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.280]   I was at Google just a week ago and they were talking about, you know, some of the people
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.120]   wrote in and said, Hey, come check out the Google TV.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.640]   Want to show your box, blah, blah, blah.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   Could they get it working?
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   I don't know.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.200]   It didn't work so well.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.120]   What's really weird to me is that, so one of the things I've been thinking about is
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.600]   that they have this new Chrome OS coming out, right?
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.760]   And this is based off of Linux is kind of like based around the Chrome browser.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   It's a browser.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.480]   It is a browser, right?
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.360]   So, but then they have Android apps and that OS.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.960]   So why have both?
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.200]   To me, like, why don't they just stick with the Android OS, make that kind of like the
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.760]   OS that runs anywhere, allow to run on their Google TV, allow to run on, you know, a laptop,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   whatever it may be.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.200]   We've debated this on this week in Google, our show about Google and the consensus I think
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.520]   we've come up with is, well, they, it's like two tries.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.400]   Why not develop two and figure out which one's going to make it.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.920]   Well, you can make it's no contest on Android's.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.920]   It's not on the hard run.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920]   It's between Android's.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.440]   I mean, no contest between Apple and Google.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.280]   Apple knows how to talk to the consumer and they're going to have the right price point,
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.640]   the right offering, the interface is going to be going to be great.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   You know what they have?
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   They have the store.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   They have the store.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.640]   That's what really makes it.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.960]   Well, the interface, the money, the money loop closed.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   Absolutely.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.920]   The interface, Adam, I actually think is a great point because I was one of these Google
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.440]   engineers that I had lunch with.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.960]   They said to me, one of the things we're not good at is making things sexy.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.440]   Like we can't make.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440]   Or reusable.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440]   Right.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440]   So they understand that.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.440]   They don't have the designers.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   They don't have Johnny Ives.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.440]   They also don't have the supply chain.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.280]   I mean, I visited China and actually visited some of the Apple supply chains, the companies
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.200]   that make Apple stuff.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.880]   And Apple has the best supply chains wrapped up.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.400]   They're not going to go to work for somebody else.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.200]   When people say, well, what's going to happen after jobs disappears from Apple, that's the
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.520]   number one thing that's going to keep Apple important is that supply chain and their ability
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.840]   to make these cool devices and chip them in high volume.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.440]   The other thing I'm also has.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440]   Go ahead.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.920]   I was just going to say the other thing I'm really excited about is the idea of how this
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.680]   is going to change the cable and satellite industry.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.840]   Well, it disintermediates them.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.040]   It changes them into bandwidth plays instead of premium product.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.520]   They have to be squashed.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.840]   They've had to monopoly for a week too long.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.280]   I don't know if they're going to go easily.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   I go.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.280]   Guys, they won't go.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   They will not go easily.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   They're going to fight literally.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.280]   And they've already started bandwidth caps.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.480]   Why do you think Ken Comcast is a 250 gig bandwidth cabinet?
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.260]   Not because they right now, anybody would use that much, but because if you start watching
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.480]   TV on your ITV, you'll quickly hit that.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.640]   So there's one.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.320]   And then of course net neutrality.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.680]   They've already decided they're going to they'll gate this stuff if they have to.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   So they're going to go down.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.880]   This is where Google has the huge advantage because they're also in the pipe business.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.400]   So Google has some real interesting plays going on.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.840]   You can see it now with what they're doing with the house yet.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   Not yet.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   Not yet.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   Google doesn't have pipes to my house.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.400]   I live only 45 minutes away from the headquarters.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.120]   I think if Google wanted to do that, they would have bid harder on the 700 megahertz
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.120]   spectrum.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.640]   I think that they showed that they either don't have the guts or the will to become a
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.120]   bandwidth player.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.360]   They could have.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.880]   They put the 4.6 billion down, but they didn't pull the trigger on it.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.600]   They let Verizon and AT&T split that band.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.080]   And that was basically saying, well, we're not in it to play.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:45.600]   And now, of course, this net neutrality deal, they've brokered with Verizon.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.000]   They're showing really that they don't have the guts to do it, I think.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.960]   Well, at Leo also, they, you know, Apple has the relationships with the kind of people
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   that do content.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.000]   You know, they've all they kind of have a history of working with the music industry
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.480]   and somewhat with the music industry.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   That's who that's who that's.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.160]   Except the stuff that I've read recently, I think there was a Wall Street Journal piece
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:12.640]   that basically said that only a couple of studios are in on the, on the, I think they're going
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640]   to launch.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.600]   They're going to launch it and that they're not able necessarily to, you know, at the
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.680]   moment to score anything.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.320]   I don't they don't have to be in on it, by the way, because let me tell you why.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   They've got their own plays.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   They've got Hulu.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   Let's say just Hulu plus.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.000]   Well, now instead of doing a deal with Apple and being on the Apple store at 99 cent rental,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   they make an app.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.200]   They charge you 10 bucks a month.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   They don't need Apple.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   Apple.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.200]   Apple's collects its 30%.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   And Apple is talking to them.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   I mean, yeah, sure.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.320]   Apple wants to put together a play, but I don't think Apple has to put together a play to make
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   this compelling.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.920]   I mean, this is already this is already working though.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.080]   I mean, when, when I have my iPad and the lost season was finishing up, you're watching,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.960]   I was watching on the ABC app.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.200]   I was watching lost and they had their little ads that ran every, you know, five minutes
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   or whatever it may be.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.480]   And in the future, if it's 99 cents an episode, I'll click buy it now.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   It'll go through instantly through the Apple store.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   It's not.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.480]   No, I have a mirror.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.840]   I'm very skeptical about this.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   I mean, I know what it takes to produce television shows and movies.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.240]   And they say, you know, in Hollywood, where I reside now, the joke is, you know, exchanging
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.800]   real dollars for digital dimes, you know, it's just not enough money.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   It really isn't.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   And that's what cable companies.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.200]   That's what the unionization of the, of the motion.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   Well, they're out of business.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   Then they're out of business.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.240]   That's what cable companies say is they say, we can't make it as a bit provider.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.040]   We have to sell premium services or we don't have, there's no model for us.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.840]   I think it's why Verizon put Fios all over the country.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.360]   I think that how about Google teaming up with Verizon to distribute content that doesn't
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.640]   network that would work?
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:45.040]   Yeah, it would, it would work where Verizon is, which isn't everywhere.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.120]   The other thing is that, that with, I think that ITV will happen eventually.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.200]   I think that they will iterate it.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.560]   I don't think you're going to see that Wednesday.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560]   I don't think they're ready.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.360]   Boy, the guitar on the invite kind of means to me that it's an iPod and maybe I life
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.960]   and they would have put something in.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.200]   Please, a better iTunes application.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   That's not going to happen.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.720]   I went to a table read of a family guy.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.040]   That must have been one.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.840]   Which was the most awesome experience ever.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.520]   That must have been someone to see Seth McFarland do all the voices.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.480]   So all the actors and all the writers that are table and they go through the episode.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.200]   And you just 80 people who work on that show?
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.200]   Wow.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   80 people.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.640]   I mean, how can you afford that with these little monthly subscriptions?
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   I just don't see it happening.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   I'm curious, though.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.600]   I mean, when you take a look at watching an actual ad on television, like what's the
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   CPM on that?
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.600]   Like how much do they actually get paid for that versus...
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.200]   I could destroy this whole argument versus 50 cents a download.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   B-O.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   H-B-O.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.960]   They make multi-million dollar productions.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.840]   True blood is a very expensive show.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.080]   Sopranas, very expensive show.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.080]   No ads.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.080]   All subscription.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.360]   H-B-O makes an H.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.920]   It's the cable company's pay per user that per subs...
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   And the cable company...
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.560]   And that took 20 years to get to that point.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.560]   It's going to take no time.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.760]   HBO makes an app.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.760]   They charge you $15 instead of the $40.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.560]   What is it you pay the cable company for HBO?
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.560]   They get all the money instead of giving some of the money to the cable company.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.320]   And they monetize that way.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   I do that in a second.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   I pay for that.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   Absolutely.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.520]   And especially if it's on your big screen as well as your iPad, right?
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.520]   I think the app...
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.520]   There will be winners.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.620]   I think the app model makes sense.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.160]   My question is, okay, I'm the cable guy.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.800]   I'm the guy who owns the pipe.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.880]   You're about to take away the biggest slice of my business.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   You hike up the van with the house.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.880]   What do I do to fight it?
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   Well, how do I...
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.120]   Yeah, you got to hike up the cost for van with.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.200]   So they're going to lose those monthly subscriptions.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.000]   I canceled my TV thing a long time ago.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.080]   I pay for a direct ticket, which is the NFL stuff.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.080]   And I don't get anything else.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.400]   And everything else I can sue them online.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.880]   How much you pay for a direct ticket?
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   That's expensive.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.880]   It's like, come on our box.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.760]   So for, say, 50 bucks a year, you put it on your ITV?
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760]   I'm in.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.760]   Done.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.920]   They get all the money.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.920]   They're done.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   They don't have this...
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   It's disintermediation.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.560]   That's what the internet does.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.320]   But the problem is the intermediation is the cable companies and the telcos.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.720]   These guys are not going down easy.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   They're going down.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   That's going to be kind of scary.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.920]   I agree that it's a really, really bad precedent.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.880]   The last week Comcast went out in the North Bay.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   It was down for six, seven hours.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   We know this place.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.880]   Because we're not a stuff-out-one.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.680]   We couldn't do no agenda.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   That's right.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   It was up a line.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680]   It was very annoying.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.840]   But yeah, it used to be just dial into another ISP or whatever.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.600]   Now I got to get an AT&T DSL.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   It sucks.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.240]   There's limited partners that you can go to.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.840]   So I guess the question is, if the cable companies, if the bandwidth providers decide
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:53.240]   to play hardball, is this why Google's doing the gigabit ethernet fiber optic in four cities?
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.120]   Who comes along and competes with them?
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.560]   The sys admins of the world unite and build the mesh network between all Wi-Fi base stations.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.560]   Yes.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.640]   That would be amazing.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.040]   That would be awesome, wouldn't it?
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.120]   I think this is a great topic.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.160]   We can talk some more about it.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.360]   Dig four, of course.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.640]   There's plenty of other news.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.280]   Kevin Rose is in studio.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.080]   It's so great to have my old friend here.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.080]   Great to have you.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   Thank you for bringing two six packs for the two of us.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   I think that's a drinking to deal with.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   I think that should do.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.240]   I think we're doing audible now.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.160]   I'll do what you want to do audible now.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160]   We'll do audible.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.160]   All right, hold on.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.240]   Dwight Silverman is also here from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.200]   Robert Scobel, he's not from anyone.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.840]   He's just, what is that?
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   It's my app.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.840]   You have a camera app?
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.120]   No, I have my own app.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   You can, yeah, that's right.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.320]   It's like Adam Curry has an app.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   I have an app.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   I need an app.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320]   You need an app, Kevin.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   We're the dig.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   We have to take this app.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.520]   You need a Kevan Rose app.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520]   Everybody.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.960]   That's the future, by the way.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.560]   Forget domain names.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.720]   Forget brand names.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.040]   It's all about individual.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.040]   I want a Leo app.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   You get a Kevin app.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.040]   Adam's got an Adam app.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   We've got a scoble app.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   What would you have to do?
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.680]   It doesn't matter what it does.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.200]   I talk about me, man.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   It's like tickle me.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   I actually tickle me Leo.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   It tickle me Leo.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   It'll be all about Kevin Rose.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.040]   We've been blowing the microphone in your dress shoes up.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.640]   We actually did that, I think, on the kill episode of this conversation.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.400]   A mobile road he built my app for me.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.640]   You should talk to them.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:23.160]   Well, I do think that that may be the kind of the ultimate future is complete disintermediation
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.160]   where you don't even have a big company anymore.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.880]   Individuals have their own apps because the app is demarcating.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.000]   It's completely democratizing, isn't it?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That's exactly it.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.480]   It's so much fun, Leo, because I do the camera, the editing, everything.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.200]   I did a program by myself, but I found all these little companies that would help me
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   out.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.840]   There's this company Tap Links that has a framework, which is an RSS aggregator.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.120]   I found some guy, actually some guys who do design work and they design some stuff for
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   me.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.680]   Now, I've got a guy working on an Android version.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.680]   It's great.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.760]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   Look at you, man.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.360]   You've got a little one-man shop, really.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.480]   You've got some infrastructure, but I think we're disintermediating all the big companies,
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.800]   particularly when it comes to media.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.240]   I think it's going to spread out into the edges.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.760]   It'll come back eventually.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.960]   It'll be centralized again, but for the next five or ten years.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.440]   Does it need to be?
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.840]   What is the advantage of centralization?
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.120]   It used to be marketing and distributing.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.680]   But the distribution is available to everybody.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.360]   Marketing, they don't do doodly-dod for crying out loud anyway.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:33.880]   Teams, it's getting harder and harder to compete as a single guy for certain kinds of things.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.600]   But these are first, but Adam just said it.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.840]   They're virtualized teams.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.800]   You join, they break up, they ebb and flow as needed.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.120]   You get the team that you need for the moment you need it, and then you move on.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.040]   Everybody has a core competency.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.080]   You go to the people with a core competency.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.440]   It's like Elance, the ultimate.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.200]   You just find what you need, you pair up when you need it, and then you're done.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   You move on.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.280]   It still costs a little bit of money to buy a studio.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.920]   I got $300 worth of lights.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.920]   It's almost nothing now.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.160]   I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.640]   Robert, let me tell you something.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.240]   How much did the Tech TV studio cost?
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   We had two control rooms.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.400]   We had $2 million control rooms.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.320]   We had a million dollars set for Tech Live.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.640]   You say it costs something, Robert.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   It's true, but it costs such a fraction of what it used to.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   Absolutely.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.080]   I've done shows with just my laptop, just the speaker.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.320]   It's going to cost less and less and less.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.520]   Leah, you've said it before.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:30.480]   The only differentiator, the only thing it'll come down to is content.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.480]   Making the content.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.880]   It's like everyone's all, "Oh, Apple could come in and do that big app show."
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.880]   I say, "Well, go ahead.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.640]   Let them find someone who knows how to do it."
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.680]   I've been doing segments for videos for 25 years.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.000]   I don't care whether it's White Snake or the Gate Guru app.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.160]   I can do it all.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.240]   It's the guys who blew up that club in Providence.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   Gate Guru?
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   No, White Snake.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.520]   No, no, that was great White.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.520]   Great White.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.520]   I confused them.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   Sorry.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:04.440]   So overall, the nature of business is that things break up and then they come back together
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.440]   against bigger pieces and then dissolve and break up.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.000]   Nature does the same thing.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.400]   We're in a period right now where the current structure is being taken apart, but Adam's
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.960]   White, eventually everything will be centralized.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.600]   We'll have another round 20 or some out media companies.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   I disagree.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   It'll be done differently.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.120]   It will be done differently, but we'll have them again.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.040]   The idea is that there's an economy of scale, right?
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.720]   But I think what's changed is in this digital universe, these digital tools don't benefit
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.360]   from or don't require the economy of scale because we are now spread out completely.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.760]   We don't need to be in any one spot.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.400]   Paul Graham talks about how stupid, how foolish the idea of building an office with cubicles
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.400]   in it.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.840]   It's very industrial age, the idea where you've got to have your employees there so you can
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.600]   watch them, make sure that they're putting out 13 sweaters a day or whatever it is.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.320]   It's very interesting that tech stars and dog patch labs is doing that and not because
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.440]   they want to watch the employees, but because there is some value of having a lot of people
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.000]   in one place, so ideas can get shared easier.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.360]   Yeah, you can use technology like Skype.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:18.320]   But in fact, I visited Simple Geo in Boulder, Colorado and they have an office in San Francisco
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.440]   and they have a live Skype that's always on an LED for that reason.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   For that reason, right?
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.920]   Those are a lot of diggies doing them, right?
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.080]   Yeah, I like they, Simple Geo business.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.120]   But I think that the decentralization for a while is definitely what's going to happen.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.280]   It's even happening here in Hollywood.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.760]   I'm doing an app with Eli Roth.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.640]   I mean, the guy's like, "Well, I just did my movies.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   This is great.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.760]   I don't want to do something else and I can't really make money on movies anymore."
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   It's really hard.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.880]   DVD sales are in the tank and he wants to move to the app model.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.360]   It's pretty clear that humans like to congregate.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.440]   So that's not going to go away.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.920]   We're social beings.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.920]   I talked about my dad's a college professor and 15 years ago, we talked about the future
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.120]   of the university.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.960]   He said, "You don't need the library.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.600]   You don't need the lectures.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.640]   You need the collegium.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.800]   Originally universities, there weren't professors and students.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.920]   It was scholars gathering together to talk."
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   So that will continue.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.920]   I don't think that's going away.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.080]   I think that's why you have communal workspaces.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.720]   You know WordPress is a really good example of someone that's done a great job at this.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.280]   I think WordPress has, I can't remember it last, but it's in the 20 or 30 employee kind
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   of account.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   And they're all remote.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.880]   But they fly together like once or twice a year.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   They all get together.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.320]   They do their little brainstorming pow wow and everything else is IRC.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.600]   Is it a negative do you think?
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.840]   They seem to be doing very well and they love it.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.720]   I mean you get to work from home or a cafe or anywhere else that you want and different
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.640]   developers will get together in the same city.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.800]   But overall they've said nothing but good things about it.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   Let's talk about your ad Leo.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.920]   Yeah, let's talk about Audible.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.960]   And then this is such a good conversation.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.480]   I hate to interrupt it.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.560]   But it's not an interruption to talk about Audible Audible.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.520]   That great site that I talk about all the time where you can listen to, this is the kind
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.880]   of thing Audible is all about is expanding your mind.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.920]   Adding to great ideas from great thinkers throughout the ages or being entertained by
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.160]   great literature.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.960]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.520]   I just did a count almost there very close now to 80,000 books.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.240]   And you can get two of them for free.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   Go ahead.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.080]   I've been a fan of audio books.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   Wow.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   Since.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.560]   How many think did they were they on that first Rio player?
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.560]   They were very good.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.320]   That was my first Audible player.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   Yep.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:38.480]   And now it's gotten a little less because now I'm kind of balancing between podcasts and
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.800]   also I do also like iBooks.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.560]   But Audible, particularly if you get something like a really weighty book.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.080]   Here's one that I just got.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.520]   Now I've been a member for a long, long, long time.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.160]   She's must be six, seven years by now that I've had an Audible account.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.960]   And 63 hours worth of.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.880]   By Ayn Rand.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.920]   I recommend it.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.640]   You're such an objectivist.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   No.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.360]   Is that your philosophy?
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   Is that your philosophy?
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.360]   Do you like this?
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   No, no, not at all.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.080]   But I really, really enjoyed the book because actually my fiance would turn me on to it.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.480]   She bought it for me.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.480]   And she said, you know, you are John Galt.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   I'm like, what?
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.640]   Yeah, you are.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.120]   And then, and then I read this book.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   And she dagnie.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.120]   She dagnie tag her.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.120]   What was the name of the woman?
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.120]   It's a dagnie.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.840]   It's going to be Hank because they have a couple of hot sex scenes and some really
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.840]   hot stuff.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   Which is not read really hot in this particular version of Audible.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.800]   And then he un-sought into my blouse.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.440]   And it's a hot scene.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.440]   Yeah, you read that.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.440]   Lish rug tapping.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   I love that Lish rug.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   But it is long.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.440]   As you said, 63 hours, I think, on the offer.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.440]   Scott Brick does it.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.760]   He's one of my favorite Audible narrators.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.760]   He's good.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.760]   He's good.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.760]   This could be yours for free.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.760]   And then you get another one.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.600]   So why not get this in the fountainhead?
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   Let's see.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   That's 60 hours.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.600]   And another one, absolutely.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.120]   That's 32 hours.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.560]   So almost 100 hours from the great Leonard Cohen record jumping the bathtub and pulling
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.560]   the toast.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.560]   Tell yourself.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.840]   Look, Audible's got everything.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.840]   It's got Anne Rand.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.840]   It's got mysteries.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   It's got thrillers.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.280]   It's got the girl with a dragon tattoo, that whole millennium.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.280]   Did you seem like you'd be the guy who would like the Stig Larson?
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.640]   I haven't read it yet.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.120]   Kevin, you got to read him.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.120]   Oh my God.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.120]   Well, this is the way you listen to him.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:29.120]   And nowadays we're busy.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   You don't have time to read a book.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   You want to go to sleep.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   You don't have time to turn pages.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   Listen in your car when you're driving around.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.120]   Listen on the high speed train.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.120]   On the high speed train.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   Perfect.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   There's no high speed trains in LA.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   They will.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.120]   They're coming.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   They will.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.120]   In the year 25, 25.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.120]   We're building them.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   Like I said, in the year 25.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   Not rock climbing because you got to listen to your Blair.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   Otherwise, they'll drop.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   But at the gym for sure.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   I'm running in the treadmill.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120]   Blay on!
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   What?
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   Blay on!
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.120]   I'm listening to Anne Rand.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.120]   Do you mind?
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.120]   In the weight room.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.120]   The treadmill.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.120]   The treadmill.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.120]   Which is the most boring looking.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   There's nothing more boring.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   It's a pretty cool time.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   Then the treadmill.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   The stairmaster.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.120]   The bicycle.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   You got to have something.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   That's where Audible really is.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   Great.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.120]   Audible.com.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.120]   Now, these will play on almost anything.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   They just added their zoom support.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   They just added Android support.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   But the Android app is really slick.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.120]   You've got your whole library on there.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.120]   You can get any book.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   Same thing on the iPhone now.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.120]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   Two books.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120]   Could be yours.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.120]   A hundred hours.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:37.120]   I think that might, you might have taken the cake there, Adam, for the longest Audible representation.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.120]   The longest book on Audible.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   How do they make money on that?
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:45.120]   I mean, it's only, first of all, you get two free if you go to Audible.com/twit2.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.120]   And I guess any book, right?
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.120]   So, Adler Shrug would be one of your two.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.120]   You get a credit.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   I think even sometimes these long books are, let's see, you know what?
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   I'm going to sort by running time.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   The longest books on Audible.com.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   This is the way to buy.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.120]   Buy your books by the pound, you know, by running time.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.120]   Let's see, I'm going on vacation.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.120]   I'll have seven days in the sun.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.120]   Let me just stack it up.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   Here's one.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.120]   The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shire.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   I read that.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   It was a great book, 57 hours.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   That's one credit.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.120]   You could have that.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.120]   I'm just looking.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.120]   I think the longest book on there, 63 hours, I think is the longest I'm looking.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.120]   I've done it.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.120]   You've actually broke it a record here.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   Dune is only 21 hours.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   I think you got it.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   I think you did it.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   And even for the women out there, how about...
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.120]   Is that unaudible?
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.120]   And for the ladies.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.120]   Yes, it is.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   It is.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.120]   It is.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120]   You'd love prayer.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   Actually, I have it on my...
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   I'm listening to it as well.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   It's got to be better than the movie.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   Did you... I like Julia Roberts eating pashuto.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.120]   What's wrong?
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   What could be wrong with that?
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   Well, you know what happened?
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   I went to see it at six o'clock.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.120]   It was great because you go to the director's guild and they have, you know, a theater the way it's supposed to be.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.120]   It's beautiful.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.120]   Oh, they're screening roles, yeah.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.120]   Yeah, it's a screening that was really good.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.120]   And I hadn't eaten.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120]   And then at first it's...
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   She's in Rome and there's all this food.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.120]   It's very hard to make food look good on camera, but this look really good.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   It looks good.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   And so for the whole pray and love part, my stomach was growling.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   I'm hungry.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   I'm like, "Let's get out of here.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   I need some pasta."
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   He left pray even better.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.120]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Adam, I know what you're doing.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.120]   You're auditioning for Audible, aren't you?
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.120]   Oh, he'd be great.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.120]   Let me tell you what I would love.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   I would love to do audio books.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   I've actually done a couple just for myself, but I didn't really want to release them.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.120]   I've done Tom Swift because that's on the good phone.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120]   Oh, how fun.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   I've read that as a kid and Tom Swift and his electric grandmother and as his hovercraft.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   And I loved reading Tom Swift.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.120]   And so I've actually read a...
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.620]   I think it is the hovercraft one that I read and I edited and everything, but it's hard.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.620]   You really need a producer to do that right.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.120]   Really hard to do about yourself.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.620]   Corey, I did a story for Corey Doctor or one of his short stories.
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.620]   He's actually doing an audio release.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.120]   It should be out soon, I think.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120]   I love his short stories.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   Neil Gaiman reads one of his short stories.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   I do.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.120]   They're a bunch of people.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   And I had to do it two or three times.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.120]   You're right.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   You need somebody sitting there saying, "slow down."
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   You mispronounced that.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   That voice changed.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   He was a Scotsman last time you said.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.120]   It's hard.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.120]   That Corey Doctor story where Sisad Minh saved the world.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   That's the one.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.120]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.120]   I love that story.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.120]   And the world is ending.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   Yeah, it's so good.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.120]   It's awesome.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.120]   I know I'd love to read it.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   Yes, yes.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   The O.I.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   I'm auditioning to read Audible Books.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.120]   They end up everyone at theendofeveryone.com/twitto.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.120]   They sent me an email saying, "We have a book for you to read.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.120]   It's 13 hours."
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.120]   And I said, "Well, how long will that take?
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.120]   And where do I have to go?"
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   And they said...
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   What does someone get paid for something like that?
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.120]   That was the question.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.120]   Is it per word?
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   Kind of thing?
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.120]   It can't be.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   I don't think it's very much.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   You can't make a lot of money doing that.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   Do you think?
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.120]   Scale.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.120]   Scale.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   What is scale?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.120]   Book reading.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.120]   No, I think it's just scale.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   You probably do $800 a day.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   So a full day, eight hours.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   So you probably do a couple grand for reading it.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   It's just scale, I think.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   I have found the longest audiobook on Audible Books.com.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   Thanks to Etchoo, we weren't even close.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   Romans, the greatest letter ever written, complete set by John Piper, 153 hours and 33 minutes.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.120]   Wow.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   How many ratings does that have?
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   It's not ready yet because it literally came out eight days ago.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.120]   And the first person is still listening to it.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:39.920]   Well, this is, I don't understand how this guy could write a 153 hour book on Paul's Letter
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.000]   to the Romans.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   The letter itself is what?
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.120]   A hundred words?
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.120]   Unbelievable.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   Wow.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   Must have been pissed off.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.480]   I got to listen to a little bit of this.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.120]   I'm saying, yeah, I got to listen to that now.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   It's one could possibly be in this book that it's 153.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:42:00.120]   And this book is the place where the gospel of Christ shows what it is.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.120]   Oh, it's a sermon.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   It's a 153 minutes hour sermon.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   That's a little tough to listen to someone who's talking like this.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.120]   Talking like this.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.120]   For the rest of your life.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   Yes.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   Story number two.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.720]   Did we even cover one story yet?
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.120]   I don't think so.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:24.120]   USA Today says we're calling it quits, firing 130 people.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   We're going to go digital.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   I don't know when they're going to kill the print edition, but it sounds like they are.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.120]   Oxford dictionary print edition.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.560]   Gone.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.120]   This is the beginning of the end for newspapers.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.840]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.240]   You work for the newspapers.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.960]   Let me ask Dwight, because he's an inksdane wretch.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.440]   This is what you have beyond Leo is what you have.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.840]   Stories like this.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.680]   I called Dwight when the news for my employer doesn't listen.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.280]   No, the Houston Chronicle will live forever.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.280]   In some form, I think so.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.720]   Some of the story here is not that USA Today is failing because it's print.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.280]   It's because the print edition of the Wall Street Journal became the nation's newspaper.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.280]   Right.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.280]   It's a matter of competition.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.400]   I think print will always be around in some form.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   What's on it is going to be different just like the way AM radio changed.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.560]   When FM came along, I think there will always be print.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:28.000]   It is a good technology in and of itself, and there are times when it works better than
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   others.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.800]   But I think that the future of news and the future of local news is indeed digital.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:39.560]   I don't want to say necessarily the web because I kind of agreed with the with the wired piece
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.720]   that the web is.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:47.080]   The web isn't really being deprecated and apps like you guys were talking about earlier,
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.320]   I think are going to be the future.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:56.440]   I think people will get their information in very precise ways through precise applications.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.000]   I think that's what every media company should do.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.760]   Unfortunately, the Houston Chronicle does not yet have an app.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   We are working on one through Hearst, but I think that is indeed the future.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.680]   The web is being deprecated for sure as well as print.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.120]   I guess it's kind of a real world example of USA Today.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.360]   Jonathan Schwartz was really nice.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.440]   He wrote an article about the big app show.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.320]   I could track most of it.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:34.640]   It went online first and within a couple hours, I had 15, 20,000 downloads of the app.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.440]   The next day comes out in print.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.120]   It's nothing like crickets.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   No one cares.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   There is.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.520]   It's been hard for a long time.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:47.200]   My friend runs active words and he had an article about five years, six years ago now.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.320]   He got 40 downloads from the article.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.280]   There is very little transfer from print over to the grid.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:45:00.440]   We run in the Chronicle a reference, a refer to something that's online.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.160]   It drives very little traffic from what we can tell.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:08.080]   However, I think that's a matter of the audiences being very different.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.280]   People are not going to go look at something, put their newspaper, their printed edition
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.880]   down and then go to the web and tap on it.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:21.080]   I think that when you have these two different audiences, each one of them cares passionately
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.920]   about it.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:30.400]   What's funny is digital people who are really into using the web and apps to get their news.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.720]   When their name appears in the newspaper, they go crazy.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.360]   We have a story that runs in the newspaper with somebody in Houston who's involved in
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.680]   the digital community here.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.120]   They go nuts because their name appears in print.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.120]   They're so excited.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   It's a power.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:55.040]   It's still fun to have a newspaper with your name in it and keep that for your family.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.200]   It's kind of old-fashioned.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.280]   The real problem is, of course, the conversation is not-
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.280]   But it's a permanent.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.280]   There's something permanent.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.280]   I have a lot of newspapers.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.640]   In fact, when I was in the Economist, I have it framed up here.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.160]   There's something permanent about it where things on your flip board are just they go
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.160]   away.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   Screen capture.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.600]   It's not the same, man.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.720]   Kevin's in the digital millennial.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.560]   I just feel like papers are so... I mean, it feels like the news has already stale by
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.200]   the time you read it.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   It is.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   Tomorrow is stale.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.800]   That's if you live on the web and then you go to look for the newspaper.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.560]   But there are people who don't pay that much attention to the web.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.280]   You guys are kind of in a bubble with their...
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   The thing, no, Dwight, they're dying.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.480]   I don't know if we're the bubble right now.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   They're dying.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   But it's the same problem.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.800]   I never use a computer.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   He's dead.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   You know, but my son...
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.280]   I don't think that killed him.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.680]   I don't want to be clear about that.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.640]   He reads the things on the iPad.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:01.200]   If you walk up to a woman in the Walmart in Paraland, Texas, and she's got a baby on
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.040]   her hip and she's trying to pick out the cheapest disposable diapers to buy, and you
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.440]   ask her if she's tried flip board, she's going to think you're nuts.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   Right.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.840]   The majority of the people who are out there right now.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.840]   But Dwight, they had the unwashed over time.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.320]   That used to be true when you asked them about Facebook.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.080]   Now everybody knows what Facebook is.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.080]   So...
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.080]   Right.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.080]   It is changing.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   Most people in the United States now.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:31.520]   You can't think that the cutting edge digital world is what everybody experiences because that's
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.520]   not true.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.440]   Yeah, but do you think that'll be the case 20 years from now?
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.440]   No.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   Yes.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   Really?
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   Yes.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.440]   I'm trying this on for size.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   I'll go to a dollar.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.440]   I agree with you.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.440]   We got a bank account.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.240]   My sons can pay you off if it's not true.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:51.480]   Robert, you're being ageist and I don't like it, frankly, because yeah, seriously, there's
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.440]   a lot of people who aren't as hip and technology adept as we are.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.440]   It's not age.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.440]   It's IQ.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.440]   There's plenty of young people who don't use the internet.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.440]   It's not age.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.440]   It's education.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.440]   It's IQ.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.440]   It's...
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.120]   Let's face it, socioeconomic status.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.200]   If the news organizations would report some actual news, then they might get people buying
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   their papers.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.720]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.000]   I misunderstood the comment that you made.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.120]   What I agree that in 20 years, the woman in Walmart is going to understand that.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.120]   Yes.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   I agree with that very much.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   Yes.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   Just as they understand Facebook today.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   Right.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.120]   Right.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.280]   And, well, no, no, no, look, he's pulled out something.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   What is that?
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.280]   That's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.720]   It's a printing plate from one of the Wall Street Journal's.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:33.720]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.720]   Now, that's memorabilia.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   It's memorabilia.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.720]   It's a little object.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.920]   That's why it's sort of cool to be in a newspaper because you can actually hold it.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:48.840]   And you can say, someday, "Kitch, in the old days we got news on these things."
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   But this is actually a printing plate.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:58.760]   They used to press that against a tree that was smooshed and they'd use some black stuff
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.880]   and it would leave an impression on them would.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.880]   And then we'd...
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.000]   The truck would bring it to our homes.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.520]   And now do that for vinyl records, Leo.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.400]   The reason why it's not a way and going away pretty quickly is it's expensive and it's
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.400]   slow.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   And it's not better.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.400]   And it kills the environment.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.160]   And it's not better in any way, shape or form.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.680]   You know where I've been reading a lot of news actually recently?
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   This guy right here.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.680]   Oh, he likes his new Kindle.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.680]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   I haven't seen this yet.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.680]   It's smaller isn't it?
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.680]   Look how tiny that is.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.680]   It's a little smaller.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.920]   But now, the screen's the same size as it was.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.720]   But the bezel is smaller.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   It's more like it.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.360]   It's more like it yourself.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.120]   Clicking the sides by accident.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.120]   Not yet.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.120]   No, I've...
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   I might have to get one of those.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.120]   That's pretty nice.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   139 dollars.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.120]   I know.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.120]   That's the one without 3G.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   But you don't feel like an...
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.120]   No, I got 3G ones.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.120]   That's 189.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.280]   And how much longer is it going to be that it's going to be 139 bucks?
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.520]   I mean, the cost has already come down from around 400, right?
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520]   Exactly.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.720]   In two more years, that thing's going to be 40 bucks.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.760]   Two more years, Amazon will give it to you as long as you buy four books.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   Exactly.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.760]   In fact, Google...
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   John's going to be right away.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.080]   I expect Google's to give away something like that and subsidize it with advertising.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.160]   Adam Curry is now channeling John C. Devorak.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.160]   It's an amazing job.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.320]   Just trying to help me out.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.320]   Yeah, thank you very much.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.240]   No, I think this is an interesting topic, actually.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   This new Kindle.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.400]   You got to see how small it is.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   It's beautiful.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.840]   You know how thin that thing is.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.840]   Yeah, it's just really nice.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.880]   But it should be free.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.880]   How long before, though...
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.080]   Okay, what's the next form factor?
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.080]   Roll up?
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.200]   What's the next thing?
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.600]   I'm happy with this for a while.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.840]   I don't need anything that rolls up.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.240]   Is it tough enough you could slide it in your back pocket?
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.400]   You could fit.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   You wouldn't want to sit on it.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.120]   Yeah, I don't think you'd want to sit on this.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.120]   Barely fit.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   It needs to be a little tougher.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   I don't know.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   It feels pretty good.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:48.640]   Yeah, I have to say, what's interesting, all you have to do is change something from
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.320]   beige to black and it's better.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   It's that much cooler.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   It's the Johnny I principle.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   You can act still by a beige.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.320]   Johnny I is.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.320]   Who's...
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.280]   Change it from beige to black and look!
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   It's a home device!
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.280]   I love buy books.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   You read books?
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.840]   For me, I love setting the background color, Decepia.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.840]   I'm off to the races.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.840]   It's great.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.880]   So you do read, but you just don't buy physical books?
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.080]   Oh, I buy lots of physical books.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.680]   I love physical books.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.480]   So it's really just not that handy.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.040]   Do you read any iPad or...
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   Do you read any iPad or...
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.040]   I've heard about a book and it was boom.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.040]   I had it within seconds.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.360]   Fortune's Fool's about the music industry and his demise.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.360]   Great book.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.360]   Just downloaded immediately.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   It's brand new.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.360]   I mean, didn't have to go anywhere.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.800]   Do you read on the iPad or on the Kindle?
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.640]   Well, I read it on my iPhone and iPad both because that syncs back and forth, right?
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.600]   I got to tell you, the reason I got the Kindle, well, it was super cheap.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.720]   I mean, a hundred bucks is not crazy.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:48.560]   The other reason though is I'm sitting there on the iPad and all of a sudden you'll remember
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.400]   that you have angry birds behind the scenes.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.400]   No, it'll be sitting there.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.920]   I'll just jump out and start playing angry birds.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.480]   You're such an angry birds fan.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.480]   It's the best game ever.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.480]   Would you please explain because I don't, to me, I don't play...
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.960]   I played it many times.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.960]   I played it many times.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.960]   I said there was a movie and a TV show.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:07.760]   You're doing an angry birds movie with the hell's that show?
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   What's that?
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   What's that you got there, Robert?
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.200]   Since we were talking about books, I bought this last night.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.240]   It's completely hilarious.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:20.760]   It's a book by Lane Smith and it just makes fun of all of us digital types.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.320]   So let me just page through it.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.160]   And it says...
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.920]   Here, let me move my mic.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.200]   This is a book that makes fun of digital people.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.200]   That's a book.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   And let me just read it to you.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.640]   It's a kids book.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.760]   It says, "What do you have there?"
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.560]   It's a book.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   And...
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.240]   Is this for Milan?
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.760]   How do you scroll down?
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   Is this for Milan?
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   I turn the page.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   It's a book.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   I turn the page.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.760]   Keep on with it.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   No, it's the book.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.760]   This is where you read your kids tonight.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.960]   Where's your mouse?
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   It's a book!
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.960]   It's a book.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   Let's talk about Dig 4.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.920]   We'll talk about Dig 4.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   First, we're going to read this children's book.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.360]   I like my nighttime story with Scoble actually.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.080]   It's time for a good time.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.080]   My time's gonna tweet!
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.880]   I try to chat with my tribe.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.880]   Bedtime with Robert.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:11.880]   Bedtime with Scoble.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.160]   Everybody loves bedtime with Scoble.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.280]   Meanwhile, back at Angry Birds.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.320]   I'm on my podcast for the Scoble.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.320]   So, okay, here's Angry Birds.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.280]   By the way, it just came out for WebOS.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.520]   So you can put it on your Palm pre.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.280]   And it's out for Android.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.920]   I'm barely played it.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.120]   You haven't locked any of the special levels.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120]   Well, okay.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   Okay, let me see.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   Where am I right now?
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.120]   Poached eggs.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   I guess I'm on poached eggs.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.040]   So that's like the baby level, right?
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.040]   I can't get this one.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.040]   Help me.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.680]   So, I mean, you look on YouTube and YouTube will have the...
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   So you shoot the bird.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.880]   And tap again to expand.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.880]   Tap.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   Oh, dude, redo it.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   What do you mean?
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   Hit the pause button up or left.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   What do you mean?
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   When it's flying, go re-start.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.880]   The little re-start.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.880]   There you go.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.880]   She didn't tell me this.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.880]   Okay, sling back.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.880]   And then you double tap after fire.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.880]   No, just like a one tap.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.880]   One tap.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.880]   One tap.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:00.880]   The screen.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.880]   It has different...
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.880]   Yeah, now what's up?
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.520]   So you get three birds if you tap the screen.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.520]   Oh, now one.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.520]   So every bird does something different.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.520]   Oh, I didn't even know that.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.520]   They have less power.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   They have less mass.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   So, there you go.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   Perfect.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.520]   Oh, I'm getting good.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.520]   How do you knock that?
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.520]   See, now I got a congestion.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.800]   So those birds, the bluebirds are really good at glass.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.760]   So you want to aim at the glass.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.760]   Okay, like right there.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   Okay, let's see.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   You kind of screwed up.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   I kind of screwed it up.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   It's too late.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:32.920]   It's cool game.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.720]   It's the cool thing about the next one.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.480]   I was the next one executive at one of the major games.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.480]   I was too low.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.640]   He was playing Angry Birds.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.360]   See, how do you get that guy?
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.560]   Oh, I got him.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.560]   But now this one's protected.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.560]   Nothing I can do.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.560]   That's the king right there.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.560]   That's over.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.960]   Yeah, I have to start over.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.880]   This is what I've been playing this stupid level for four weeks.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.720]   Of course, now that I know the double tap, maybe I'll get better at it.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.120]   Four freaking weeks.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.960]   I'm going back to my farm.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.360]   You guys are boring.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.520]   I got by farm.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.520]   You had a farm?
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.520]   What happened to your farm, Kevin?
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.040]   I get tired of those farm games.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   That's a while.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   This is enough.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.600]   Ho-ho-in and I'm tired of ho-in.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.600]   Kevin's tired of ho-in.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.600]   You heard it here first.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.600]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.760]   It's pronunciation error.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.760]   So dig four.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.280]   You were even taking a little...
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.760]   You know, we've talked about dig four before you debuted it here.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   And I was really thrilled.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.680]   Well, it wasn't really my idea.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:33.200]   But I like the change, the idea being that, of course, you can continue to follow everybody.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:38.760]   But if you want, you can also follow people that you know as in Twitter and constrain
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.840]   your news that way.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.840]   Right.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:45.080]   So just to give everyone a little background on that feature, we've had that feature forever
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   for the last three years.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   You have?
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   Oh, I didn't even know it.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   It was just tucked away.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   Like there was a friend and you could go and follow someone.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   We didn't call it following.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.040]   We called it, to add them as a friend.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.480]   And then you would get their digs and see all their comments and everything.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.080]   It was like a hidden feature.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.080]   Right.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:04.280]   So the main reason we made my news, the new default, is that upcoming, like the upcoming
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:08.480]   section where people would actually dig stories to get them on the homepage was used by a
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.880]   very, very small amount of people.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.680]   And they were gaming at weren't they?
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.320]   Well, there was a lot of spam in there.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.360]   There was just a bunch of crap that was going on there that, you know, we looked at that
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.800]   and we said, okay, we have, you know, it was less than 1% of the audience was actually
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   going into upcoming.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.240]   It was less than a half a percent, actually, that were going in there.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.160]   And so, you know, how can we get, you know, when you dig a story, how can we push that
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.040]   out to your friends and the people that you know so that we can help spread the message?
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.320]   Because I was digging great content, but no one would see it.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   Right.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.320]   I want to follow Kevin Rose.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.320]   I want to follow Robert Scoble.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.320]   Right.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.320]   That's who I want to see.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.080]   So basically what we tried to do is make that the new default view.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.000]   And so what we did is we created a directory of users and this directory, some of the people
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.720]   out on the internet have said like, it's clear the publishers are paying you for this.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.280]   And we've never taken a single dollar from any publisher.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   I'm in that directory.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.160]   You didn't pay me for that.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.160]   You didn't pay us for that.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.880]   So basically what we tried to do is like, okay, what is the most popular content on
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   Dig?
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:10.080]   We reached out to some publishers, to some wacky sites like, you know, The Oatmeal,
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:15.320]   The Onion, Scobolizer, Leo, Adam, I'll add you the list if you want to be.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:20.520]   But essentially what we're trying to do is create a directory of interesting people and
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.080]   tastemakers that you might want to follow to find good content, right?
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.040]   So Leo, there's news breaking on Dig right now.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:31.200]   I just dug in article that says Google is in talks with major studios to rent movies
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   via YouTube.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.800]   And so if you're following me, I dug that.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.720]   So you'll see that on your Dig screen.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.720]   Cool.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.040]   So that would be on your right at the top of your news when you log into Dig if you're
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.680]   following a Scobolizer.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.240]   So but here's the issue though.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.600]   There's a couple of problems.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.760]   We've had a lot of feedback that's come in.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.880]   And so what we're trying to do is basically spend the next week and look at the stats,
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:56.360]   look at the usage, look at the feedback and figure out which things we need to fix.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.360]   Because every time we do a release, there's always something that we have to fix.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.480]   The promotion algorithm is clearly broken.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.840]   It's not looking at enough diversity rules that we've had in the past.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:04.840]   So we're trying to fix that.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.240]   Is that one of the things people complain about?
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.240]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:13.800]   I mean, we had a day where we had probably 10 or 15 stories from Mashable on there.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.520]   And so Mashable went out and said to their audience, like everyone, sign up for our, you
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.800]   know, sign up for our new Dig account, follow us, dig our stories.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.240]   And the audience did that.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:27.200]   And we used to have this little piece of the algorithm that would go out and make sure
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.960]   that there was enough digging diversity in a story before we promoted it.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.360]   That didn't, that is no longer working on the new Dig.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.920]   And so we promoted a bunch of Mashable stories, like a bunch in a row, which we've never done
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   before.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.400]   So that's coming back.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.080]   We're going to fix that.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.600]   The other stuff is we want to bring back upcoming because if there's some people that really
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.120]   are passionate about, they care about it, like sure, we can add that back.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.360]   That's no problem.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:52.160]   But the big one is really we want to make sure that that directory of users that we're presenting
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:58.200]   to you is not just a list that we pick at dig, not just something that, you know, a handful
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:02.000]   of people sit around a table and say who should be first, who should be second, but really
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.360]   that it's powered by the users.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:07.560]   So what you'll see in the future is that everyone will be in the directory.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.240]   Every single user of dig will be listed in the directory.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.440]   And you'll be ranked based on how good of a digger you are.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.600]   So how good you are at finding cool content.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:18.320]   So when you go to the tech section, if you are one of the best tech diggers, meaning your
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.800]   content's always being dug by a bunch of other people that are in the tech, you'll
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   be being ranked high.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.240]   So that means that, you know, that's not going to be a major corporation or organization.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.200]   It's going to be an individual that's really passionate.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.200]   Because people voted on it.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.200]   Exactly.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.240]   If it isn't gadget, it's in gadget because they have good stories, right?
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.440]   Or if it's you, it's you.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.360]   It's basically, but it's going to be fair and open to everyone.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:41.680]   And I think, you know, honestly looking into feedback, that's a big issue that I absolutely
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.680]   think that we screwed up on.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.120]   Like we should have had it that way from day one.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.160]   But you know, it's going to take the first thing we have to do is stabilize the site
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.760]   because we've been getting a lot of broken wagons for a while now.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:54.160]   And I'm like, instead of the fail wheel, you have a wagon of axles plus to the broken
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.160]   wagon.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.160]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   Can I ask a question?
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.200]   Yeah, I've never really used dig.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.120]   I did sign up for the dig for beta a couple of weeks ago when you were on the show and
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.200]   you've talked about dig a lot.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.480]   And I have no dog in the hunt, but this being this week in tech, I'd like to ask you the
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.240]   question, which I think is the elephant in the room, which is a really tough one.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.000]   And just take it as a journalistic question.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.680]   And I would say that the some of the vibe that's out there and I may be wrong.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:26.440]   That's what I'm feeling and hearing is Twitter came in and ate digs lunch.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.480]   How would you respond to that?
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:35.200]   I think that dig is is a very different use case, not very different, but it's slightly
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   different.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.920]   Like when you go to Twitter, I'll give you an example.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.960]   Like we have Tony Hawk is one of our suggested users on the dig profiles and also he's a suggested
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.520]   Twitter user.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.520]   If you go out and you follow him on both services, you're going to get his links and
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.320]   everything he's talking about, maybe he's dropping his kids off of the park or whatever
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.200]   it may be on Twitter.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.760]   On dig, it's all about the links.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.480]   It's only the curated content that you're finding on the web that you're bringing that
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.560]   you're digging that you're spreading with your audience.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.080]   So there's a room for everyone to play nicely together.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:09.840]   You have Facebook, which is a combination of things that your friends are liking, profile
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.240]   pictures of change with your friends, new relationship status, things like this, which
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.960]   is put into an algorithm they spit out a page they think you'll like.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.000]   You don't get everything, you get a mixture of certain things.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   Twitter is everything.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.400]   It's the raw feed, in the same way that dig is a raw feed.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.360]   You get everything as it's being dug presented in your mind use.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.920]   But with dig, we said, "Okay, we've always been about the links.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.480]   That's one thing that we're good at is servicing cool content.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.000]   Why not just we want to cut out all the other crap and just make it just about that raw
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.040]   feed?"
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.080]   I don't think that, of course, yes, Twitter has taken some of our traffic.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   There's no doubt about it.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.480]   Twitter and Facebook.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.680]   I don't think that it's not like it's one of those things where I believe that Twitter
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.560]   is the death of dig.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:02:00.840]   We still are a very profitable, healthy business just sitting there doing what we do best.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.960]   Unless they get into the link aggregation game where they create a zeitgeist of information,
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.080]   where you look at a page and you say, "Okay, aside from trending topics, here is the best
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.520]   stuff on tea or whatever it may be," any type of vertical.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.960]   That's where we're taking things going forward.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.800]   Actually, let me explain that a little bit better.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.040]   The way you look at Dig Today, you think, diggers have always thought, "Okay, it's all
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.320]   about that front page of news."
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.080]   When you go there, it's like the zeitgeist of what's happened in the last 24 hours.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.680]   Where we plan to take it is that we want to create this director where you can come in
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   and say, "These are my interests."
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.240]   You can come and say, "I'm into rock climbing.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.240]   I'm into tea.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.760]   I'm into whatever it may be."
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.640]   When you do that, we want to start monitoring how good you are at digging and finding quality
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.800]   content in those verticals.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.960]   We want to build verticals of content based on your interests, based on your digs, and
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.880]   then create a leaderboard and create tastemakers in those verticals.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880]   Great examples.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.800]   I created a Twitter directory called We Follow.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.880]   A little over, right around a million people vat of themselves, Twitter directory.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.880]   I think a great solution.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.640]   They've tagged themselves all these different terms.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:07.520]   Right now, in the We Follow directory, there's 900 people that have tagged themselves under
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.560]   the word knitting, like knitters that are really passionate about knitting.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.560]   They care deeply.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.600]   They care deeply about it.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.760]   What we're trying to do at Dig is, "Okay, let's follow that same model.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   How can we build out verticals where we can get these super, uber passionate people about
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:31.480]   a given topic into these verticals to participate, to gain, rank, and have reputation in these
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   areas?"
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.920]   Then the best of the best will make it to the front page.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.280]   That's the front page, the top new section of Dig.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.360]   If you wonder, a lot of users say, "Why have you created this My News?"
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.520]   We want this My News experience to be a really personalized version of Dig.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.720]   It's not just about big media.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.600]   It's about following tastemakers.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.800]   It will be about defining your interests.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:55.320]   And then eventually, hopefully, creating a really cool customized news page that you'll
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.160]   want to consume daily.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.760]   What's left to be in there under apps?
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.320]   Leo, you got the Chroma Key.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.320]   I got the Chroma Key.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320]   You're now in Dig.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   You want to be in Dig?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.320]   You're in Dig, baby.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.760]   Well, congratulations, Kevin, on one thing.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.040]   For sure, if you're a profitable business and making money, I think that's the thing that
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.400]   Twitter has not actually been able to do successfully or seemingly have not.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.000]   They haven't come out with a real business model.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   That's on ads primarily.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   Adam, I disagree.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Twitter selling news feeds to Google and Microsoft for tens of millions of dollars.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.160]   They're making some money now.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.080]   They're not monetizing with ads particularly well.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.080]   They have ads.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.080]   They're integrating with it.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.120]   I'm sure there's lots of licensing fees.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.200]   They're tonight, is it the Emmys, I think, are doing something with Twitter?
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.120]   I'm sure they're making money that way.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   Sure.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.880]   They got the cash aid, don't they?
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.680]   That's one of the problems with tech press is that the coverage in the tech press is all
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.680]   about name and very little about viability, users, anything.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.120]   It's about ladies, I got it.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.760]   If market share mattered, we'd all be using Nokia phones.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.760]   Yeah, good point.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.720]   Good point.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.160]   Let's talk a little bit about the Emmys.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.120]   They're coming up tonight in just a second and about their social media strategy.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.960]   Are they just hopping on the bandwagon?
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.880]   Or is this something real that's happening?
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.400]   But first, let's talk a little bit about it.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.640]   I'm looking for a new car.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640]   Are you?
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.880]   Do you happen to be looking for a new car?
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.680]   Because I got something for you.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.360]   Let me just tell you a little bit about my friends.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.480]   I can't afford a really expensive one.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480]   You want a Fiesta.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.120]   That's what I could just see.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.320]   Hey, that would look good on me.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.600]   We could just see you driving a Fiesta.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600]   Adam Curry.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   I got to find a little.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.360]   I really don't care how to smart car an Amsterdam.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360]   I loved it to death.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:39.880]   Well, this is 40 miles to the gallon on a gas engine is pretty darn good.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.040]   That's what the Fiesta is getting highway.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.600]   It's got an EcoBoost engine.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.400]   These are the new engines Ford's putting in.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   How does that work?
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.400]   The EcoBoost.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   What does that do?
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.800]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.120]   This might be the car for you as the Taurus SHO.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.440]   It's got a V6 EcoBoost with 365 horsepower.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.440]   That's about the V8.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:02.200]   Yeah, it's V8 horsepower, but it's very fuel efficient.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.200]   The Ford Fiesta, same idea.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.720]   Fuel efficiency number one, but performance is right in there.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.720]   We had a great time.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:14.200]   We had a great time to a Dearborn, Michigan to see the incredible Rouge plant and watch
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.880]   them build these Ford cars and trucks.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.680]   They've been doing it since the turn of the century going back.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.600]   And I recommend if you're going to buy a car, buy an American car.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.600]   Really?
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.800]   I really am very proud of American car.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   Really?
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.800]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.800]   Totally.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:30.800]   We need to build something.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   I like hearing that.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.800]   I'm serious.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.240]   Does this come with that sync stuff with all the high tech fan?
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.720]   Have you ever used sync?
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:37.720]   Boy, that is nice.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.880]   I'm sure you talk about it.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   I love it.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.880]   You've got to get it.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:46.560]   Well, look, if you go test drive a Ford show or the Fiesta, yes, the sync is in there
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.200]   and you'll see the hands-free calling in the 911.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.800]   Did you really get a Mustang?
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800]   Look, it's right out there.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   I see it is.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800]   Oh, wow.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   Nice.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   Isn't that nice?
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800]   Oh, it's sweet.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.960]   You know, the story about the guy rolled up in a Fiesta, the new Fiesta at the gas station?
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:00.960]   No.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.320]   And he was showing off the sync and all that stuff because he had the option in there.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.720]   It was a full service, so the attendant is like, wow, and he's showing all this stuff.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:15.120]   And the guy reaches in his pocket to pay and he pulls out some change and he has a golf
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   tee.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   And the guy says, what's that?
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   He says, oh, that's to put my balls on when I drive.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.720]   And the guy says, wow, these Ford guys, they think of everything.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.120]   I can just tell that was coming.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120]   Ford Fiesta.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120]   We're all weak, everybody.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   Thank you very much.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   Look at those.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.360]   Please start an MSRP if you go to the Ford Fiesta website is very, even you could afford
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.760]   this one, Adam.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.760]   This one right here.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.760]   Right there.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.760]   I'm just out of month.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760]   That's, I don't know.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.880]   It's 13, 320, according to Ford, 227 a month and with a 40 miles per gallon.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.320]   If I have no credit history, I don't know about that.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.320]   I'm not doing an ad for a dealer here, dude.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.440]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:58.520]   Go to Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealers, take a look at the Ford Fiesta, an incredible car
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.000]   with 40 miles per gallon EPA estimate.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.240]   There is no more fuel efficient compact car and there's so much more to make the Fiesta
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.720]   really great, including that amazing Ford sink.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.640]   Give it a try and thank you to Ford for bringing us out to Dearborn.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.680]   They have that plant.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.720]   They have a green roof.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.160]   It's got sedum on the roof.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.240]   Sedum's like a succulent.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.200]   And, and, and I mean, it's so cool.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.360]   It keeps the facility cooler.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:27.160]   You go inside and it's nice and cool in there, but it's very light and airy.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.560]   Really meet what they've done.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.800]   Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles drive one this week at a Ford dealer near you, the Fiesta.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.960]   Buy American, everybody.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.440]   I'm, I'm with you, actually, Adam.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.880]   It sounds like a little jingoistic, but you're right.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.880]   We got to build something.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.800]   Got me all we build is stuff that kills people.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.960]   So let's build something that drives people around.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.080]   You know, it's, I'm, we need manufacturing in this country.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.840]   That's the true way to, uh, to get something going again.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.840]   You know, we need it.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.840]   That was one of the neat things about going to Dearborn is to see how, what was the state
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.080]   of the art 20th century technology is making its way into the 21st century.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.040]   And they're really doing some neat stuff.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.440]   It's kind of mind-boggling.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:10.640]   Uh, Ben Ha, you must know Ben, the icon has Cheeseburger guy.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.040]   He tweeted that he wanted to buy Reddit.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.960]   You probably, you probably, and Reddit responded.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.960]   I love the idea.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.560]   Ben Ha runs a Cheeseburger network and he said, Condi Nast, I'm publicly offering to
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.560]   buy Reddit.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.240]   The best communities I've seen on the internet.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.160]   I also believe Reddit would benefit from more resources and less corporate interference.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.520]   We can offer all of the above.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:38.000]   Is this just a publicity, uh, Ben's good at this publicity ploy or did he really seriously?
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.440]   I don't know how much they would sell it for.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.720]   The Reddit guy responded and said, you can't, you can't, I don't think it's for sale.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.680]   Why is, what is Condi Nast doing with something like Reddit?
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.680]   I don't know.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.720]   I mean, they bought it here a couple of years ago and essentially it's, it's unchanged.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.560]   They haven't really, I don't think they've given them any funding.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.240]   I know the Reddit guys came over to the dig offices here a couple of weeks ago.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.440]   I was out and I missed them, but there's only like four or five guys working on the
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   project.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440]   It's a relatively small team.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.680]   So it's too bad.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.200]   I think that Reddit's an awesome site and they could, they could use some additional help.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.200]   So I wish it kind of.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.440]   You don't, you don't harbor any hostility against them for kind of copying dig.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.640]   No, I, I think that, you know, uh, it's, it's a unique community.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.920]   It's a great community.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   They have different content on there.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.760]   There's room for, you know, people were comparing us to delicious when we first got started
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.720]   to, uh, gosh, there's been a whole series of different clones and other sites out there.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.440]   So it's really where at the end of the day you, you, you really what type of community
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.840]   you like and want to participate in.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.520]   So, uh, I don't know.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.640]   I don't, I don't feel like they're, they're really good guys.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.040]   What I feel like is that there should be some interoperativity ultimately between everybody.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.920]   And there should be this kind of flow of information.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.800]   I don't like silos.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.040]   That makes me nervous.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.280]   Do you believe that standards are ultimately a good thing for dig or does it take business
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.280]   away from you?
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.760]   I don't know that we've ever been opposed to any type of standard.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.240]   There hasn't been really one proposed and kind of a social news.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.440]   There isn't anything in that space.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.240]   No, if there was a look at Twitter, they obviously don't want interoperability.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.600]   They want to silo that data.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.760]   That's their, that's their value.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.040]   It's a lot of sites value.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:17.640]   I think that that's one of the reasons why, uh, you know, Facebook would not, uh, embrace
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.240]   open, what was the Google's initiative, uh, open social.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.240]   Open social.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.160]   So I mean, Google kept pushing on Facebook like, Hey, you know, embrace open social and
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.160]   it just didn't happen.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160]   They did their own thing.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.520]   You know, Zuck, is, uh, is he open to the idea of interoperability or would he like to
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.520]   own it all?
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.600]   Uh, that's a good question.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.120]   I, I, you'd have to ask him that.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.800]   I've never personally asked him that question.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   So I don't know.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.800]   He's not going to tell the truth.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   We should have him come on the show.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.120]   If you could help me get Mark Zuckerberg on the show, I'd be nice.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.600]   I joined, rejoin Facebook.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.600]   I should totally, I would have, I'm going to get him.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.600]   I'll reach out to get him on.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.600]   We may be both come out and it'd be really fun.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:52.600]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.600]   I'd be honest.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.600]   I'd be honest.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:12:00.600]   Um, speaking of a farmville and anybody, anybody, you like that segue?
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600]   Good one, Leo.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600]   It's a good one, Leo.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.600]   It's a firm bill.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600]   It put a farm behind me.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600]   It put a farm behind me.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.600]   I'll find one.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   I'll find your farm.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.800]   I'm sure Leo's got a farmer too.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.880]   Uh, how do you know Dwight?
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.880]   Do I look like a farmer to you?
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.600]   Just intuition, you know.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.600]   I can't get into that.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:23.960]   I've tried farmville and I get, you know, a little bit into it and I think I fall asleep.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.080]   Get ready for this.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:30.080]   This is an article that just came out on CNET.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.000]   Virtual farm games absorb real money and real lives.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.040]   CNET, they're talking about farmville, which is of course on the iPhone as well as Facebook.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.120]   They just did an iPhone version.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.400]   63 million active users each spending an average of 15 minutes a day on the game according
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.560]   to Zinga.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.360]   How does that compare to like World of Warcraft?
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.400]   Oh, it's a lot less than World of Warcraft.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.720]   But there are the outliers.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.240]   There's a woman they found, CNET found a woman they call Katie S. She told CNET her daily
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.760]   farmville routine consists of waking up at 10 a.m. and proceeding to play the game until
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.720]   well past midnight.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.320]   Although her sessions can go much longer, she says, "I've been known to stay up all night
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.800]   until at least five or six a.m. if a new feature is out and I'm excited about it."
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:31.960]   She says she spends about $2,000, $100 a month so far on farmville.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.120]   She's reached a way they found her.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.320]   She's at a level 111.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   This is my mom.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.640]   My mom does it too.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.720]   My mom's at like level 75 on the cafe world where they have to cook.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.120]   And I don't like that because I have a friend on Facebook, Dr. Mom, who shall remain nameless,
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.040]   who keeps sending me like, "I just figured out how to make Loco MoCo."
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.800]   And it's like, please.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.240]   My mom has a separate account using my dad's Facebook account so she can go and have a separate
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:01.000]   shop only so she can gift herself things.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.920]   Oh, that's the trick.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.080]   It's ridiculous.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.080]   That's the trick.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.080]   Here, I've put you.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.480]   It literally just shows how empty and vapid people's lives are.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480]   It's really a sad state.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.480]   Hey, it's my mom.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.480]   Sorry, dude.
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:16.960]   What does your mom do?
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.960]   Is she playing any games?
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.960]   She's dead.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.600]   Maybe she wouldn't be if she'd play more farmville.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.880]   N.G. MoCo, we rule.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:30.040]   That's what I play, says that we rule has 3 million register users who have spent 2.2
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.800]   billion minutes harvesting crop-surrecting buildings and sending jobs to fellow players
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:42.840]   the average time spent on we rule 45 minutes per user per day, 3 times the farm bill.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:48.200]   And I mean, there are some people who spent a lot of money on virtual points.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:55.960]   There's now a website created by a guy named Ryan G. Van Cleave called wowdetox.com for
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.720]   people who are World of Warcraft addicts.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.040]   I mean, there are people who cannot stop playing these games.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.560]   Have you spent any money on farmville or anything like that?
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.560]   We rule.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.560]   Come on.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   I spent a little bit.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.600]   I try not to because, you know, it's really if you're patient, you can do everything.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.640]   Don't you have a psychology show on the Twit Network?
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.440]   We always need some help, please.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.080]   I don't know, sir.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.800]   Seriously, I mean, I think that people inherently really were kind of wired and geared towards
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.600]   building things.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:29.120]   And since we, one of these people got and build cars or build something productive.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.440]   I mean, clearly there's energy and people want to spend time doing something.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.400]   I just find it unfortunate that we're building virtual farms.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.520]   Yeah, but if it's making them happy, does it really matter?
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:41.520]   Look at them.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.520]   This is my happy land.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.520]   That's this happy land.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.040]   Look, and look, you can play it.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040]   Just turn around.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.520]   It's right over your left shoulder there.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.120]   Here's my castle.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.120]   Here's my castle.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.640]   Look, I have dragons and witches.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.040]   I mean, this is like a hobby though.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.040]   You got to think of it like that too.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.040]   I mean, some people like gardening.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.600]   Like, what ships in a bottle?
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.240]   Yeah, but my crown gardening would be better than this.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.840]   The thing about gardening is you get through.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.400]   Why would gardening be better than that?
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   You get fruit.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   You get vegetables.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   You can eat.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   You can eat.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   You can eat.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   There's cancer problems.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400]   Well, I don't have sun.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   I don't have sun.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.400]   No, that's true.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   This is very much safer.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400]   Look, I just collected taxes in that little blue building.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.120]   Yeah, this is just something people enjoy this.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.280]   Let them enjoy it.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.480]   Well, it's one thing if you play it 15 minutes a day.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:25.720]   My sister just sent me a text message saying that my mom's at a level 108 on Cafe Road.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.720]   Oh, she's catching up with Katie.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.720]   Yes.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.640]   I guarantee she won't admit it, but I know my mom's spending like half a grand a month
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640]   on this.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   Well, that's what worries me.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.880]   People spending a lot of money on it.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.920]   By the way, Leo, this is a digression, but it looks like your buzz can tweet just came
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   unstuck.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   Uh-oh.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.360]   There's just a slew of old tweets that showed up.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.360]   Yay!
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.360]   Finally.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.200]   I'm going to hear about that.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.200]   Buzz can tweet barf.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.920]   You popped your buzz cherry, Leo.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.600]   Buzz can screw Leo is what buzz can do.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.480]   Well, I love this world because people on Twitter are abusing me and some people are
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:11.640]   sending me links to gaming to Jane McGonigal's YouTube Twitter TED talk.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.560]   You know, she was at food camp, Jane McGonigal.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.560]   Yeah, she was awesome.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   She was very interesting.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.560]   You were in her talk, right?
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.560]   I was.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.560]   I don't.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.880]   Can we reveal what she talked about or is it still secret?
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:23.880]   I don't know.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.120]   I forget what I can talk about.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.120]   What I can say.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.120]   I know.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.120]   I know.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120]   I'm going to say it because I can't.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.040]   My brain doesn't work anymore.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.480]   I'm old and I'm playing too much.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.960]   We rule.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.520]   She said, I don't know if this is true or not, but she said, the future is in secrets.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:46.800]   We've gone so far into this, you know, yeah, there's no privacy, no secrets anymore.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.400]   You and I, Robert, are the poster children for this.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.400]   Absolutely.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.120]   That people, she says psychologically, Jane's interesting.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.880]   She says psychologically, people are stimulated by both the act of keeping a secret and by
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.280]   telling a secret.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:04.920]   And if you tell somebody a secret, it is a bond, there is an endorphins are released,
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:10.000]   and she says the future is in creating, telling, keeping secrets.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   That's true.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.120]   I mean, there are secrets I have.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.200]   I have a lot of companies you've shown me stuff that I talk about.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.200]   Come on, Robert, tell us a secret.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.200]   Come on, Robert.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.200]   I can't talk about it, right?
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.200]   Come on, Robert.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.200]   Tell us about Pat.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.200]   Tell us about Pat Kevin Rose.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.480]   Tell us what is Pat.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   What is Pat?
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:28.480]   I can't talk about it.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.480]   What is Pat?
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.480]   Still knows what is Pat is.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.960]   It's all a big secret.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.160]   It's Dave Moran's new company, and it looks pretty cool, but I can't talk about it because
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160]   you idiot.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160]   Suck.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.080]   I have Dave Moran, formerly a Facebook.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.080]   He's not a Facebook anymore.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.080]   The people have shown it to me.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080]   I want to keep them.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.080]   Oh, you saw it.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.840]   I saw it for a few microseconds.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.840]   No, not for me.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.840]   And not for you.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.840]   Have you seen it?
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.840]   Kevin?
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840]   I have it on my phone right here.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:55.840]   You want to see it?
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.840]   I can see it.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840]   I won't tell anybody.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.160]   You know how good I am at keeping secrets?
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.480]   See now Kevin and I would have a bond.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.480]   Go ahead and just do it.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.040]   And then we'll, and you'll see we'll have a bond.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.040]   It'll be, this is a test of Jane's theory.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.040]   Not not here.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.040]   Not alive.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.680]   Not live.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.800]   You, Kevin is actually very good at keeping secrets.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.400]   I think that's probably necessary.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.520]   Both as an entrepreneur and as somebody at dig, right?
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.000]   But I don't know how you do it because when you're getting drunk at dignity, isn't it
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.640]   kind of hard to not like blab?
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.080]   We don't get as drunk as we used to.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.080]   But yes, it is hard.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.440]   It's hard for me and I'm not even drunk.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.280]   You've had half a beer.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.280]   Half as well.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.280]   You've got a bottle of wine.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.280]   It's good.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.280]   Yeah, but I haven't opened it.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.280]   This is, thank you for bringing this.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280]   This is Sierra Nevada tumbler.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.280]   It's lovely.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.280]   It's quite good.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.680]   It's a lovely vintage from October.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:49.600]   Oh, she's very, oh.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:55.120]   You know, I did, I did drive a Ford Flex into the Ford Fiesta at the Ford test track.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.120]   Awesome.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.360]   They actually, oh, this is scary.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.160]   That's really scary.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.360]   That wasn't my intent.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.360]   There we go.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.160]   Hey, Adam, Adam, Adam.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.800]   That's me.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   Fun with the green screen.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800]   I'm sorry, Adam.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.800]   Let me, let me fix that.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800]   All right.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   All right.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.200]   Hey, I, you froze there.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.200]   Did you?
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.440]   Now you're in your beautiful beach.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.440]   Enjoy the beach.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.440]   Adam, Adam, Adam.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.000]   Yes, I'm enjoying.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.040]   They're relaxing beach.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.040]   Let me go on.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.120]   There must be some more news here before we did.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.280]   How about this Google calling stuff that you could get on?
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.760]   Well, I'm the only one in the country that can't use it, but Google announced this.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.160]   I saved this story for you.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.160]   Thank you, please.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.160]   Thank you.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:48.760]   I'm going to say Google announced that they were going to put free voice calling in Gmail.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:53.120]   This is using a Google chat, Google talk.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:58.120]   You do have to download a plug-in that gives you video and voice.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:03.120]   And all of a sudden, in your chat list is a phone call item and you click it and you
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.880]   can dial any number in the US and Canada for free.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.680]   They say free at least through the end of the year.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.120]   Why does Google do that?
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.800]   Well, this is kind of interesting.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:18.000]   And I, John got really John Devorek who I do no agenda with.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.600]   Got really angry with me today because I said, I got a story, but I'm holding it back.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.680]   I'm keeping it for Twitch.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.000]   Take that.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000]   Take that Devorek.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:33.600]   Yeah, he was like, so in 2006, Peter Norvig, I think his name is.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.400]   He's the director of research at Google.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:45.080]   In 2006, he said Google is working and in fact, I have the whole system here, PDF.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.200]   Google is working on a system that listens to what your TV is playing in the background
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.560]   and then serves you relevant adverts.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:57.320]   He says literally, he literally says these ideas will eventually show up in real Google
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.400]   products sooner rather than later.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:04.600]   And so I'm wondering, is this one of those products where Google, because it's pretty
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.600]   seamless.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.520]   I don't remember installing anything.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:11.760]   And even if I have flash turned off, it still works.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.520]   And it doesn't ask me, you know, like if you go to porn sites and you want to do your webcam,
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.520]   it says you sure you want to share your video.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.120]   I mean, I'm reliably informed about that.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:24.600]   Google had a patent on watching your mouse move.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.600]   Right.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:30.640]   So I'm just wondering, you know, the technology is amazing what they, what goes into it that
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.560]   takes five seconds snippets and it does the, it actually does the analytics on your PC
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.760]   and sends the analytics off to Google, which of course, you know, they'd never listened
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.760]   into your conversation.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.960]   They don't need to any more than they'd read your email.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.400]   They just analyze it, right?
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.400]   Right.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.000]   The analyze and that's actually apparently happening on your, on your computers.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.040]   I'm wondering, do you know that this is, do you know that this is happening with Google
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.340]   voice?
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.480]   I don't know if it's happening, but here's the director of research saying it's going
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.960]   to show up in Google products.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960]   And here we are.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.200]   My microphone is now active.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.200]   So I'm curious.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:05.760]   Well, you know what, you know, I would credit that because after all, again, Google told
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:10.200]   us this when they, they put out, remember that Goog 411 and you would get it was free
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:15.360]   411 service and they later told us, oh, you know what we did?
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   We, we use the Goog 411 to improve our voice recognition.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.760]   And one of the reasons Google's voice recognition and Android is so good is because they learned
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.560]   a lot by getting a lot of voice samples from Goog, what, 411 and corrections from Goog
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.560]   411.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.560]   So it's not using what you're saying.
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.080]   Well, I just pasted, I'll do it again.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.640]   I'll paste this PDF from Google research into the chat room so people can take a look at
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640]   it.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   It's pretty amazing what they did.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:46.280]   And this is from, this is, yeah, I think 2006 when they posted this online.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:51.480]   It's pretty cool technology, but the whole idea is to listen to what television show
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:58.120]   you're watching and then serve up ads on your, I guess, if you're surfing or anywhere you
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.920]   are and in the future, maybe on Google TV.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.360]   All I know is the guy said it's going to show up in real Google products.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.080]   And here's one that might be applicable.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.600]   I have no idea what's, what's happening under the hood.
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:13.600]   So you're saying that, that what they would do is turn the microphone on on your computer
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.240]   now that you've enabled that and have it on, not just when you're in phone calls.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.240]   Possibly.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.240]   All the time.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:21.240]   Possibly.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.240]   Well, it's Google said they would do it.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.240]   So is this it?
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:28.600]   This is my question, change in the, in the, in the, you let the terms of service.
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.600]   Has anybody read the terms of service?
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600]   Easy to install.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.720]   So I mean, even though you failed on the install, Leo, but everyone's like, Oh yeah, cool.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:36.720]   Google.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:37.720]   I just installed that.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:38.720]   I mean, wait a minute.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.720]   I did not fail on the install.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.720]   It never, it never turned out.
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:42.720]   No, they failed me.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:43.720]   They failed you.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.720]   They failed you.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.720]   I agree.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.720]   But offered it.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720]   When you, this is big deal.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.560]   I mean, you're, you're now activating my microphone and potentially camera.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.920]   And I think it's, I'd like some security people to just check in.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.560]   Well, when somebody tell me who has this, because I am the only man in America who doesn't.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.120]   Does it ask permission when you make the call?
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.000]   Does it, does it say I'm going to turn on the microphone?
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.480]   No, no, no.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.480]   You can get it.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.600]   I disabled flash on my safari.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.600]   It's not using flash.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.080]   It doesn't use flash.
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.080]   Sorry?
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   It's not using flash.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.080]   Well, I think it does use flash.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.080]   No, it uses its own plug-in.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.080]   It has a plug-in.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.080]   It has.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.080]   That's why you down.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.080]   I don't have to plug-in.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.080]   Easy to get out of it.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:22.880]   At some point, you probably did a video chat.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.120]   They've had a video chat.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.120]   And you need that plug-in.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120]   Wow.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   It uses that.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.840]   But I don't have, how do I de-install it then?
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.120]   It's an extension.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.320]   And you'll see that you have it.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.960]   No, I don't have an extension for it here.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:34.960]   I looked in safari.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.960]   I'm looking right here.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:41.840]   The only extension I have is the click to flash to disable flash on safari.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:45.640]   I have, there's no other extension in here.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:50.040]   You never added Google voice and video chat to your Google.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040]   Google talk.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.080]   If I did, how can I remove it?
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.720]   I just had to install it for the first time.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.440]   It wasn't working unless I installed it.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.320]   But now that I've installed, it says call phone on here and then it pops up.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.320]   You have to install that.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.320]   And that's why it's not using flash.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.320]   It's using its own.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.920]   But that doesn't make a difference with your argument when we're at the other.
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.560]   It's whether it's using flash, right, or un-install it and there's no way to do it.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.560]   Oh, I'm sure there's a way to do it.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.560]   Okay.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.920]   What are you, what are we scared of here that they might listen?
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.800]   They turn the microphone on.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.800]   When?
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800]   My mic's not on right now.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.800]   How do you know?
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.280]   Well, Google's not going to do that.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.280]   You sure?
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.280]   Oh, no.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.280]   Google would never do it.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.120]   Are you, you really think we're going to turn the mic on?
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.120]   Here's the deal.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.120]   Listen.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.120]   Yes.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.120]   Because they're doing it to you.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.120]   What?
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.120]   Do I have it?
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.120]   They're doing it to your email, right?
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.120]   They scan your email for ad links, right?
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.120]   But they tell you they do that.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.120]   They're telling you to do that.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.240]   But what if they, but what if there's no human, what if there's no human listening?
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.760]   It's just algorithmically looking at words that you speak.
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:55.720]   Leo, Leo, if Google were to do that without disclosing it and it would be discovered,
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.720]   that would be the end of its business.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.720]   Exactly.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.600]   It's not worth the risk for them to do that.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.600]   Right.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.800]   They said they stated they would do it.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.440]   So we should just check.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.440]   There's nothing wrong with checking.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.320]   I'm of good belief, but maybe we should just check it.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.320]   Could someone please check?
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.240]   I don't have an extension to look at.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.240]   I will have, I will have, I will have, I will have some on check.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.120]   You've got this week of security.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.480]   Because Steve Gibson, yeah, security.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.920]   That's the guy.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:22.920]   It's interesting.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.720]   You know, they say they may just, they may just want to be in telephony.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.960]   They may just say, look, we just want to, you know, have people use, look, they attach
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.320]   it to Gmail for a reason.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.160]   Gmail is their biggest product right now after search.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.480]   They more people will see it because of it.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.800]   Same reason they attach budgets, buzz to Gmail, right?
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   No comment.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   Everybody wants to say anything.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.800]   Scoble, do you think this is crazy?
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.600]   No, I'm over privacy anyway.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.400]   So I don't, I really don't care.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.400]   Let you go.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.400]   Once it turned on, you say, land him listening.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.320]   Turn it on, baby.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.600]   That's how cutting edge Robert Scoble is.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.800]   Like he wants his mic turned on.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:04.800]   That's amazing.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.800]   That's social.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:07.800]   It was over.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.800]   It's in library.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.400]   Inter-ip plugins is where I need to look.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   You know what?
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.120]   It's not what just happened to my Twitter feed, but I, none of these are my tweets.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.120]   Attention couch potatoes, walking, boost, spring connectivity.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.680]   That's not me.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:25.080]   Shooter kills five injuries one.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.080]   What is this?
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.080]   What do you listen to?
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.400]   That's from Buzz could tweet though, right?
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.000]   Buzz is putting crap in my feed.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.360]   Oh, it's from Dig.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.360]   It's from Dig.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:38.320]   It's from, it's because you added your Dig account to Google.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:42.160]   We don't push things into, into Google.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.400]   You must have added your Dig account to Google.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.200]   I didn't add my Dig account to Google.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.520]   Google must have added my Dig account to Google.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.920]   Holy come, Molly.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.040]   And it's not stories I'm digging.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.040]   It must be stories you're digging.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.360]   It's not what I would dig.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.960]   Why California won't legalize pot?
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.960]   Probably.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.640]   I would dig 36 die as Ecuadorian bus runs off road over turns.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:10.000]   I would dig thousands rally in Hong Kong to protest Manila hostage deaths.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   This isn't me.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   You're me, you're me, you're me.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.480]   Go agenda.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.680]   Is this from no agenda?
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:15.680]   I have no idea.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:16.680]   I'm just making up.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.480]   I think Google's barfing on me again.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.560]   I think this is coming from Google, Google's barfing on me.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.560]   Yeah, you're right here from Dig.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.560]   I do not have any.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.560]   This is from Dig.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.560]   It says from Dig.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.560]   Move media plugin and double who's web plugin, whatever that is.
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.720]   Okay, well, double debugging Google here.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.040]   Double conspiracy theory.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.000]   Seven connected sites.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.080]   Let me see what I'm connected to.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.080]   I don't think I connected to.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.080]   Yeah, you connected your Dig.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.080]   Oh, there it is.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.080]   I didn't do that.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.080]   It's all through Dig.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.080]   Remove site.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.080]   I think that's a new term though, Leo.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.080]   Google barf.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.080]   I got Google barf.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.240]   So why is Google pulling in your dig link?
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240]   So it doesn't...
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:55.640]   Oh, they're kind of friend feeding it like that, huh?
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.640]   They're trying to be like friend feeding?
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.640]   I just took it out of Google.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.520]   I never put it into Google.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.520]   I'm telling you, Buzz is buggy.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:07.040]   Buzz had a big bug where, you know, if you were one of my followers in Google Buzz and
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.040]   you deleted your Google account, all of a sudden nobody'd see my, my buzz.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.040]   Buzz is...
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.920]   They took them five days to find that one.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.160]   I'm going to quit Google.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.160]   You know what, Leo?
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.160]   They heard you complain.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.160]   They're going to quit the Google.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.160]   They heard you.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.160]   They're not me.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:28.440]   They heard you talk about their secret, super secret plan to wiretap everyone in the world.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.000]   And they said, we've got to get him.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   How do we get him?
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   We get him through the port.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.160]   I think they just heard you and like, oh, we have a problem in sector four.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.120]   It seems like a buzz is not working.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.120]   You've got to switch that on.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.120]   Check that user.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.120]   You're digging.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.600]   You're algorithmically and we'll improve Leo wrong.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.600]   Let's take a break.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:49.600]   I can't.
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.600]   Exhausted.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.440]   It's a long show, man.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:53.440]   Is it over?
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.440]   It's awesome.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:55.440]   It's not over yet.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.440]   I love it.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.440]   I mean, we can keep going.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440]   I'm fine.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.440]   I'm digging it.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.440]   How long is no agenda?
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.440]   It's like two hours.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.440]   Two hours.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.440]   Yeah, we do two hours.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.440]   This is shorter than no agenda.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.440]   I don't think Twitter ever ends, man.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:06.440]   It just keeps going.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.440]   No.
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.440]   No.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.520]   I put up a little thing here like this.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.960]   I put this up and I say cut there.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   That's a show.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960]   That's a show right there.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960]   That's a show.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.960]   That's it.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:18.960]   We're done.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.800]   And then they start another one after I put that up.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.600]   You haven't played a hot pocket sound.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.600]   Now, editors, don't cut that one.
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:25.600]   Okay.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:26.600]   Leave this in editor.
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.600]   Take that off.
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.600]   No, leave that in.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.600]   Now, see, I'm really confusing them.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.600]   Now, leave that one in.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.600]   The editors are going to be limited.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:32.600]   The views doesn't end.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:35.400]   I'm being called arrogant by people all over the world right now on Twitter.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.400]   Why are you arrogant?
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.400]   You haven't said a word.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.400]   No, I don't.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.400]   What is it?
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.160]   They're making fun of me because I hold things up, you know?
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.760]   You haven't said a thing on this show.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.760]   Okay.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.040]   You want to be arrogant in a moment.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:53.080]   Robert Scoble will explain why TechCrunch thinks there are too few women in tech and
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.360]   it's their fault.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.720]   You want to take that one, Robert?
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:57.720]   Sure.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.720]   That's coming up in just a bit.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:01.440]   But first, a quick word from our friends at Citrix.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.720]   They are the folks who do go to assist.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:03.720]   We use this.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.720]   I don't know if you remember this, Kevin.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.480]   We use this on the screen savers from time to time.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.800]   To assist people with their problems on their computer.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.000]   They've come a long way, baby.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.560]   The new go to assist express is faster, easier to use and a great way to fix problems on
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.560]   Max or PCs.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.440]   Dan, you're in Dan Hendricks is in the studio.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.760]   He's our wonderful chat moderator.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.040]   How many years have you been moderating chat for us, Dan?
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.560]   For free, I might add.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.760]   Six and a half years, we have not paid him one penny.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:28.760]   Wow.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.560]   And at this point, we, Dan will not pay him.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   He's free.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.360]   You said a president, Dan.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.960]   Oh, he'll keep doing it for free.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:40.000]   No, we're going to, I think we're going to take care of you because you do a great job
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.280]   in that chat room.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.960]   So Dan's in IT.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:45.840]   And you know, you know, the worst thing is that phone call where you got to walk somebody
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.840]   through something.
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:47.840]   It's so much easier.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:51.440]   In fact, sometimes you're tempted just getting the car and drive over to the site, fly to
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:54.440]   the site, anything but click start.
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.200]   Okay, go to the accessories.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:57.520]   I can't take this anymore.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:00.320]   How about this scenario, Leo?
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:04.040]   I'm sure you have the same that I have and Kevin has it and Robert and Dwight.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:06.000]   I'm sure we all have the same problem.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.360]   When you know something about computers, you can configure stuff.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.640]   You kind of the go to guy for your family, your friends.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.980]   And they're always calling you as like, Hey, you know, my email, and then you're literally
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:19.560]   trying to help the stewardess land the 747 on the phones.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.680]   Like, I do all this.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.120]   And when you, I think the easiest thing, this would be a great Christmas gift, basically.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:29.160]   Give all of your friends and family a go to assist account.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:33.000]   And then it'll save you hours of time a month.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.440]   You know what you could do, Adam Curry?
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:42.280]   You could actually get 30 days free, sign up, and then you would do it and then quit.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.840]   I shouldn't tell.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.080]   So wait until something breaks.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.080]   Yeah, then call them.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.080]   Do it all.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.760]   No, no, no, I think this is this is a very valuable service.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.760]   It's really, really good.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.840]   It's like having a tech right there in your computer.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.720]   They can they can remote control your screen.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.120]   They can really fix problems.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.800]   I think this is the future of great services is people on the other end.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:04.800]   I love it.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.800]   I think it's good.

[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:08.940]   You never did the carpet store or the car dealership.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:09.940]   Bring the kids.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:10.940]   Bring the old lady.

[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:12.940]   Come on down.
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.700]   We got hot dogs and balloons for the kids.
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:20.100]   But MTV in the days of VJs had billboards and we'd have to read the billboards.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.940]   So and they were really cheesy.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:28.140]   And be like, this was it or the top 20 video count on is brought to you by Skittles.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.660]   Yeah, we had to read those.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:33.420]   And I was like, Oh, I got to do the billboards.
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:36.580]   Our phone to Kerr is like, it's part from the Kerr.
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:37.820]   I remember them all.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.820]   It's horrible.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:39.820]   It stays with you.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:41.500]   Wake up in the middle of the night.
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:47.020]   Skittles was it was what is the fresh maker was Mentos there?
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:48.340]   Mentos the fresh maker.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.340]   Yeah, we had that one too is brought to you by Mentos the fresh maker.
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:52.820]   Yeah, you had to say it that way.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.140]   Yeah, yeah, of course you did.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:55.140]   The fresh maker.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.980]   You have like some some weird Euro trash accent.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:00.140]   It wasn't really clear what the fish.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.340]   Yeah, I was good at it.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:02.340]   You were a fish maker.
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.340]   Fish maker.
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.060]   I actually got an extra the third.
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:08.580]   I was there for seven and a half years, but I had a contract for the first two years.
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:13.500]   And then the third year they actually paid me extra to do all the billboards for MTV.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.300]   So I was always there.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.620]   Were you a DJ before you went to MTV?
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:21.060]   Yeah, I still in my first radio station, I built myself.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:25.900]   And my mom drove me around the block to see how far the signal would reach.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.380]   And then I found the kids in the neighborhood were listening to it.
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:31.220]   So then I built a mixer and then I got a microphone.
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:35.540]   And then for years I was practicing trying to get my deep radio voice.
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.220]   And you got to talk like this everybody.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.340]   Cause you know, it's really, really cool.
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:41.140]   We do it in the morning everybody.
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:45.740]   Yeah, we just turned this into a morning zoo.
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:46.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.740]   Let's back up the bell.
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:49.740]   Hey.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:55.860]   Hey, I think we need to do a morning show with you, Adam.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.580]   I'd love to, man.
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:58.940]   I want you going to do that.
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:36:59.940]   You're going to do a morning show.
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:00.940]   I want to do a morning show.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.340]   You want to be part of it?
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:03.340]   Hell yeah.
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:04.340]   Would you do it?
[01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:05.340]   It would be really fun.
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:06.540]   I thought it would be a morning show for geeks.
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:11.060]   You know, so it would still be kind of fun and entertaining.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.060]   The kind of thing you want.
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:17.180]   And what my thought was you write an alarm clock application for all the portable platforms
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:20.220]   so that it, it, that's the alarm is you wake up.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.220]   That's amazing.
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:24.220]   When you unlock it, the Trump, the alarm, it starts the webcast right there.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:25.220]   Right.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:26.220]   And you could take it with you out in the kitchen.
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:28.220]   Totally.
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:30.220]   What make you do it?
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:31.220]   I don't know that.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.220]   I just gave away my entire idea.
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:34.220]   But no, it's good.
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:35.220]   I don't have to worry.
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:36.220]   Nobody else is going to do it.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:37.220]   But let's get to war act on to.
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:38.220]   I can't be without my buddy.
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:40.300]   I want to make sure no one gets the wrong idea here.
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:41.300]   We will.
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.300]   No, no, we love John.
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.300]   No, no, no, no.
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.740]   We, and I've been thinking, uh, there's a, there's a number of people I want to put
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:46.740]   on this thing.
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:51.300]   It'd be really fun, kind of a light, light zoo thing, but with a focus on social media
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:55.740]   tech, bringing the, bringing the evil new world order who are trying to kill us.
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:56.740]   That would be my part.
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:57.740]   You could do that.
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:58.740]   You could be the conspiracy theorist.
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:37:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:01.740]   I like that.
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:03.740]   We should create a character for Adam.
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:06.740]   Like, it's me, the Illuminati guy.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:09.740]   Hey, it's your, ah, it's Illuminati guy, everybody.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.460]   Let me tell you what's going on.
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:15.660]   Well, you know, you know, that's art Bell made a pretty good living doing.
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.660]   Hell yeah.
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:17.660]   Coast to coast.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.660]   That was a good day.
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.660]   Yeah.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:20.660]   It's not George Newering.
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:21.660]   Everyone's in a while.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:22.660]   George will call me.
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:24.380]   I'll do a bit on the show and then this is coming up.
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.780]   He was abducted by aliens and now he's back.
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:27.780]   We're going to talk to you.
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.540]   That doesn't always get me.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:33.740]   So the earthquake machine has been turned on once again and we'll talk about that after
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:34.740]   this break.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.740]   It's so serious.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:37.500]   And you kind of want to, does he believe this?
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.780]   Does he actually believe this or is he?
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.780]   What's going on?
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:43.620]   Well, don't get me started.
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:46.380]   Emmy Awards going digital Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.020]   Are you going to watch him tonight?
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:49.420]   Jimmy Fallon, your buddy Jimmy.
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:50.420]   You like Jimmy.
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:52.420]   You know Jimmy pretty well, right?
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:54.140]   He's always been pretty techy.
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:55.140]   Is that?
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.140]   He's a geek.
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:57.380]   He's definitely a geek without a doubt.
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:01.220]   So they're asking for jokes for Jimmy.
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:02.620]   People are supposed to tweet lines.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:03.620]   I guess it's that bad.
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.620]   That's bad.
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.620]   People write the jokes.
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:08.740]   We can't avoid writers.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.660]   So would you please tweet?
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:13.460]   So crap Leo, did you just tweet a ton of links?
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.500]   I'm telling you that came out of Google at a dig.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.220]   You saw that what you tweeted, right?
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:19.220]   It's garbage.
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:21.380]   It's like you tweeted 30 times in a row.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.860]   Oh, something's going really wrong.
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:23.860]   Look at this.
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:26.340]   Yeah, something's really wrong.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.220]   No, I'm just going to resign from social media.
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:33.180]   So here's the, here's what's, here's what you need to do tonight when you watch the
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.180]   Emmys.
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:40.060]   Um, the get a, get a bottle of vodka and the minute someone says, we've just tallied it
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:43.580]   up a billion people around the world are watching us tonight.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:44.580]   Clap, clap, clap, clap.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.180]   That's when you drink the whole bottle of vodka.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.180]   They always do that.
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:49.100]   And the readings come out the next day.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.140]   It's like 6 million people watch or something.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.660]   Yeah, just shot the whole bottle.
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:53.660]   The whole bottle.
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:55.100]   Adam, it has a whole bottle in one go.
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.260]   So you know what happened?
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:58.460]   I just tweeted the entire dig front page.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:39:59.940]   Thank you.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:00.940]   I did.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:01.940]   I did.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:02.940]   Thanks.
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:03.940]   Thanks.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:04.940]   Not to you.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:05.940]   It's not your fault, Kevin.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.580]   Thanks to Google buzz, which just decided for some reason that I am dig.
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:10.580]   What's the feature?
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.500]   No, you're tweeting this week.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.020]   Twill is what you know, ignore the twill stuff.
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:17.300]   Oh, there we go underneath all dig stuff.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.300]   New mug shot.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:20.660]   I didn't, I didn't tweet Paris Hilton's mug shot.
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:25.540]   This is all, this is all from dig, including the twill stuff.
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:29.180]   The people that aren't watching this show right now, like, wow, look at this chat today.
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:31.060]   This is great interoperability.
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.060]   Silos.
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:33.060]   There's no silos.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.060]   It's perfect.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.060]   The flow goes.
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.060]   Oh, exactly what you were asking for.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.260]   You turned that on some.
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:39.260]   No.
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:40.260]   No.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:41.260]   Okay.
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:42.260]   No.
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:43.260]   Oh, you're dropping followers.
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:47.620]   You were saying I was a two, as this morning I was a two, two four zero zero.
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:48.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.620]   I've lost already a hundred followers.
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:50.620]   Oh, they dropped.
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:51.620]   Oh, two, two, three.
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:53.620]   Man, oh, wait, I'm dropping.
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.020]   Tweet spam is a spammer.
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:57.380]   A hundred people dropped me.
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:01.260]   It's the sound of a thousand voices calling out an agony.
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:04.540]   Maybe you should tweet about six or seven times what it happened.
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:07.060]   Yeah, that'd help.
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.060]   I give up.
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:09.180]   This is what I don't like.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:11.620]   I don't like automated tweets.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:15.500]   I don't like automated tweets that I don't like kind of trying to converge multiple social
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:16.660]   media.
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:21.540]   I think there are silos to a certain extent are good because there are different culture
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.740]   in each one.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:26.820]   And if you try to kind of blend them, there's always some kind of disconnect or context
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:27.820]   problem.
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.740]   No, this is why I'm going to write no, this is why I'm going to write the cynics guide
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:31.980]   to social media.
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:34.340]   Everybody says that, but it's a lie.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:35.340]   Everybody says don't.
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:37.940]   Everybody says don't be in megaphone.
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:41.500]   Facebook is to turn off all of my tweets that are coming into Facebook.
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.020]   I didn't know you could do this, by the way.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:49.100]   If you see a tweet in Facebook, you can click the X on the on the status message in Facebook
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:53.620]   and it'll give you the choice to filter out all tweets or all things of that item.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:58.220]   And you can do that for four square for Farmville if Kevin's playing too much fun.
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:41:59.220]   Oh, that's excellent.
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:01.060]   You can hide everything there.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:05.300]   I already have people on buzz saying stop spamming, Leo.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:10.220]   You can go to the top of your buzz and see which.
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:11.860]   No, I already disconnected it.
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.860]   I disconnected it and it's reconnected or something's going on.
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:16.860]   It's not.
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:17.860]   Yeah, it got reconnected.
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:18.860]   Yeah, it's broken.
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:19.860]   It's broken.
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:20.860]   It's broken.
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:23.100]   It's called the tech guy is what people are saying.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:25.180]   Yeah, that's another funny joke.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.180]   People like to make.
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:28.260]   Oh, Leo will fix it.
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:29.260]   No, I do.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:31.780]   These are the same people we trust to with our microphone.
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:32.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:34.780]   I just I just yeah.
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.900]   All right, I'm bad enough.
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:38.300]   I have enough of all these.
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:39.820]   Kevin Rose, thank you for being here.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.820]   Thank you for bringing beer.
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:41.820]   That's me.
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:44.420]   Thank you for watching the last show I will ever do.
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:46.900]   Officials probe fire at proposed Tennessee Mosk site.
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.220]   I did not tweet that.
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.540]   She's Louise.
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:55.420]   I can consume them for defamation of character.
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:58.180]   Lord, Kevin is at dig.com.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.660]   Dignation is still on.
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:02.140]   Yes, still on still gone strong.
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:07.300]   And you and Alex will be doing the next one win, you know?
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:10.300]   This week, but I've got a bunch of stuff to fix a dig first.
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:12.020]   So I'll get down there though.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.020]   Thank you, by the way.
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:17.220]   I think that people don't understand how responsive and committed Kevin is to listening
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:18.220]   to people.
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:19.220]   You get a lot of heat.
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:20.380]   It must be hard, but you listen.
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:23.980]   Yeah, I mean, we've got honestly there's I would say out of the feedback we've gotten
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:28.900]   at probably 75, 80% of it's really valid stuff that we're going to fix.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:34.180]   And then there's some stuff that certain spammers are trying to hit us with and certain people
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:38.900]   that have an agenda that want certain features.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:42.700]   It's funny, we had this one time where we removed the Barry feature from dig and that
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:43.700]   was a big controversy.
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:44.700]   Yeah, people.
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:49.860]   Well, now wasn't this though the issue was that right wing spammers were burying all
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:52.900]   progressive or left wing articles and the other way around.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:53.900]   And then it got to the war.
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:54.900]   It became a war.
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:56.940]   It became a war and I hate this kind of stuff.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:01.340]   But you know, we looked into it and the bulk of bearing happening was around political
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:02.340]   stories.
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:03.340]   Of course.
[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:06.940]   And it's like the most partisan divisive topics are the ones they're going to get people
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:07.940]   doing.
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:08.940]   Yeah.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:10.260]   And it's just a really nasty mess.
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:14.740]   So we got to figure out how to how we can potentially fix that problem with algorithms,
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:16.260]   but it's going to take a while.
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:21.020]   All I have to say is that honestly we everyone who dig knows the issues that we have just,
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.180]   you know, it's going to take a couple of weeks to get everything ironed out and get
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:25.860]   it stable, get these features out of the back.
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:26.860]   So just give us some time.
[01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:27.860]   We'll get there.
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:30.860]   Yeah, Kevin, I just tried to dig something and it didn't let me dig it.
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:35.780]   So yeah, it's it's another at least a week of of stabilizing the site.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:38.620]   Why is that because I mean you're using the same servers the same.
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:39.620]   We're not.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:40.620]   You're not.
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:41.620]   So it's a brand new back end.
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:42.620]   It's all cuz I'm amazed now.
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:43.860]   So we're out of my sequel.
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:45.020]   Oh, that's a big deal.
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:50.820]   And there's there's new bugs under certain levels of load that we didn't ever see before.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:51.820]   And so this is stuff.
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:53.380]   Kevin, I commend you.
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:58.420]   And doing this kind of stuff sucks when you've got users and particularly people who rely
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:03.620]   on this and you and you try to progress things and change things.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:04.620]   It's hard.
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:05.620]   It's really, really hard.
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:09.060]   I've been in that position in a smaller scale and it's it's tough.
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:11.340]   It's no wonder you're drinking beer.
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:12.340]   That's right.
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:14.860]   He was drinking beer long before this.
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:17.700]   It's because you don't have enough room in on your stuff.
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:18.700]   Look at his.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:23.340]   Oh, we didn't get to talk about Mike Harrington and his is a blinkbait post.
[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:27.700]   What exactly did Mike was I trying to figure out what Mike was trying to say.
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:29.940]   Basically he was saying it's not our fault.
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:30.940]   We try.
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:34.660]   We really want to have women on, but they're just aren't any.
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:35.660]   Is that or it's their fault.
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:37.380]   He knew it was a hot button.
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:38.380]   Oh, of course.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:43.260]   He loves putting his finger on things where he knows there's heat and fury.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:46.020]   And it's been a hot button for a long time.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:52.100]   The first programming conference I did in the 1990s, basic visual basic programmers inside
[01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:58.140]   the Insiders Technical Summit had 425 men and two women show up.
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:45:59.700]   This has been a undercurrent.
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:05.660]   It comes up every year or two years when, hey, there's a show that has no women on it.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:08.940]   Somebody will write a blog post and say there's no women on to it.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:14.180]   Everybody will get their up in a bud a bunch and we'll talk about it.
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.540]   That's what happened this weekend.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:24.140]   I think there's a very legitimate point to be made which is it's if there are not many
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:29.340]   women, it's passing the buck to say it's their fault or there aren't any women.
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:37.780]   But it's a two way street and I think that there is it is also very difficult for women
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:39.020]   to make it in technology.
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.300]   They are deprecated there, put down.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.860]   It is not an easy thing.
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:43.860]   Absolutely.
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:45.540]   And just look at the comments that TechCrunch posts.
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:46.500]   Absolutely.
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:55.500]   And I think it's a little reprehensible of Mike to go for the hits.
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.500]   I agree.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:57.500]   I agree, Leo.
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:58.500]   I only have one word for Mike.
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:46:59.500]   Doosh bag.
[01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:00.500]   And there he is.
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.500]   Our doosh bag of the day.
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:03.500]   Mike Arrington.
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:04.500]   Oh boy.
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:05.500]   You're asking for it.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:09.500]   We're going to sit out the little doosh bag to Mike.
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.500]   We got a one package done for him.
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.500]   Wow.
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.500]   Just comment that Aaron did not say anything.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:16.500]   That maybe women are too nurturing.
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:17.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500]   Why is everybody so scared of Mike Arrington?
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:20.500]   Are you scared of him?
[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.500]   Rip you apart on his freaking blog.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.500]   Screw him.
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.500]   Oh.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:25.500]   Rip me, Mike.
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:26.500]   Right?
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.500]   No.
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:28.500]   You know what?
[01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:29.500]   I don't think that's a view.
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:30.500]   Mike will not rip me.
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:31.500]   He's too scared of me to rip me.
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:32.500]   Oh.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:33.500]   You know what?
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:37.300]   He's not scared of me because he doesn't care about me, but he's scared of the twit army and
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.500]   he knows that that would be a mistake.
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:40.500]   Oh.
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:41.500]   Oh yeah.
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:42.500]   I agree.
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:43.500]   I think that is a huge mistake.
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.500]   The army is no joke, man.
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:49.500]   They are no you're not messed with the twit army.
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:50.500]   No, I don't.
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:51.500]   I don't have anything.
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:52.500]   It's Mike.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:55.500]   I just I do have something against and I think it's very bad for the ecosystem.
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:48:02.500]   People who post link bait articles because it's all about getting hits, not about real content
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.500]   and real and real discussions.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:05.500]   This is a real subject.
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:11.500]   This is not this is not a minor subject to cover and to use it for link bait is a big mistake.
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:12.500]   Yeah.
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:17.860]   We talked about this on our agenda this morning is all kinds of weirdness in media in general
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:18.860]   about women.
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:20.900]   You know, there was this summer's Eve ad.
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:26.100]   You know, if you want to ask for a raise, you've got to literally be smell nice down
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:27.100]   there.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.100]   I'm like, Oh my God.
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:30.020]   And look at magazines and how you're supposed to look.
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:35.980]   And I feel very bad for for what media and people like make Mike Arrington are doing to
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:36.980]   women.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:41.460]   I have an 18 year old daughter who was very smart, who was will be.
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:45.300]   And if she wants to be very successful in anything she wants, if she wanted to be in
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:50.340]   technology or science or math, she's going to have a much tougher road.
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:51.340]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:55.460]   And if she wants to be in sociology, psychology, any of the soft stuff.
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:49:01.540]   Yeah, I disagree with you, Leo, because if you do go through the computer science program
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:06.820]   and you get a computer science degree, you have a lot of opportunities available to you.
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:07.820]   Well, that's what Mike's saying.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:11.220]   He's saying if the few women who are in and have more opportunities, okay, out of the
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:13.260]   two, it's a social Robert.
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:15.900]   It's a social statement.
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.100]   I mean, look at the view.
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:19.180]   I mean, you know, this is what you're supposed to be.
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:22.180]   You're supposed to be a yenta who talks about nothingness.
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:24.460]   This is look at how women are portrayed in the media.
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:25.460]   This is why this happens.
[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:28.500]   And if you want to go left and you want to do something a little different, that's
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:29.940]   where you it's appear.
[01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:30.940]   Personal mind.
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:34.180]   The main geek is a woman, right?
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:37.300]   You know, there's there's examples on both sides of that fence.
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:38.300]   It's also hot.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:41.900]   It is a deep problem and it goes back to college.
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:47.980]   In my first year of computer science classes, there was about 40% women, second year, 15%.
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.180]   It starts there.
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:56.540]   And that's why arguing it out about, you know, getting more people on stage at conferences
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:58.660]   really isn't hitting the right problem.
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:01.460]   The right problem happens earlier.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:04.380]   I think this I wish we weren't running out of time, but we are.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:05.380]   Whole different show.
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:06.780]   I would love to do more on this.
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:08.140]   We will all gather again.
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:11.820]   I knew that when we got this many people, this many great people in the studio that we were
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:12.820]   going to have a great show.
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:13.820]   And I think.
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:15.980]   Well, Leah, why don't we, why don't you have any women on this show?
[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:17.980]   Well, you know, we have a lot of women to twit.
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:23.380]   We have Sarah Lane, we have Becky Worley, we have Denise Howell, we have Deei Severy.
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:26.060]   That's what they're well, I can see the Twitter is gone.
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:29.940]   Hey, this is well, we I'll have a woman next time we we always invite always invite at
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.540]   least one or two women to be on the show.
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:36.340]   We have five panelists today that was so many that I couldn't invite anymore, but I almost
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:39.340]   always invite some at least one woman to be on.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:41.740]   Look, there I would like to get more people of color.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:42.740]   I'd like to get more women.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:44.260]   I like to get more diversity in general.
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:45.580]   I'm doing what I can.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:47.900]   Many of our hosts on Twitter are women.
[01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:51.700]   And that's a that's comes out of a very large percentage of hosts like.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:56.260]   And frankly, the people who run this company are women.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:57.260]   And I'm proud of that.
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:51:02.420]   And but that's because I'm trying to be gender blind and color blind in what we do.
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:03.420]   And you're right.
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:07.700]   I'm not a woman on this panel, but I believe me before we top this top ticket subject
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.420]   on again, I will get some women on.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:11.020]   I knew you would answer that the right way.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:12.700]   That's why I asked that.
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:14.140]   You can ask tough questions, Robert.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:15.140]   It's okay.
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.140]   I won't.
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:16.900]   No, the problem is industry wide.
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:19.620]   It's not just one show or one person.
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:21.100]   It's more than industry wide.
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:22.780]   It's science and technology wide.
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.860]   And it's a big it's a big waste, if you ask me.
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:28.660]   It's a big waste of talent.
[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:32.900]   And I think that to do, you know, link bait around that is of course on the other hand,
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:34.580]   he stimulated a great conversation.
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:36.580]   So maybe it wasn't completely wasted.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:37.580]   I don't think so.
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:42.700]   I think it's good that we talk, but we don't talk intelligently about this issue.
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:44.780]   And I don't see that happening.
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:50.460]   I mean, you know, on the on the other side, women are doing all these women only conferences
[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:52.860]   now blog her and other things.
[01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:53.860]   Does that really help?
[01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:55.860]   I mean, it's ghettoizing.
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:52:00.740]   Yeah, because you here's an example of something that I saw it in my career.
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:02.660]   And I've seen it happen a few times.
[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:05.740]   In 2002, I did a dinner and we made it open.
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:09.740]   So there was no, you know, we said, if you want to come, you're anybody's welcome to
[01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:10.740]   come.
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:12.260]   And I think two women showed up.
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:16.380]   Ben and Mina Trot, Mina Trot was one and I forget the other one.
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:19.020]   But 40 other people showed up and they were all men.
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:24.740]   And a lot of people in that room now are the people who run Twitter, you know, Evan Williams
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:25.740]   was there.
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:31.300]   Ben and Mina Trot, who run six apart with their Dave Weiner was there.
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:34.780]   Brad Brad, who started Live Journal was there.
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:42.380]   And if you aren't there while things are taking shape while there's some networking opportunities,
[01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:44.540]   you're at a real disadvantage.
[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:46.140]   Yes, you're at a real disadvantage.
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:51.020]   And those are the people who decide, you know, conferences and books and all sorts of things,
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.980]   you know, real powerful people now.
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:59.020]   And it's a tough problem that starts early in somebody's career.
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:02.180]   And I don't know how to switch it, you know.
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:04.940]   Well, this is a conversation that will go on for a long time.
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:08.380]   And I'm glad we started it, but we're not done with it and we will talk some more.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:11.580]   It's been happening for 15 years and well longer.
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:15.060]   I mean, you know, you look at some of the pioneering women in this industry.
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:17.860]   I almost feel like we shouldn't be talking about without some women on the panel.
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:20.180]   So maybe we'll, yeah, you're here.
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:22.180]   This is your right, Leo.
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:24.340]   This is a conversation that should be had with women in the room.
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:25.340]   Right.
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:26.780]   A bunch of guys say, what do we know?
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:27.780]   What do we know?
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:28.780]   We know nothing.
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:30.500]   We don't know nothing about nothing.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.860]   We were testosterone poisoned.
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:35.340]   Thank you, Kevin Rose dig.com.
[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:36.820]   Thanks for having me.
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:37.820]   Appreciate it.
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:42.420]   Dwight Silverman at the Houston Chronicle blogs.com.com/techblog.
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:43.420]   Always great to have you.
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:44.420]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:45.420]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:46.420]   Always great to be here.
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:51.860]   And don't forget he's got a great radio show on Pacifica in Houston.
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:52.860]   Can I pimp my book?
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:53.860]   Yeah.
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:54.860]   What's the book?
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:55.860]   The book.
[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:56.860]   The book.
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:57.860]   The book is out.
[01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:01.420]   It's switching to a Mac, no problem from Wiley.
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:04.380]   Hit the bookstores last week.
[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:07.980]   And it's a great way to, if you want to go from Windows to the Mac, it's a great way
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:08.980]   to do it.
[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:09.980]   Very good.
[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:10.980]   Thank you.
[01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:11.980]   Look forward to seeing that.
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:13.740]   Robert Scobel is the scobelizer.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.220]   He needs no introduction.
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:18.020]   Maybe he can help me with my tweet and buzzer problems.
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:19.820]   Well, I already tweet.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:21.380]   I already buzzed on your beat.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:22.780]   I said, hey, calm down everybody.
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.780]   He's having a problem.
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:26.820]   Well, and I have an alibi.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:29.380]   I was doing a show when it happened.
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:30.980]   It wasn't me.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:33.260]   Maybe I've been hacked.
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:35.620]   Scobelizer.com, anything else you want to plug?
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:38.580]   Of course, you do those great videos of Building 43.
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:40.220]   YouTube.com/scobelizer.
[01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:42.780]   I just took a tour of NASA that was awesome.
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:43.780]   I love that stuff.
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:44.780]   The wind tunnels.
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:45.780]   They let me go in the supersonic wind tunnel.
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:46.780]   That was cool.
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:51.340]   We basically copying you with a lot of these things we're doing with the live view now.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:54.060]   Oh, well, you were down to South by Southwest.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:55.060]   That was fun.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:56.300]   Are you going to do that again in the spring?
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:57.300]   Let's do that again.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.300]   Yeah, let's do that again.
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:54:59.300]   Let's get it.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.420]   People have been trying to get Curry to come along.
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:02.420]   Adam?
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:04.420]   Come on down to Austin, baby.
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:05.420]   I'd love to.
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:06.420]   Sounds good.
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:08.820]   I bet you have a pair of cowboy boots in that closet back there.
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:09.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:10.820]   I got the cowboy boots.
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:11.820]   I got my bolo tie.
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.820]   I'm ready to go.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:13.820]   That's a snake skin, baby.
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:14.820]   That's right.
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:15.820]   That's a snake python.
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:16.820]   It's on.
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:17.820]   It's on.
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:18.820]   I'm the bird.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:19.820]   I'm the bird in that twice.
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:20.820]   Big app.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:21.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:22.820]   I got it right here.
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:23.820]   Big app show.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:26.060]   This is really a great idea.
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:28.020]   You got an app on the iPhone.
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:30.580]   Well, it works fine on the iPad.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:31.580]   And you get your...
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:33.140]   No, no, Leo.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:34.140]   This is the whole point.
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:35.580]   The video is produced in portrait mode.
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.580]   So you turn it around.
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:38.580]   It doesn't...
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:39.580]   And you get it.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:40.580]   There you go.
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:41.580]   And you get it every day.
[01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:42.580]   You get a new one.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:44.580]   And you app every day.
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:45.580]   Isn't it clever?
[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:47.060]   Free apps, paid apps, just good apps is what I try to do.
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:48.060]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:49.060]   There he is.
[01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:50.060]   Very attractive, young man.
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:51.060]   Thank you.
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:57.460]   So if I can just plug NoahGendashow.com with the fabulous John C. Devorak, which we do
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:02.180]   on Thursdays and Sundays and of course on the podcast at NoahGendashow.com.
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:06.660]   There's really no need to plug that because it's...
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:08.940]   It just speaks for itself.
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:09.940]   Wonderful show.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:13.380]   And I really, really appreciate you having me on, Leo.
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.900]   I would like it if it doesn't take three years to get back on again.
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:18.540]   Come back again in about two.
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:19.540]   A lot of fun.
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:20.540]   Okay.
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.540]   You're such a man.
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:23.540]   No.
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:24.540]   We'll have you on soon.
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:26.260]   You know, it's always great to have you.
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:27.260]   Thank you, Adam, for being here.
[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:28.420]   Thank you all for watching.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.420]   We do have a special we did on Friday.
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:33.540]   I want to give a little plug to our government 2.0 special.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:38.900]   Tim O'Reilly, Jennifer Poshka and a bunch of really interesting people from government
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:42.860]   and private industry talking about a new way of thinking of government.
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:47.260]   Government as a platform like the iPhone or Windows as a platform that people can develop
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:50.180]   for and improve.
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:56.060]   And it's a very exciting thing that maybe might transform how you think of government.
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:58.340]   It's on our Twitch specials feed, twitter.tv/specials.
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:02.380]   I don't usually plug stuff on this show, but it was so important.
[01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:03.380]   It was so interesting.
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:05.180]   I'd like you to give it a try.
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:06.180]   twitter.tv/specials.

[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:30.060]   It's a laptop bag.
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:31.900]   I know it's not a first.
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:32.900]   It's a laptop bag.
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:36.260]   Hey, I want to remind everybody before we go that we are having a Twit meetup.
[01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:38.380]   I won't be there, but who cares?

[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.580]   What day is that?
[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:05.780]   Is that Saturday night or Friday?
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:07.380]   Anyway, Saturday.
