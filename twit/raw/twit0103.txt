[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   We have the reigning monarchs of the gadget world on the show today,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   ladies and gentlemen. The crown jewels of gadgetry.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I don't even know where to begin, so I'm just going to do it in
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   alphabetical order, starting with Richard Baguoli, who is...
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   >> Hi there.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   >> Are you editor in chief, editor? What is your title?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   >> I'm the editor in chief of wirelessinfo.com.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   >> Wireless.

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Those of you who said enough with the iPhone hype already,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   but we've got to do one show where we really...
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Now that we all have them.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And in fact, I think among the five panelists here,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   we've got over two dozen iPhones.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So I think it's... I think we're pretty well equipped here.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Welcome, Richard. It's good to have you your first time on Twit.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Let's see. That's B-A.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Now, B-E is Veronica Belmont from Buzz Out Loud.

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And Gadget.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   >> Hello.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   >> The number one, I think, Gadget Blog.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Is there any other? I don't think so.

[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Because I can't think of really a better group to talk about the iPhone.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   We could have Devorak on.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   But I'll tell you what. Let me do what Devorak would do.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   >> Or would be the fun in that.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   >> Oh, no, but I really wanted to do it Devorak.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   >> All right. You all take turns.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   >> Devorak.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   >> I was looking forward to that as well.

[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   >> I wanted to.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   >> All right. Tell me, Ryan, what would Devorak say about this?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   >> I thought that Ryan, Ryan, I thought that John Devorak.org/blog.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> Thank you. We're done.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's it. You're exactly right.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   We don't need John anymore. We can channel him.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> All right, John.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   >> He's been all along kind of an anti-iPhone guy.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And I doubt very much he's changed his tune.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I certainly don't think he's had an iPhone.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And I think that that was one of the critical elements for me was that everybody on this show
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   at least have had an iPhone for 15 minutes.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And I know that's you, Callie Lewis.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   >> Right.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> You've owned one for longer.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> I was so excited when I got the activation email finally.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   >> So I had an iBloc, an inactive iBloc for a little while.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Wow.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So you bought it. Did everybody wait in line here?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   >> I did.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   >> I did.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   >> Ten hours for me.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   >> Ten hours for Callie. How long Veronica?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> Only about five.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   >> Six for me. Richard, I know you didn't have to wait in line, right?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   >> Well, no, we did. We were out there at 3 o'clock in the morning on Friday outside the mall in Cambridge here.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   >> And Ryan.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   >> How about you, Ryan?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   >> I would say it was about ten, but I waited in a number of lines.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We kind of did a multi-city line blog.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> Wow.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   >> That's what I call that.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> Have fun.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   >> And we just covered every single Apple store line that we could possibly do.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So I was all over the South Bay covering different sides.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   >> Instead of live blogging, they did line blogging.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> I like it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   >> So it's --
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> I told you I'd bet you.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> You might say we were doing lines.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   >> Not only 24 iPhones among us, but also about 24 hours spent in line among us.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> And here's the joke on all of us.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Today you could wander into an Apple store, leisurely stroll in,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   plunk down your five or six hundred bucks and walk out with an iPhone.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   >> Not so.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   >> In San Francisco.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   >> It sold out?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   >> No, there's another line out at the San Francisco store.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   >> Interesting.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   >> Yeah, but it wasn't a first time.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   >> People returning it.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> I wouldn't give up the experience for anything, though.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   That was amazing.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   >> It was a sense of community, wasn't it?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It was great fun.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Or the closest thing all over the city.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   >> All over the city.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   >> I was a little -- I have to say I was nervous about being too public in line.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I went to the small AT&T store in Petaluma because I didn't want to look like a fanboy.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I didn't want to kind of blaze in my name out there as a fanboy.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I was waiting in line as all of you were because we needed to review it as soon as possible.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And Apple wasn't going to FedEx me one Saturday delivery, so I had to go buy one.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Do you think that in some cases the journalists were a little bit too --
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I don't know, pro, iPhone even before it came out?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   >> Well, I mean, there was a whole pipe factor of the whole thing.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.160]   We really had no choice but to talk about it because that's what everyone wanted to hear
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   about for the most part.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.400]   >> And Apple very cleverly managed the news cycle by dribbling out news releases over
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   the six-month period.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   >> They're very good at that.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.000]   I think some people kind of got swept up in the whole thing, though, you know.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And it's very easy to do.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.920]   You know, there was so much hype going on on this as well.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.520]   So many different things happening and they released all that news over the week before.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.400]   It's bit by bit and they managed that pretty well.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.960]   So it's kind of easy just to get swept up in the whole thing.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.040]   >> I think the hardest part is being a journalist and kind of getting host by Apple was that
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.440]   they were giving -- you know, they gave it out to the four journalists, the, you know,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.680]   USA Today, Newsweek, and then of course Mossberg and Polk.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.920]   And then all the other journalists just had to kind of fend for themselves and wait for
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   it to come out.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.480]   And it was kind of, you know, kind of a big FU to the rest of the media world.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.680]   >> Well, worse than that, I think that as a result, those big four, Newsweek, the New
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.080]   York Times, USA Today and the Wall Street Journal were a little bit kinder to the iPhone
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   than it deserves perhaps.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.680]   >> Yeah, but this is how it goes every single time there's an Apple product launch.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.760]   And I would say the number one accusation that flies towards Polk and Mossberg is that
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.720]   they're Apple fanboys and that it goes hand in hand with the fact that they're constantly
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.800]   getting pre-release Apple units and they're among the only people in the world getting
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.960]   pre-release Apple units.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.440]   So, you know, I would like to say that I was pretty upset, but I really wasn't because
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.360]   we all knew, you know, in our heart of hearts that they were going to get to units and we
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   all prepared ourselves.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360]   >> It wasn't unexpected.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   It was just kind of annoying.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.760]   >> I was prepared to be more upset when the Apple TV came out only Mossberg at the Wall
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   Street Journal got it.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.640]   Polk had to wait like the rest of us.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.640]   That would have upset me.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.360]   >> I remember Polk having an early review on.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   >> Did he?
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   Not as early?
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   >> Yeah, he really liked it.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   >> Okay.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   All right.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   But not as early as well.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.360]   >> All right.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   >> All right.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   >> But not as early as well.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.360]   >> All right.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   >> Walt got it a week before or 10 days before everybody else did.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   >> I had a solution in a moment for just thinking, you know, this is so frustrating.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.360]   They're so exclusionant.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.200]   You know, they've got this exclusive club of these four people and it's very frustrating
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.960]   that they won't let anybody else in.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.800]   >> Well, they didn't need to let anyone else in.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   >> No, they don't need to.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   >> Yeah, that's a lot.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   They needed the hype.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.120]   >> And the hype is taken to a new level because, I mean, I asked my mom if she knew
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.600]   about it and she doesn't know about, you know, technology news or anything.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.280]   She knew exactly what it was, what it did.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.120]   Even Neil's grandmother knew it as the phone that does everything but washer dishes, you
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.120]   know.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.280]   >> But I mean, is the hype justified?
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.600]   And I think that's what the real question is here.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.240]   There's no denying that there was an enormous amount of hype about this device.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.840]   But why was there so much hype?
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.560]   I mean, Apple always has a certain amount of hype going around it's a product release.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.760]   But why did this one catch such a nerve on pop culture in its entirety?
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.640]   I have to think it's because it's really true that almost everyone hates their cell phone
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.440]   and almost everyone wants something that's going to do all of these tasks in a much more
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   easy way for them.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.280]   >> It was for many of us, the Holy Grail.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.520]   We said Steve Jobs save us and we're going to get to but not yet whether Steve did his
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.360]   job or what he did, whether he did save us.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.560]   What I'd like to do organizationally is start with the line experience, go on to what it
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.960]   was like to buy it if you feel like it was well done, how activating went.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.360]   We'll talk to, not Veronica Callie about that one because I actually had some trouble.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.760]   And then I think at the end, let's, and it won't be quite the end, but let's get to
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.520]   the user experience and what it's been like using one of them.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.800]   You said Callie that the line was like Woodstock.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.400]   >> Well, yeah, what I know of it and the closest thing I'd ever get to it.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.160]   I thought it was an amazing experience.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:45.000]   I wouldn't give it up for anything because we got there, I was 28th in line and we all
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.160]   made friends with the five or six people around us and we didn't care about if you needed
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   to go to the bathroom.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.800]   >> Well, we'll hold your spot and it was a very friendly experience.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.640]   >> Unlike the PlayStation 3 lines, there was no violence.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.400]   >> Right, yeah, exactly.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:07.640]   But then we get 15 minutes out and people start trying to get in line and the one lady
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.080]   that was beside me, she was super sweet the whole day and then somebody comes in line
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.800]   and she turns and she said, "What are you doing?"
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.320]   She gets so upset and she starts, "No, you're not."
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.380]   She calls security over and there's a big fight and we couldn't turn our camera on because
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.400]   mall security wouldn't allow us to turn our camera on and I wanted to capture that because
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.560]   I thought something was going down.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.560]   >> Ryan, you waited for the Woodstock experience.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.960]   >> Yeah, there was some Woodstock there.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.200]   Don't eat the brown.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.720]   We actually had ice cream handed out to us from Coldstone.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   It was next door to the AT&T store.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.160]   >> Oh, you're lucky, man.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.000]   >> And AT&T was given out water.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   But AT&T matched their hospitality with something that I thought was a little weird, which
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.320]   was the upsell.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.480]   They went down through the line several times trying to sell their DSL.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.800]   In fact, there were some other pitch men.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.320]   There was a woman selling golf lessons or something.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   There were other people.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   We were captive on it.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.960]   Ryan, you were line blogging.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.200]   You went to see a number of lines.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.960]   Is that experience that Callie had pretty typical across all of them?
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.640]   I mean, it was a very palatable sense of goodwill in the air.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.120]   Everyone is really excited to be there.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.440]   Really excited to be a part of it.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.760]   Everyone is super stoked to be getting their device, which is no surprise.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.960]   I mean, anybody's going to be waiting in a line like that.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.600]   I think is going to be really happy about picking this thing up.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.080]   >> Was there a difference between the Apple line and the AT&T line?
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.880]   >> You know, I didn't actually get to check out any AT&T lines personally.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.560]   We had a couple of other people at the AT&T lines that, by and large, they were obviously
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.560]   a lot shorter.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.360]   >> They had a lot less phones.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.040]   I think they all had 60.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.040]   Mine had 60.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.040]   >> They had a lot of phones.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.880]   My suspicions were correct.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.920]   They churned through customers.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   I think we've mapped that.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.320]   It could calculate it at between 10 and 11x slower.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.520]   We actually saw people at Apple stores.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.800]   We counted about 150 customers would get through in the time that it would take between
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.680]   10 and 15 customers to get through at an AT&T store.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.080]   >> We noticed that as well.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.560]   >> Yeah, it was pretty unbelievable.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.520]   Obviously, Apple was the place to buy yesterday.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.000]   >> Ironically, because I think we're the community with Strongness.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.400]   >> Even Steve Jobs said, or as reputed have said, in an off-hand comment to somebody on
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.520]   a panel, I would go to the AT&T store.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.280]   It won't be quite the zoo.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.640]   They had a lot more phones at Apple and they handled the purchases a lot more quickly.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.560]   Let's get from each of you.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.200]   If you have an anecdote about a person in line, I'll start.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   It was kind of neat.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.440]   I had the same experience you did, Callie, where everybody around me kind of talked and
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.840]   became friends.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.040]   There was one woman who was a major gadget freak.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.000]   She said, "I haven't bought anything since January.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.400]   This is it for me."
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.280]   When she found out that she'd need to download iTunes 7.3, she called her husband, who she
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.440]   said is not a techie at all.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.280]   He's a rancher, and walked him through the process of downloading 7.3.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.280]   And he said, "Should I reboot?"
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   And she said, "Yes, reboot.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.680]   She was ready to come home and activate that sucker right away."
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.960]   There was also next to me about a high school freshman, 15 years old, with his skateboarding
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.960]   buddies.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960]   The three of them kind of hung out in line.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   Only he was getting the phone.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.760]   He went to the ATM machine, took out his last pennies.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.520]   He had it down to the dollar, held it in his little hands.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.160]   It was so sweet.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.160]   Does anybody feel like maybe given that you can easily get one?
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.360]   I mean, I don't think it's hard to get one now.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.440]   Any of us were crazy or really was, I think it was worth it.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.680]   I think it was worth it.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.040]   I think it was worth it as well.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   It was just going to experience.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   We went along.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   We had some fun.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   I met some nice guys from MIT.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.840]   We chatted for a bit.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   I was.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.400]   Everybody was very civilized and very polite.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.760]   There's only one thing where one guy on a wheelchair decided he wanted to join the line
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.600]   three people back.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.920]   He just basically lifted up the thing and drove in.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.200]   Fortunately, the security guard saw him and they quickly pulled him out.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.840]   That was the only sort of thing I saw that was any unpleasantness.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.440]   It was very, very, very civil.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.080]   I was in line with Ryan as well.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   Everyone was just really nice.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.760]   If you had to go up and use the bathroom, they'd hold your place.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.680]   People were leaving their laptops even and having people that didn't know watched their
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   laptops.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.000]   I was just going to get coffee and stuff.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.800]   I left my Sony e-book reader but nobody stole it unfortunately.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.480]   It was very impressive.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.640]   I got caught up in the whole thing because I wasn't even planning on buying one.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.360]   I was just there to get another review unit for CNET.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   That's right.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.360]   I was hanging out in line and covering the line for CNET TV.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.080]   Then I finally get up to the front and we're talking about it and everyone's all excited
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.600]   and I get to the checkout and they're like, "So, what can I get for you today?"
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.880]   I just go, "Ah, two eight giggers."
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.920]   I see the people with me were like, "What?
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   You're getting one."
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   I was like, "I don't know.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.720]   I guess I have to."
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.360]   Then I came home and I got back to work and they're like, "Oh, I see you got two."
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   I was like, "Yeah, one's for me, but I'm happy I have it now although I can't activate it
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.360]   yet."
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.440]   I've never seen anybody spend $700 or $600.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   I mean, all the whole stuff.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.920]   But not just you, everybody gladly forked over this.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.000]   What really is a lot of money.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   They were smiling.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Nobody.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   There was no pain being felt.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.280]   Even this 15-year-old who was spending his life's savings, he was gladly, happily doing
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   it.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.280]   How can he get it?
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.960]   I mean, I really think this speaks to this complete vacuum in consumer electronics where
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.080]   everybody carries a phone and nobody likes their phone.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.120]   For once, we got an opportunity to, for a lot of these people anyway, I don't want
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.640]   to speak for myself on this because I use a variety of phones.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.920]   But a lot of people got an opportunity to get a phone that they felt would really kind
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.280]   of meet all of their needs and be usable and fun in such a way that they never really
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.680]   had an opportunity to experience before.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.960]   I think that in itself really kind of proves the theory of the iPhone and that's that usability
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:57.640]   and design and user interface and the human factor, so to speak, is far more important
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.600]   than specs or features or any of that stuff.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   I know it's very true.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.880]   The amount of wonderment and awe that you get from using the phone, it's not something
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:14.360]   you ever get from a handheld device like that, especially not in the mobile department.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.400]   People are using this phone for the first time and flipping through photos and flipping
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.240]   through their list of contacts and everything you do with the phone is just a new experience
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.760]   that people aren't used to.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.640]   It's the whole between how it looks and how it feels and how it works.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.920]   I think you guys are getting people really excited.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.760]   You're still in the honeymoon period, guys.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.040]   I think there are some negatives here that people are going to come up with and they're
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.880]   going to be more and more frustrations.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.680]   We'll get to that though in a little bit.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   Any other stories from the line anybody wants to share?
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.080]   I was at the Palo Alto store and Steve actually ended up showing up there later, but I wasn't
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.080]   around.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.480]   There were some real celebrities there.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.240]   There was Bill Atkinson was there.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.240]   So was...
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   I forgot.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.240]   Scoville.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.240]   Scoville was there.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.160]   Weren't the dignity guys there too?
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.960]   Yeah, but I'm thinking more about Apple celebrities.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.360]   And Woz, of course, waited in line, but not in that store.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.960]   No, yeah, actually I got an opportunity to speak with Woz.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.800]   He was at the Valley Fair store and he sat down and gave a little chat for an Engadgeon
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   interview.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.960]   No, probably for nights about this whole thing.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.960]   Oh, he's great.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.400]   I think he enjoys being...
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.240]   He gets it and enjoys being among those people.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.880]   That's why he goes on the Geek Cruises.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   He doesn't want to hide out.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.480]   He wants to be among his fellow geeks.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   Anyway, so the anecdote is...
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.400]   I was at the Palo Alto store and this is a few hours before Steve got there.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.000]   I think it was maybe about one in the afternoon.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.120]   So about five hours before launch.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.520]   And I walked all the way down the block.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.400]   You know, maybe 200 people deep into the line at the end of the corner.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.960]   And as I'm sitting there kind of photographing the line to put in the line blog, this car
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.560]   pulls up to the left of me.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.360]   And I didn't really notice it because, you know, it was a busy street.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.640]   And then they stop and just lay on the horn.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.040]   And they were obviously trying to get some attention.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.640]   I look around, I'm like, what is going on here?
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.800]   And there's five people leaning out of the car, all snapping pictures on, you know, real
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.480]   proper iPhones, like laughing and hooting and basically like trying to catch everybody's
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   attention.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.360]   And then as soon as people start noticing that it's a car full of iPhone users, they
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.360]   peel out.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   That's just me.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.640]   It was pretty cruel, but I don't think anybody...
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.720]   Enough people notice too inside a rioter.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.960]   Honestly, renegade Apple employees, right?
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   Apparently so.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.200]   Well, I was the first person who was out of the store with the iPhone where I was in
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.680]   Cambridge and I was kind of concerned that somebody was going to jump me.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.040]   So actually what I did was we can kind of run off and we'd, one of my colleagues had
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.720]   his motorbike there and we'd like zoomed off into the distance.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.120]   Let's get it back to review it.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.560]   Oddly enough, AT&T seals the bags.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.000]   They have an adhesive on the inside of the bag.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.680]   Apple didn't do that.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.000]   AT&T was odd.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.440]   They sealed the bag.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.200]   But I think it was so that you wouldn't take it out in the store and open it right there.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.680]   But maybe it was to keep it from being lifted.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.280]   So activate...
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.000]   Actually, let's go to the buying experience.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.360]   Any issues with buying it, it sounds like the Apple was very straightforward.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.640]   You hand over the dough, they give you the phone.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.560]   I think the only phone that I had Apple was an AT&T.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.000]   I had to high-five everybody in the entire store.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Yeah, we got that too.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   There's people in there.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.360]   Yeah, there's a picture of Scott Bourne on the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   Practically.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.560]   I don't know if he's actually touching the ground.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.000]   Practically walking on air as he leaves an all-bunch of happy Apple employees.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.480]   Callie, what were you going to say?
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.560]   Oh, I just thought they did an amazing job at making you feel like a celebrity, you know,
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.360]   with the line of employees clapping you on and everybody's cheering and going in and going
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   out.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.000]   And partly, we were taping inside there.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.840]   So it was even more of a boost for me, I guess, coming in and going out.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.360]   So because I was on tape as well on camera for the show.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:57.520]   But I just, the whole experience, I mean, everybody was smiling and everybody had drunk
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520]   the Kool-Aid.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.200]   Actually, literally, we had Kool-Aid outside the line.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   Do they give you the best of luck?
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.800]   Well, I mean, let's be fair.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.440]   I think that if you're dropping $600 on a phone, plus it to your contract with no subsidy,
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.480]   yeah, you should probably get the celebrity treatment.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.680]   To hire a bunch of Apple employees, just follow me around and make me feel better when I drop
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   $600 on anything.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:23.040]   Like when I bought like a $400 Marc Jacobs purse, where were they clapping and cheering
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.560]   and not making me feel bad?
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.120]   The economy, yay.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.200]   Well, maybe they ought to be cheering.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.680]   It sounds like they have a lot of extra phones in stock.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.600]   Now, you said that San Francisco store is sold out, Veronica?
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.040]   No, they're not sold out.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.160]   They have a line again this morning, though.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.200]   Because if you go online, there's an Apple phone finder.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   And last night, after the store's closed, I went through it, and there wasn't a single
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.680]   store that didn't still have phones.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.360]   So they've obviously heavily supplied this.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.080]   The AT&T stores are dangerously close to selling out, if they haven't already.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   A lot of mine sold out.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.080]   At least the 8 gigabyte versions.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.880]   Yeah, everybody in line for mine, they sold out.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.200]   We were hearing rumors that like five people would walk in and then walk back out and they
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.880]   would be out of 8 gigabyte versions right away.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.920]   So they were sorely understocked in a lot of different places.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   Interesting.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.560]   I'm sitting getting them from the AT&T stores.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.960]   Yeah, they weren't even a real stock.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.600]   It's not the same experience.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.400]   Well, but some people don't have an Apple store in their area.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.400]   AT&T is all they have.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   And you know what?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   Yeah, I got the phone there.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.440]   I didn't mind going to AT&T.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.920]   I have to say, I had that very store.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:31.600]   I had been in with a singular phone and thrown up my hands and canceled my account some years
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.000]   before because of the lousy inattentive service.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.160]   And I don't know if they...
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.880]   It was because it was the iPhone or they were heavily trained, but it was a very different
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.040]   place when I went in there.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.960]   They were very friendly.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.800]   It did take about 18 minutes.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.080]   They said our computers are really slow.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.120]   I think it's because the AT&T stores were validating credit.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.200]   You know, they were actually doing credit reports on people.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.280]   Were they activating in-store?
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.880]   They weren't doing in-store activation, but they were doing kind of a pre-qualify.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.880]   It looked like.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.880]   Oh, weird.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.100]   Now, I had an advantage because I have an AT&T phone, a blackberry, so I was just taking
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.100]   over that phone.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.100]   It was much faster for me.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.100]   It was very quick.
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.080]   But there was quite a sluggish line for a while, which is good.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.480]   They only had 60 phones.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.400]   If they'd had 500, it might have been a problem.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:22.800]   I had a very interesting experience with calling my AT&T mobile customer service yesterday.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.640]   So I have T-Mobile currently.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.160]   And I just wanted to see how much time I had left on my contract.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.200]   So I gave them a call and I said, "I just want to know when my contract is up."
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.840]   And he said, "Oh, July 10th."
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   I'm like, "Oh, okay.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.500]   I thought it was the 28th."
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.740]   And he said, "Why are you canceling?"
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.660]   And I said, "No, no.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.660]   I was just curious."
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.660]   And he goes, "Okay.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.180]   You're not planning on getting a new phone today, are you?"
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.740]   And I was like, "No, dude.
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.740]   I was just curious.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.260]   I just wanted to know how much time my contract was left."
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.260]   And he said, "Okay.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.380]   Well, if there's anything we can do to make your experience more enjoyable, just let me
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.380]   know."
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.380]   And I said, "Okay.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.380]   I got to go.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.380]   Bye."
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.380]   I actually was very happy with T-Mobile.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.380]   Really?
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.380]   I like T-Mobile.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   I do.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.640]   I think it depends where you are, but I think the customer service is very good, but you're
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   right.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640]   Very good.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.560]   There's signals pathetic in most places.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.320]   And so I still can't activate my iPhone for another two weeks or so.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.680]   Oh, that's why you haven't activated it.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.040]   Luckily, I have enough to play with between home and work, but I can't actually activate
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.720]   my true iPhone for another until the 10th.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.980]   Because I just want to pay another $200 on top of the $600 I've already spent.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.780]   I don't believe you.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.780]   You had similar...
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.940]   You had real problems, Callie, activating your phone.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.660]   Mine activated in a couple of minutes.
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.900]   And again, it's because I wasn't doing a transfer of numbers.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.900]   I think that's what really took most people a long time.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.220]   I talked to somebody today on the radio show who was moving over from Verizon.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.900]   And they said, "Maybe Sunday.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.740]   What happened to you, Callie?"
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.920]   Well, I did transfer over numbers.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.640]   I transferred over my first one.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:07.960]   And I said, "I chose the option that I wanted to do both two iPhones."
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.760]   And went through the process, said it would take six minutes, of course, then I got the
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:17.040]   message saying that it's going to take another who knows how long.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.560]   And they'll send me an email and didn't get the email, didn't get the email.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.480]   So I called and they said, "It'll take 24 hours."
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.780]   Who was the carrier you were transferring from?
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.780]   T-Mobile.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.020]   See, I think you're at the most of that carrier.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.280]   Well, I called T-Mobile and they suggested because there had been some problems that I...
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.840]   Because I'd mentioned that the second line, it never gave me an option to give them the
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.200]   information on the second line that I wanted to transfer over.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.880]   And so they suggest I call them.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.480]   So I did call them.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.920]   And both AT&T employees, I called back two times just to see what the two different employees
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   would say.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.160]   And both times they said, "You do this and this and this."
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.640]   And then I confirmed, "Okay, so I do this and this and this."
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.880]   And they said, "Well, I believe that's how it works."
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   Yes.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880]   And I said, "You believe it?
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.520]   That's how it works."
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   And...
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   Yes.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.560]   Yeah, it's not instilling a whole lot of confidence in me.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560]   It did work.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.720]   I went ahead and did what they say and did the second line.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.600]   And it activated right away, which I was very upset.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.920]   That was Neil's and it activated right away.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   But then mine activated shortly after.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   So...
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.440]   But I was without it for a while.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   And...
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.080]   But the way they don't know anything, I mean, if you talk to any of their employees, it
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   sounds like...
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.480]   Is this AT&T that didn't know anything?
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:47.840]   Well, actually AT&T and Apple, I called Apple last night when I first got my phone and they...
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.240]   He was tripping over himself.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:56.600]   I was a little negative on the extra data plan that they require you to do with your friends.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:02.400]   I should play a little bit here from your most recent Geek Brief 1.9.2.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   You don't exactly lose it here, but you're not happy.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.360]   You're not out of the data with direct internet access along with visual voicemail and a host
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   of other goodies.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.920]   Under pricing and availability, the release says all plans include unlimited data, email
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:19.200]   and web, visual voicemail, 200 SMS text messages, rollover, and it's an unlimited mobile.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.440]   You were not happy because it wasn't in fact flat-ray.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   Right.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.600]   Everywhere you go, you go from one page to another page and it says all unlimited...
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:34.800]   All plans include unlimited data and you get to the activation process and you have to
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.240]   pay additional for additional data.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.880]   And that is for the second phone's data, but they don't percentage that way at all.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   Oh, it's because you have a family plan.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   Right.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.880]   I got it.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:56.560]   And so I was upset about that and I did talk to an Apple employee and he was tripping over
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   himself.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.720]   He didn't know how to respond to me one bit.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.240]   Well, okay, well, I mean, that's a conversation.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.520]   He probably hasn't seen the iPhone himself yet.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.720]   He's probably going to be trained five minutes before.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.480]   They're all getting one in July though, right?
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.080]   Every Apple employee with a year, 10 year or more is getting a free iPhone.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.960]   They did hire a lot of seasonal employees, seasonal being for the iPhone employees.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   So maybe they just didn't know the ropes yet.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960]   AT&T at 2000.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.920]   Yeah, those seasonal employees are probably not too adept.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.440]   So everybody here has activated except those of us who have declined to to save money,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.480]   to keep mobile money.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.960]   Was the activation pretty straightforward for everybody else?
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   Callie's...
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.200]   Yours is now activated, right, Callie?
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.400]   Yes, I got about 45 minutes prior to getting onto the phone.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.280]   So she's playing with it right now.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.280]   I am.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.800]   Pretty sure about that.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.240]   Everybody else activation went smoothly?
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   Yeah, activation.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.040]   All right, I didn't actually mention it before, but I'm talking on the iPhone now, which is
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.680]   why it probably sounds less...
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   Oh, you sound good?
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   High quality, yeah.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   No, wait a minute, though.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   I'm going to say this doesn't sound like a cell phone.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   It sounds like a landline.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   Oh, okay.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   Well, it isn't.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.520]   I'm talking on an AK iPhone, but yeah, I activated two units yesterday.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.560]   I both went through within just a couple of minutes, and this is right around launch time
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   and went.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.120]   I'm sure that they were under their heaviest load.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.120]   Put it on the speakerphone.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.120]   Let's hear how that sounds.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   Okay, I can check here.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:23.960]   So, the phone and the speakerphone, I'm pretty sure, you know, just uses the same mic pickup.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.640]   Are you holding it close?
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   Can you hold it a little bit lower?
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   So it'd be like...
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.720]   Yeah, so now I've got it down on the desk.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   Sounds excellent.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   Sounds...
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   Sounds like...
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.680]   The phone is actually tested in speaker phones, though.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.960]   And then do you have the earbuds?
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.960]   Can we try that?
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.120]   Yeah, can we just get back to the phone?
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.520]   I have to say the phone seems to work quite well.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.840]   It seems to be a pretty good phone.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.200]   Richard, I'm sure you guys are actually doing real testing instead of subjective impressions.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.320]   We have a very high-end audio testing system we use for our phones, which does frequency
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.200]   analysis and all sorts of things, and we run it through, and this was pretty much one
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.520]   of the best phones we've seen.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.400]   Certainly, for the sound that you receive, such as somebody talking to you, it was.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   It got the highest score we've had so far, and we've tested a lot of phones.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.600]   The send sound wasn't quite so good.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.480]   It was pretty good, but the receive sound was just...
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   Was really good.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.280]   I also notice there's not a lot of...
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.480]   Usually on a cell phone call, you'll hear a lot of interference and hissing and so forth.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.840]   I always thought that was the carrier, but maybe it's the mic.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.120]   I mean, I don't think all of a sudden AT&T has changed how they...
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.120]   How they...
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.800]   Well, it's a question of the interaction between the carrier and the device and whoever you're
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.320]   talking to is network as well.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.920]   So, certainly, on the all the calls I've made with the iPhone, walking around the streets
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.680]   of Boston, I've had no problem, and it sounded really good.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.840]   How about power?
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.760]   Is it a pretty powerful radio?
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.560]   You know, I haven't done an analysis on the signal strength yet.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.880]   I did some rough stuff on that, and it looks like it's got a fairly good antenna in there.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:59.880]   There's some guys, iFixit.com, who took one apart, and they show that the antenna is
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.840]   actually underneath a little plastic bit at the bottom.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.080]   That's the reason why you have that little bit of plastic.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.760]   That's where the two antennas are.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.680]   And it's a fairly good-sized antenna.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.560]   I haven't done our detailed analysis of the signal strength stuff yet, so I'll have to
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.480]   pass on that for right now, but I've not noticed any problems.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.000]   Ryan, you have the headsets on?
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.160]   Yeah, I'm on the headset.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.320]   I transferred over to that.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   Leave that on.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   It sounds better.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   That sounds good.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.320]   It sounds excellent.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.600]   You know, it's almost never that you get a headset that sounds better out of the box
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.800]   than what the actual phone sounds.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.640]   It sounds very, very good, I think.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.360]   They usually cheap out on the headsets, but this one looks... sounds pretty good.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.000]   I haven't won our testing on it yet, but I'm going to do that shortly.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.560]   But it sounds pretty good to me.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.480]   Something to keep in mind, the earbuds you get, they look like standard iPod earbuds.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   They're not.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   It's a three-ring tip that obviously has phone control and microphone in it.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.120]   And it's a deeper recessed connector.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.640]   You can't just use... none of my headphones work in it.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.840]   You're going to have to get a $10 adapter if you want to use your edomotics or your
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   shores or your ultimate.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.880]   That is an extremely annoying thing about the phone.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   Extremely.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.920]   I can't even understand why they would do that.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.640]   There's just no good reason to limit so many people from using their favorite pair of headphones.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.800]   I mean, that's the whole reason why you'd want to put a 3.5mm jack on a music phone like
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   this.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   Exactly.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.840]   Well, I get different headphones that have higher quality than the out of box pair.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.520]   Well, it'll be good for the aftermarket.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.200]   I'm sure that everybody will produce one with a microphone on it and the D-
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.400]   Yeah, Apple does a lot of things that are really good for the aftermarket and not very
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.400]   good for the consumer.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   One thing that did...
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.400]   You guys have spent 600 bucks on this thing.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   I don't want to spend any more.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.400]   I agree.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.400]   And we're going to talk to you a little bit about the...
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.040]   Well, let's talk about it now.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.360]   Why not?
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.440]   To me, the biggest lack here is the lack of third party applications.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.200]   There are a number of things on this iPhone that we ought to have that could easily be
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.200]   supplemented with a third party app that isn't there.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.200]   How long before Apple opens this up?
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.680]   I just got it.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.600]   Ryan, you want to say anything?
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.000]   Well, you know, there's been a lot of speculation about this.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.840]   It needs to be opened up.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   I think it's imperative.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:15.600]   Apple knows that I think that a lot of things I've read from Apple, you know, interactions
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.800]   with Apple employees, specifically around WWDC.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.080]   There was a lot of, you know, rumor going around that Apple employees were saying, "Yeah,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   we're going to do it.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   Just, you know, hold out.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   Hold on.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.080]   We're just going to, you know, do it right.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.200]   And it's not going to be a launch feature."
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:34.800]   The impression I got when, you know, I was sitting at D watching Walt drill Steve was,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   you know, at one point, Steve said pretty specifically we're going to give people what
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.760]   they want, just be patient and give us a thought.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.920]   I heard a rumor today that the SDK is in good shape on OS X. The thing that's holding
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.560]   it up is it's not very good on Windows.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   Anybody hear anything like that?
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.640]   I'm sorry, say it again.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.120]   There is an SDK, a third part for third party apps, but it's ready.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.360]   It's mature on OS X, but it is not near mature on Windows.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.040]   And they don't want to release it OS X only.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   Hmm.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   I didn't hear that.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.440]   Could be just a bogus rumor.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.560]   I have to point out, and I pointed this out on Map Break Weekly, there is a fourth row,
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.560]   empty row for icons.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.000]   It's not occupied.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.400]   And furthermore, there are two applications on here, stocks and weather that are very
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.520]   clearly Yahoo, confabulator widgets.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.520]   Hmm.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.520]   I mean, they're indistinguishable from the confabulator widget that I have on my OS X.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.600]   And of course, that makes sense because they're just JavaScript, CSS, and pings.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.960]   There's nothing special in these.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.800]   Yeah, the stock phone has a little Yahoo logo in the corner.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.120]   Yeah, it's got the, I mean, it looks exactly the same.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:46.160]   Well, I'm definitely going to, I expect there to be widgets, widget-like, you know, development
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.120]   very soon in the future for iPhone.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.080]   I just don't see why they would limit third party developers from making something like
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.560]   that when they have, you know, widgets on OS X, why not widgets on the iPhone or something
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.320]   that functions very much like it.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.240]   And every smartphone on the market allows third party apps, even the locked down sidekick
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.520]   allows third party apps.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.920]   You have to get approval, but at least it allows them.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.800]   I just feel so they probably just didn't have a quality control thing built in yet that
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.240]   made them feel comfortable with letting people develop the third party apps.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.520]   You know how controlling Apple is.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.840]   You have to look at widget development.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.480]   I mean, widget development is something that is very, very different from app development
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.280]   because when you look at widgets, I mean, you're basically just talking about, you know,
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.920]   HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and, you know, some HTTP calls.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.080]   I'm not talking about the actual building of the widgets.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.960]   I'm talking about the letting third party developers create a program for the iPhone.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.560]   I mean, that ability to let them do that.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.840]   Not the fact that there's so many, some kind of, you know, physical limitation to it.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.560]   I mean, you can't actually download files or upload files from the iPhone.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.640]   There's no file manager.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.080]   So they've kind of really excluded any kind of file interactivity on the device.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.040]   But, I mean, widgets themselves, there's no reason why they couldn't have launched with
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.560]   it at very least widget support.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:04.280]   So you kind of get that same, you know, dashboard widget ecosystem going on.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   The iPhone, as you have on a lot of other devices that have you know, more powerful app.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.280]   That was something I was expecting right off the top.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.920]   And when they said that wasn't going to happen, I was really surprised.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.320]   I kind of thought there would be at least a chat application.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.080]   They're trying to treat SMS's chat.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.520]   It looks just like I chats, got the little bubbles, even makes the I chat sounds.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   But it's not.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.440]   It's SMS and you're paying for messages.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.080]   You get 200 messages a month.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.840]   But if you're doing it, if I'm chatting with you, that's going to go buying about three
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   days.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.440]   And the SMS client is not good anyway.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.920]   Well, fortunately, if you want to get really tricky about it, you can actually log on to
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.600]   Nibo from the mobile Safari version.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   And you can't do IM over the webpage through Safari.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.800]   That's an excellent hack, yeah.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.400]   Which clients does Mibo support?
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   Is it all of them?
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.400]   All of that.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.640]   Yeah, most major ones.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   So cool.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.640]   That's good.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.640]   I'm going to log on to Mibo right now.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.640]   That's great.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   Yeah, it's no use.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.640]   I'm going to signal a course.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.200]   Well, and you wouldn't want to use it on edge.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   It's another problem, which is that the edge network, even though it's been improved, is
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   not very fast.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.880]   Have you tested the speeds on this, Richard?
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.760]   Yeah, we looked at, we did a number of speed tests and we'd never got beyond 100 kilobits
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   per second.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   Oh.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.720]   And you know, it's like, you know, that kind of makes the YouTube application rather pointless
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.360]   you know, if I want to look at skateboarding dogs, I want to look at them quickly.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.480]   You know, and I just can't do that on the edge.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.120]   It just takes too long.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.120]   The why?
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.960]   That's kind of really interesting because I was getting upwards of 160.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.880]   In fact, right before the night before the iPhone launched, I was testing on Motherhand
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.200]   sets and I was getting well over 250 Kbps on edge.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   So yeah, I mean, obviously it depends on, you know, where you are.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   You're in San Francisco.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   He's in Boston.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   There's the problem.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   Right.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   So I mean, the networks are going to be different everywhere.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.720]   You know, part of that does happen to rely on where you are.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.120]   And out here, I guess the edge is just a little bit better.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.840]   They did noticeably improve edge.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.760]   I mean, I was watching my blackberry and it felt faster.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.680]   They did do a lot of work on the network to bring out more edge capacitors here.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.280]   But it's still not.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.440]   Now I have to say the Wi-Fi implementation is excellent.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.920]   When I walk into my office, it doesn't, you know, it doesn't say anything.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   It just does it.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.640]   It's very easy to get access points.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.720]   It seems to be pretty snappy once you've got Wi-Fi working.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   Absolutely.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   Yes, so.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.920]   I won't use the edge service.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.560]   If I am a hermit, so I stay in the house and I have Wi-Fi.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.360]   And if I leave the house, I have mobile broadband.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.840]   So I will never use the data service.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.120]   I'll just use Wi-Fi.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:30.920]   And so actually I talked to AT&T and they said that you can cancel, you know, after
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.000]   you've set it up and everything, of course, you can cancel your data plan.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.760]   So I'm planning on doing that.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   Interesting.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.400]   Save myself the extra 20 bucks.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.120]   I'm not sure I follow you have mobile broadband, but that's not on your iPhone.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.280]   So then I can connect to Wi-Fi via that.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.280]   via her Wi-Fi.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   Carry a laptop and use eVDO.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.600]   Well, right, because I always carry that.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.240]   So if I want to use my iPhone, then I'll just connect to that and use the app.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   I think this actually speaks something really interesting about what Apple has done here
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.200]   and how they really missed the mark on the data.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.600]   The fact that people and you're not the first person I've heard say this are considering
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.360]   taking a laptop with a 3G card and using like carry a Wi-Fi over that to get higher
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.360]   speeds on their iPhone.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.360]   That's a good idea.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   Take the size of the iPhone.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.600]   You can actually really think about what you're talking about.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.040]   It's a completely ridiculous.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.360]   I think we really need to get 3G in this thing.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.600]   Well, I'm sure the second generation will, but here we are with our $600 first generation
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.600]   phone.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.760]   Some of us more than one, apparently.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.320]   I had a nightmare last night that they were releasing a 3G version next weekend.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.760]   Yeah, that would be a nightmare.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.840]   I actually had a nightmare that they were updating the iPhone like right away after
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   I bought one.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:42.000]   There was a rumor going down the line and saying, "Oh no, they're announcing right
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.080]   now before I'm even 6 o'clock."
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.680]   They're announcing that they're giving out a 3G in two weeks or something.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.880]   I would have stabbed myself in the eye.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.880]   That's just a shame.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   That's just a shame.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   That's just a shame.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   It's spreading a rumor like that.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   Who would do that?
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.040]   It would even be more ironic for me because I still won't even be able to use my iPhone
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.840]   until that next version supposedly will have come out and then I'll just have a dot
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.840]   of an iPhone sitting on the desk.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.000]   No, you can return it.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   You have some time.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   I know.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   I'm just teasing.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.760]   Let's talk about the keyboard because this is another area where Walt Mossberg, Apple
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.960]   fan Walt Mossberg said that, "Oh, give it time."
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.880]   Just as Apple does ironically, in a couple of weeks you'll feel very comfortable with
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.880]   it.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.840]   Now, we've only had it for less than a day, but I do not feel comfortable with it and
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.280]   I'm not getting better at it.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   I got to point out something.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.920]   It doesn't like my name.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.160]   It has a predictive algorithm, not T9.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.040]   Unlike T9, it doesn't learn.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:45.440]   When I start typing L-A-P, it won't let me type O. It wants me to type I or Q or almost
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.800]   any other letter, but O. It says, "No, there's nothing in my dictionary, L-A-P-O.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.200]   You can't continue.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.480]   I have to actually lift my finger off, go back down as if I'm starting another word
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.560]   and then I can type the O, then it does the same thing with the T."
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.640]   Now you'd think after I did that about 20 times, it would learn, but no, it doesn't.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.800]   I find this very annoying.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.920]   I had the same thing and obviously, just Apple doesn't think that I exist or something.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   I don't know.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   Really?
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   They don't know by Gully?
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   No, they don't.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   No, it's not.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.920]   I'm not talking the name, though.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.320]   So this is a problem.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   T9 at least learns.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.680]   The first time you give it a new word, it says, "Oh, okay.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.840]   I know Petaloma now and I'll get that right from now on."
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.240]   That seems to be a problem.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.200]   Is anybody getting comfortable with the typing?
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.600]   I thought the typing wasn't too bad.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   Really?
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.600]   You have little pointy fingers.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   I do.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.320]   Are you using single finger or one thumb or two thumbs?
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:41.160]   Well, I took the, he did the advice, Steve Jobs' advice and I started with a finger.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.120]   I haven't really progressed to thumbs yet.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.720]   I moved to thumbs pretty quickly and it wasn't too bad.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   I hate you for running a bell money.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   I hate you.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   Really?
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   So you're able to type pretty quickly on it?
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.880]   Yeah, I didn't find it to be too limiting for me.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.240]   But do you normally use the widescreen or the...
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.840]   Oh, that's another problem.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.920]   The widescreen keyboard is only in one application.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.400]   I just have the wordy keyboard on my dash that I usually use and that's a pretty small
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   keyboard as well.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.600]   So I'm not gaining or losing any kind of space for the keyboard.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   I feel like you're not losing space but you're losing tactility and you're losing
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   actual physical feel of key.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.120]   Yeah, and what I'm saying is I don't have too much of a problem with it.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.200]   Her brain is somehow adjusted to that notion that she doesn't have to have a key there.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.680]   I'm having a lot of problems with the keyboard.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.320]   I mean, I can do it pretty decently on one finger but it's just not working for me on
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.320]   two thumbs.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.680]   I have pretty stubby thumbs and maybe my anatomy is just not compatible with the iPhone yet.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   I don't know.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.080]   No, I have fat fingers too.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.320]   And Callie, you have fat fingers?
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   I didn't know this is about you.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   I have fat fingers, yes.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.320]   So you're having fun?
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   I don't like doubt that.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.280]   I will say the horizontal keyboard, the horizontal keyboard is so much better than the vertical
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   keyboard.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.040]   But it doesn't show up except on the browser.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.200]   Yeah, it only shows up in Safari but when I'm using it on Safari, I can instantaneously
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.480]   switch over to two thumbs and it feels more comfortable and grand because it's horizontal
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.440]   and it gives my fingers more room to actually grasp the phone.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.280]   Why in heaven's name would they not implement that across all apps?
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.280]   I don't know.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.840]   Maybe they'll see the demand that a customer will have.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.080]   Let's hope for a firmware update.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.280]   Well, this is an important point.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.400]   There are some things they can correct in software very easily like that.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.600]   There's some things they can't like a lack of a GPS.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.040]   No, you know, I mean, there's some things they're just not going to be able to fix.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.120]   The lack of Bluetooth stereo.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.000]   I was talking to somebody who said, "Oh, I can't wait.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.360]   I have a helmet that has Bluetooth stereo when I snowboard."
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.160]   And I said, "No, you won't."
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.800]   Well, actually to be fair, they can't add HTTP.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.680]   They can't add Bluetooth stereo via software.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   That's just a profile.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   Oh, they can't.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   Yeah, that's just a profile.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.680]   It's just a little bit of software.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.280]   Oh, it doesn't need hardware support?
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.000]   No, well, the phone has Bluetooth 2.0.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   So it supports the HTTP.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.720]   They just have to enable it.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.720]   I assumed it was a hardware.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.720]   We could have a little more frustrating.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   Right.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.480]   I think actually from the analysis I saw the components this morning, the Bluetooth chip
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.880]   does come with it can directly support a 2D PC.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.600]   So I think they may have actually at some point decided we're not going to do that right
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.600]   now.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.640]   I'm not certain on that, but I think-
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.640]   That could be a proposed firmware update.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.400]   Yeah, but certainly the Bluetooth is pretty much crippled.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   Hm.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.280]   Singular, sorry, AT&T do that, you think?
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.360]   No, I think this is all Apple.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.960]   Apple has car blanche on the phone.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   They can do whatever they want.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.640]   AT&T had no process whatsoever in the actual rollout of the device and what features it
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.640]   did or did not have it.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.920]   That doesn't surprise me, given that AT&T probably had the largest day in its history
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920]   yesterday.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.160]   Oh, I took a survey in line.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:36.040]   I don't know if anybody else did this or talked to people, but I asked probably about
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:44.400]   100, 120 people and 37% of them were switching to AT&T.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.280]   So the rest were already with AT&T or Singular and 100% of those people said that they would
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.480]   have switched had they not been with AT&T.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.480]   So I found that interesting.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.480]   That's very interesting.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.480]   I'm surprised it's only 37%.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.320]   Maybe that's a Bay area.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.360]   Well, I mean, that- Well, Dallas, so-
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.960]   I'm sorry you're in Dallas.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.920]   That doesn't surprise me that's a bigger sound about right from the gut feeling I had talking
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   to people in the line.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.520]   I think AT&T had a very good day yesterday.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.920]   I gave Apple a lot of the money that they made yesterday.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.840]   Well, Apple is definitely going to be making all their money on this via the hardware.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.880]   And that's why the phone is so expensive and it's not subsidized and-
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880]   Is it really not?
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.120]   Do we know it's not- I mean, we know it's expensive, but maybe it costs a thousand bucks to make.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.720]   You're pretty sure there's no subsidy here?
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.760]   It's my understanding that there is no subsidy and I can't see how there would be because
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:39.240]   again, Apple in these situations, I mean, they make their money on hardware.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.240]   That's what their margins are.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.760]   And there's no software money for them in the iPhone right now at the door.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.120]   I mean, they're not making money licensing.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.280]   They're not making money selling updates or anything else for the iPhone.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.520]   They're definitely not making money really selling content for the iPhone since we all
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.520]   know that they make absolutely nothing on music and very little on movies.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.480]   So really for them, it's about selling the hardware and that's why the phone is so expensive
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:07.680]   and AT&T is being such a stickler with a long contract and the almost $200 cancellation
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   fee if you cancel early because they need to get their cut too and they're getting
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   an own service end.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.640]   Well, that's why my cancellation fee would be on T-Mobile as well.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.640]   That's $200.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.400]   It's usually $175 or something like that.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   Some carriers pro-rated though.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.480]   So if you're only have like two months left and they'll give you that fraction of the
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   camera to be off.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   Right.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.120]   I've heard that Verizon does that, I believe.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.080]   T-Mobile does not to my knowledge.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.880]   What is Apple's profit margin?
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.920]   Anybody want to speculate on this phone?
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   I think it could be anywhere from $200 to $100.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.320]   I mean, it's going to be significant.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.840]   They have the highest margins in the business.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:50.600]   And I mean, whereas normal companies are going in like the single-digit percentages, they're
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   usually on the double-digit percentages sometimes up to 20 to 25%.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.760]   But to say for sure, I mean, they've been wrapping up for this for so long.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.760]   They've gotten really great distribution deals of Samsung for the flash memory that they've
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.920]   gotten all these things.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.000]   I mean, they've been really ready to do this thing.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.560]   So I would not spread it.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.440]   They're making a ton of money on the hardware.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.480]   Have you broken down the hardware components, Richard?
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   We're looking to do that.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.280]   We've got a list of all the components from the I fix it guys who took one apart yesterday.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.840]   And I don't know if I should actually not break it in the process too much.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.280]   There is nothing in there that from what I've seen so far that looks hugely expensive,
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.720]   probably the most expensive part is the screen.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.880]   It's a fairly standard.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.560]   The processes are fairly standard one and the Bluetooth modules are all pretty run at
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.080]   the mill once we've seen a number of other places.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.320]   So there's nothing in here that screams that this chip costs $500 on its own.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.160]   So I probably would agree with Ryan.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.080]   I think that Apple's making a fairly good profit on these things.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.480]   I don't think they're subsidizing it.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.520]   How many phones do you think they'll sell this weekend?
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.520]   A lot.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.680]   I've seen earlier estimates that they've moved at quarter million units.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.720]   There's no way of knowing and they're not going to release those numbers at least not
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.720]   for a while.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.560]   And this one is one of the best selling cell phones that we're going to see in a while.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.160]   Yeah, I was going to say what's the closest comparison?
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.840]   Is there the razor?
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.000]   What other cell phone has even come close to this kind of numbers during its opening
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   week?
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.800]   Well, you know, even the razor didn't really have these kinds of numbers.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:27.520]   I don't think during the opening week because at the time the razor was also $600 or $500
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.120]   I remember correctly as a debut, but people were not used to paying that much money for
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:37.520]   a phone as well as the fact that there was not this crazy insane, unbelievable, irrational
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.880]   desire to have this device because even though the razor was really sexy, it didn't do all
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.920]   these amazing things like movies, music, and then and now that everyone's obsessed with.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.440]   I have to see anybody come to out for the razor as far as I know.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   So this is unprecedented.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.920]   Oh, I don't think there's ever been a consumer product of any kind that's had this kind of
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.920]   one.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.520]   Well, I mean, there's a PS3 in the Wii.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:01.240]   I think the closest thing to coming near iPhone, mania, were the console wars this past year.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.920]   And Xbox 360 and the PS2.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:08.000]   I mean, those definitely had, you know, they both a huge reaction from mainstream consumer
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.720]   based, but this has been a whole other ball of wax.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.880]   I mean, we're talking about like the consoles.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:14.880]   It was just gamers.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   Right.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.280]   I mean, you're talking about people are interested in video games, but everybody.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.280]   Right.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   Everybody has a cell phone.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   It was interesting.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   I mean, it's an incredible demographic spread age wise.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.240]   I mean, just race.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.880]   I mean, it was it was a wide swath of the American populace.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:39.000]   And as we've seen from polling, the huge recognition factor, 86% of all students knew
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   about the iPhone and a large number of them wanted to buy one.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.600]   Two out of three Americans knew the name iPhone and they really Apple did a good job
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.560]   of making or if they did it, of making this a well-known product.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:54.720]   So the first people that came out of the store that I was at at the Stanford mall was a probably
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.360]   a eight year old girl that had an iPhone.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.360]   I was like, wow, she is spoiled.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.240]   Oh, man.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.840]   Well, my daughter wants mine and I told her, well, if I go back to my Nokia 95, you can
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.680]   have it and I'll be honest with you.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.320]   I don't know which way I'm going to go.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.720]   It's going to take them and use this.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.720]   You love that Nokia.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   I do.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.520]   And I'll tell you, in terms of functionality, Nokia's got this beat.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.920]   I mean, it's five megapixel camera.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.920]   It does video.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.080]   I can chat clients on it.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   I can do everything I want.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.080]   It's got cool.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.080]   You're a Jiku client.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.240]   Jiku, full GPS.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.880]   In terms of usability, the Nokia is clunky and it's like a PC versus a Mac.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.440]   It's not as elegant.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.120]   I have to say the iPhone screen is pretty stunning.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.120]   It's beautiful.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.320]   In any kind of light, this thing really shines.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.800]   Yeah, we were looking at them outside today and you could see it fine.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   Amazing.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.600]   You can't do that with your Mac.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.680]   No, no, you certainly can't.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.280]   I don't know what they're doing in here, but this is great.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.200]   The touchscreen works pretty well.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.280]   I have to say, there's no beach ball on this, but I know it's always 10 because it does
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.600]   beach ball from time to time.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.440]   I don't know if any of you have experienced this, but there are moments when the phone
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.320]   becomes unresponsive.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.240]   The only time I've really had that problem is when using Google Maps.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:13.440]   I've had it kind of get a little jumpy, a little almost freezing for a second, not
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.400]   quite and then going back into it when I'm zooming in on a point.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.120]   It's done that a couple times and I was like, "Oh God, I froze it!"
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.880]   Then it fixes itself right away.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:26.080]   Today, I've noticed that in a couple of apps too, but nothing too terrible.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:31.280]   I have to say, I'm not, this device is not outside of the shortcomings and I definitely
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.400]   have a number of criticisms about it, which we haven't really touched on too much yet.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.040]   Things that we don't really like about the device.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:44.360]   I will say that I think the total amount of time saved in within the fluid UI and just
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.360]   the general user experience, which doesn't have a lot of lag, that those few moments
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:53.760]   that it does kind of lag up and low down, are probably going to add up to less time wasted
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.760]   than on a lot of other devices.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.800]   I use a new phone every three or four days and I've never really seen a UI experience.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.680]   It's really good and quick.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.040]   It's very snappy, although when it's not snappy, I wasn't able to pick up a phone call today.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.600]   It was not responding to the button press at all.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.320]   I have it on video.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.000]   I was streaming at Stickom and people saw it.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.520]   There are times when it gets bogged down.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.400]   I'm not sure what it is in particular.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.440]   We know it's not a third party app anyway.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.520]   I've also had trouble with the voicemail.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.280]   I can't record a new greeting for some reason.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.440]   It just doesn't respond.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.800]   Is so is that an AT&T problem or is that an iPhone problem?
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   Also earlier, just before we went on, is trying to get my voicemail, it said voicemail unavailable.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.520]   Yeah, you know, I had that problem a couple of times as well.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.520]   That's an AT&T.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.160]   Your voice drum system that they're using is that it's new for them.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.320]   I'm sure they have a couple of bugs.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:42.320]   I'd expect that.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   Yeah, I would have...
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.360]   Yeah, that's not surprising at this point really, so...
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.160]   No, and I don't hold that in particular against them.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.640]   I do hold the ability not to answer a phone call against them.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   It's pretty fundamental, really, isn't it?
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.760]   Yeah, and I hope that was just an isolated incident.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.960]   I hope that doesn't happen again.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   Well, let's...
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   Okay, I'll tell you what.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.640]   Let's talk about what we like about it.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:06.520]   Then we'll talk about the negatives and then we can sum up with overall what this phone
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.520]   means.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.920]   So, I said I like the screen.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.440]   Any other things everybody, anybody want to say anything?
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.880]   Callie, what do you like best about this phone?
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:18.560]   In my 45 minutes of it, I love the screen.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.400]   I love the experience.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.360]   You know, I'm not often...
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.360]   Maybe it's my generation.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:29.720]   I don't know exactly, but when I see products that come out or services that come out,
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.160]   I automatically think, "Yeah, okay, that should...
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   That's right.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.440]   It should have happened like this, right?"
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.400]   And this is one of the only things in my lifetime that I have just been completely
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.040]   floored by and amazed by.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.360]   Unexpectively good.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.880]   Yes, and you know what?
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.880]   I mean, I've seen the videos.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.680]   I've been looking at this interface for forever, right?
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:57.280]   But I didn't think I would be excited to slide to unlock, but the first few times I
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.360]   did it I was.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:02.640]   And so that experience was more than I expected, I guess.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.120]   I tell you, when you go through your photo album using your finger to slide through
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.280]   it and then to zoom in, it is pretty amazing.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.000]   It's almost like you can feel it when you're flipping through the photos.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.200]   There's almost like a weird mental kind of traction with your finger when you're doing
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.200]   it with the photos.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   It's very strange.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.200]   I think you're doing an acceleration.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.400]   I think it's not linear, and so you'll see it goes faster and slower.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.760]   It's a little few to it.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.720]   Really responds to when you want to do it and when you want to think quickly or slowly,
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   it's really good.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.960]   Richard, what do you like about this phone?
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.720]   Given that you've probably done the most in-depth review of anybody here so far makes it for
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.720]   Ryan.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.360]   Well, perhaps I've had the least sleep as well.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.840]   So I've been with you on that.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.360]   We love the audio quality.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.600]   The design of the thing is just beautiful.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.400]   I put this next to a trail this morning and it was like, "Oh, yeah."
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.400]   Look, this and the trail was just like, "You don't want to go back to the other phones anymore."
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.280]   I mean, the interface is just really, it's just very simple.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   It's very Apple.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.040]   It just works in the way it goes.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.960]   I love the photo library, as you said.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.720]   I love the browser.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.320]   I hate browsing.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.800]   The browser itself, the software is really good and I like it.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   It works very well.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   It works very well.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   It's intuitive and simple.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.960]   It's kind of like Firefox in that approach and it just works very well.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:20.640]   It's very smart in the sense that once you get a page loaded, which does take a while,
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.240]   but when you double tap on something, it knows how wide it is, whether it's text or picture,
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.640]   and zooms just to fit that object.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:28.640]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.120]   It's just intuitive, but it's just actually said the problem is you have to, you know,
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.960]   you want to go to the New York Times or wirelesshinfo.com and it takes you five minutes to get that.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:37.960]   Good plug.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.960]   Thank you.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.600]   He's good, isn't he?
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.040]   You get the Devorak Award for this stealthiest.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.040]   It's stealthiest plug.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.200]   Okay, how about you, Veronica?
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.400]   What do you like about this phone?
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:53.760]   Well, I was really shocked and amazed that it did work the way I wanted it to as soon as
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.720]   I started using them here.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.800]   You know, like Callie said, we've seen all the commercials, we've seen how it's supposed
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:04.000]   to work, but then actually having it in your hand and looking the way it does is very surprising
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.600]   for someone who's used so many gadgets before.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.200]   My favorite thing is probably Google Maps.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:14.800]   I really like the Google Maps app and I like getting directions and I think it's very cute.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.320]   Have you not used that though on another phone?
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.720]   I mean, as far as I can tell, exactly the same as the Google Maps on my BlackBerry.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.640]   My phone, my version of the dash is an earlier version that doesn't have Java built in, so
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.080]   I haven't used Google Maps on a phone before.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.240]   So it's kind of exciting for me.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.680]   I know other people are probably used to that, but I think the integration with the iPhone
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.680]   is really great.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.520]   Well, yeah, you can't touch Google Maps on any other phone.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.520]   No, no.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.800]   I respect your right.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.120]   And the edge connection does kind of blow.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.840]   But other than that, it's got its ups and downs.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.440]   We'll get to what blows in a second.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.600]   Let's ask Ryan Block of Engadget.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.480]   And probably with Richard, you probably spent the most time on this thing.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.560]   What is it that you like best about it?
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.680]   Well, I think that there's a long list of things to like about the phone and probably
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.080]   equally long list of things not to like.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:07.280]   So, I mean, it's hard to start off and I guess go through it.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:12.120]   But I mean, as far as devices go, it almost doesn't even need to be said, but it's beautifully
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   designed.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.480]   It's really one of the most attractive pieces of consumer electronics out there.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   But it's slippery.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.480]   There's nothing to hold on to, so get a case.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.480]   Right.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:27.880]   I mean, this is this kind of level of attractiveness doesn't really matter to some people.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   And that's fine.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.080]   But to me, aesthetics do matter somewhat.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.320]   It's not, no amount of aesthetics is ever going to make up for a terrible device.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.920]   And I think we all know that.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.800]   And I would never let that pass.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:41.280]   But it is a very well designed device.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.720]   And you know, it's well designed on the inside as it is on the outside in general terms.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.960]   So I can give them props for that.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.360]   It feels really good in the hand.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.000]   It feels really good up against the ear.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.880]   And that's not something that every well designed device is.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.480]   I mean, you know, I've seen pretty phones that are just really not very comfortable
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   to hold.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.360]   So I mean, that's something simple usability, things like that.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:07.440]   And you know, just going through and interacting with the device, I mean, it definitely has
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.240]   its own feel and it has its own design sensibility about it.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:18.120]   And I mean, even if you don't like Apple, even if you don't like the iPhone, I think
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.240]   it's really hard to deny the fact this has really kind of changed the game for cell
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.920]   phones and raised the bar for human usability and mobile devices.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.240]   I like the mute switch.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.640]   There are a few phones I've had that have had that, the BlackBerry had one, but that's
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.440]   just every phone that I have that.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.680]   Speaking as a broadcaster, that's a must.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.680]   Yeah, that's a great feature.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.680]   I like that too.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.480]   The controls that are on it seem to work quite well.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.520]   The home button surprised me how much I had to press it.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.960]   I thought it's the most mechanical thing on the phone.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.600]   The on/off switch works very, very cool.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.120]   Yeah, there's a lot.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:59.640]   There is absolutely in its industrial design, it's superb.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.960]   And I think it's a breakthrough in terms of user interface.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:08.240]   I mean, one of the, I mean, look, it's well understood how to make a cell phone.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:12.360]   What's been a consistent problem for every manufacturer is how to make a portable computer,
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.560]   how to make a small handheld computer.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:22.000]   And I think this touch interface is a very good deal of the way towards solving that
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   problem.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.200]   It's not there yet, but I think it's a good way towards it.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.120]   All right, now it's time for the bitch fest.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.080]   I'll give you each a couple things.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.240]   Who wants to start Veronica?
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.360]   Is there anything you don't like about this thing?
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.000]   Well, like I said, the edge connection is just, I think David Pogue put it best where
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.440]   he said the Wi-Fi was like fast and wonderful in the cellular data was slow and horrible.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.720]   And it is pretty slow and horrible.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.880]   I mean, it wasn't horrible, might be a little strong.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:57.400]   I mean, like some things were coming up pretty quickly, but other things were very laggy and
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.560]   it just took a while to browse.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:04.280]   That's my main complaint because I do like to use the web on the go quite a bit.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.340]   And that's going to be kind of a an icky point for me in the future.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.780]   We should point out though that it's no slower on the iPhone than it is on any other AT&T
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:11.780]   device.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.300]   It's just that Verizon and Sprint have much faster networks.
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.260]   And you expect a little bit better.
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.260]   Even AT&T, that's right.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.660]   Why does it support HSDPA?
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:26.020]   Well, we can go to the reason why, but that's not really the point.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:30.140]   All right, Ryan, what are a couple of negatives from your point of view?
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:34.060]   Well, you know, I'll try not to speak to the general lack of specs.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:40.860]   For example, HTTP and GPS and the inability to send MS and record video and these things.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.460]   I'm not going to speak to those bits.
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:45.860]   Although that was a good list, I think.
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.100]   I think it just kind of did.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.060]   That list goes on and on and on.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.460]   I'm not going to go on into that list.
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.860]   But I will say thus far, I've been a little bit unimpressed with the keyboard.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:59:00.060]   I still hold strongly the fact that as human beings, we need a certain level of tactile
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.900]   and haptic feedback with the devices that we use.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:07.260]   So having virtual keyboard, even though you get used to it, it's never really the same
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:12.300]   as having a keyboard you can feel and click on and actually know that you're typing with.
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:16.180]   And I don't feel that you should have to trust a device and trust that you're inputting things.
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.180]   I agree.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.180]   I think that you should just know.
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.020]   It's not a matter of trust.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.060]   It's a matter of knowing for me.
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:26.060]   So the keyboard, even if I grow to like it and I'm not there yet, I think that I'm always
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:30.180]   not going to ever like it as much as a regular and proper keyboard.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.500]   The lack of 3G for me is a really big deal.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.580]   The edge is fast, but it's just not fast enough.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.700]   And the Wi-Fi is just not, it's a joke.
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:42.500]   I mean, it does work well when it works, but the fact that Steve Jobs actually expects
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.420]   you to leave the house and start connecting with Wi-Fi around town.
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:46.860]   I mean, there's no handoff.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.900]   You can't be on the move when you're doing it.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:53.140]   You have to be sitting in a spot directly underneath some guy's open router, which is
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:56.580]   not even very common anymore in order to get haunting you there and access.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:59.780]   It shouldn't be a real common usage scenario.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.540]   I think that's kind of a little bit out of the question for most people.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:07.020]   Maybe I should reframe this and you've already done it.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:11.420]   But for the next rest of you, maybe what is it that people who buy this phone are going
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:16.500]   to be disappointed by or surprised by or maybe somebody should keep in mind before they buy
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.500]   the phone?
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.500]   Richard, how about you?
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.300]   Well, the browsing is the main thing, I guess, the speed, but we've already covered that a
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.860]   little, I guess.
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.940]   The camera, I was a little disappointed.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.060]   It's okay.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.700]   I was kind of had a hope that if anybody could sort out a really good cell phone camera,
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:37.900]   it would be Apple and their expertise in engineering, small, good cameras, but they
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.900]   didn't.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.900]   It's just all right.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.220]   That's a little disappointing to me.
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.900]   There's no other settings with it.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.900]   There's no settings.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:44.900]   There's no zoom.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.980]   There's no white balance.
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.620]   There's no aperture control.
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.620]   There's nothing.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:53.340]   But I think in the day, the camera really reminds us that Apple is still constrained by
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.380]   the same technological shortcomings as every other company out there.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:00.340]   But wait, am I in 95 as a 5 megapixel camera wins?
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.340]   Right.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.340]   But your N95 is also much thicker.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:06.500]   I'm talking about, you know, if you have a fat image sensor, a really nice, large image
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.300]   sensor made with something with autofocus and some good optics that's going to add some
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.740]   girth to the phone.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.060]   And that's not something they wanted to do.
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.140]   They wanted to use a very small image sensor with a very small lens.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.500]   And in doing so, they sacrificed image quality on the camera.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.380]   I mean, they're not miracle workers.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.380]   They are working with regular technology.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.140]   I think that's what you're remembering.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.140]   You're right, Ryan.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:32.340]   And this also reminds us that, you know, even inside this cool stylish design, it's pretty
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.340]   standard components.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.060]   There really isn't anything that radical in terms of the hardware.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.900]   I mean, the other thing I was a little disappointed while we just got some results on the battery
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:46.660]   testing, we got about four hours, three minutes out of the talk time, which isn't great.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:47.820]   It's not bad.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.820]   But you know, you're always critical.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:53.700]   But if you, but of course you always divide manufacturers numbers in half.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:58.140]   Is it comparable to, it seems like it's still better than the other smartphones in the market?
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.140]   It depends.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.620]   I mean, it's pretty much exactly the same as what we got with the ocean.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:05.380]   But it's a little bit less than an Nokia, but it's like half of what we got out the
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.380]   BlackBerry 8800.
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:10.820]   You know, the BlackBerry 8800 kept going for like 10 hours.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.300]   So it's acceptable.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:17.860]   It would be nice if it was a little bit longer, but you know, that's a little disappointing.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.860]   But you know, we live about that.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.860]   It's not as bad as we thought it would be.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.820]   And I have to say it's my Nokia 95 will drain it.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.380]   You look at it, it'll drain the battery.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:27.300]   So it's better than the one.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.940]   I have to say the camera, one thing I liked about the camera and maybe I've heard others
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.820]   have not had this experience is it's fast.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.860]   I mean, I can get from off to a picture in a second or two.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.740]   And there's not a lot of camera phones that can do that.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.020]   I mean, we found it very quick to do it.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:45.020]   It's not very quick in terms of taking one shot after the other.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.020]   It was very slow at that.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.020]   Interesting.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.020]   I haven't tried that.
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.020]   I mean, we test all this stuff.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.820]   You know, we do digital cameras all the time.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.820]   Right.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.700]   The clock standby to first shot was very quick.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.060]   That was 2.43 seconds.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:01.460]   But the shots a shot time was about one and a half frame to second, which is just really
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.460]   slow, even for a cell phone.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.460]   Image quality is decent.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.340]   It's two megapixels is but it's not bad.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:10.220]   I have quite a few images now on Flickr that I've been taking and I've been pretty happy
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.220]   with it.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.580]   Low light is pretty bad.
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.580]   You have to have a lot of light.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.580]   I did these all outside.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.380]   But I mean, the cell phone cameras always have a problem with low light because they're
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   sensors.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.380]   Right.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.380]   It's not about camera.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.940]   Callie Lewis, you have only had it for 15 minutes.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:32.140]   So I said, it's a little early to come up with a negative, but go ahead.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:36.140]   See if you can come up with something you don't like about it.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:40.060]   Well, it's got the actual experience.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:43.260]   The keyboard I had a little bit of an issue with and the camera, it took me a while to
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.260]   get something I was happy for my wallpaper.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:50.980]   But I think my main issue, because I haven't, you know, I haven't played with the iPhone,
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:55.220]   my main issues that I feel like I've made a deal with the devil with the AT&T.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.220]   Right.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.060]   So, I mean, that's my big.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.820]   And you don't have a choice and you won't have a choice for five years.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.020]   I mean, unless Apple decides to break their deal.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.260]   Hey, Callie, if you ever decide that you don't want to use an iPhone anymore, at least
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.900]   you're still locked into a carrier contract with somebody who does have 3G.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.940]   So you could switch over to another phone if you wanted to, you know, put up a Windows
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.940]   mobile or something.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:15.940]   Good point.
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:20.380]   Not that anyone would ever, not that I think anyone would ever switch from an iPhone
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.380]   to Windows mobile.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:22.780]   If they did, you could at least get 3G.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:26.180]   Where is HSDPA implemented on the AT&T network?
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.180]   Is it in all the major?
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.740]   It's not in all the major cities.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.260]   I mean, it's not in LA yet, but it is in a number of major cities.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.260]   It's in the Bay Area.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.900]   So, I mean, I use it frequently and it does have very good speeds.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:40.780]   I have EVDO on both the Bryson and Sprint and HSDPA on singular.
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:42.460]   And it's very comparable.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.940]   It's not quite as good, but it's up there.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:45.940]   Compromole, yeah.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.180]   I can understand that.
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.380]   Really everyone's experience with their customer service?
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.460]   Right.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.460]   We don't know yet.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.060]   You're the only one who's really had to deal with them.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.860]   I have to say that when it was singular, it was awful.
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.500]   They were among the worst.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.700]   Yeah, but Verizon, I've had nothing but nightmare experiences as well.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.700]   Really?
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.060]   And I've had some pretty poor experiences with Sprint too.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.900]   So, I mean, they're all pretty bad.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:12.260]   They all could do a lesson from, you know, somebody much more talented than themselves
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.260]   in.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.260]   I don't know, T-Mobile is really good.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.140]   Yeah, I see T-Mobile leads it away there.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.140]   They're overly polite, if anything.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.140]   Yeah, they have a very sensitive, very sensitive.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:24.500]   They have the least amount of customers, so they try harder.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.500]   Maybe that's it.
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.180]   You're not leaving us, right?
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.180]   It is.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.460]   Well, I kept my T-Mobile phone.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.780]   So, I've got both the T-Mobile.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.780]   Don't worry.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.900]   You've got at least one customer here.
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.180]   I have to say, I was a little disappointed with the way we get the pictures out of the
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.180]   phone.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.220]   Now, it's fine that it syncs up if you're using a Mac.
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.420]   It'll sync up an iPhoto.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:48.860]   I presume on Windows it would do the same thing with iTunes and Adobe Photoshop album or whatever
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.940]   of programs the iTunes supports.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:56.140]   But if you want to get out of the phone before you get home, there's only one choice and
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.380]   that's to email it.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:03.100]   And it emails it, at least at the test, I did it at 640x480, not original size.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.100]   Maybe you can change that.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.060]   I haven't found a way to do that.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:08.460]   And it strips out all the exit information.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.900]   So it's really a phone where you take a picture and you take it home.
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:17.180]   And of course you can't do anything by an MSR that you can see.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:18.180]   Oh, MMS.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:20.180]   I was surprised though.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:24.460]   Some of my viewers said the fact that you can't do MMS was a deal breaker for them.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:25.460]   Absolutely.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.020]   Outside of everything else, that was the deal breaker.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.020]   Absolutely.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.020]   I feel that way too.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.500]   Now, again, these things could be fixed either by third party applications or by firmware
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.500]   update.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:38.420]   And it's, I think, not at all unlikely that Apple will respond to some of these.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.420]   But it's just something we should point out.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:43.700]   And I think the most important thing is to point out to prospective customers, everybody's
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.700]   got different issues.
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.940]   Everybody's got different deal breakers.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.580]   If MMS is important to you, you need to know that it doesn't do MMS.
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:50.580]   For some people, that's a big deal.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:51.580]   I don't care about that.
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:56.180]   So it's just, I think that's why it's important to read the reviews at wirelessinfo.com and
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.180]   gajit.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.580]   And frankly, I look forward to seeing PC World has a pretty good effect.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.620]   They've done a very good job in 24 hours on the iPhone.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:08.060]   For the record, CNET also has a full review up with video as well.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:12.860]   They're very good and PC Mag and I think that's where I, that's what I didn't like about
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:15.140]   the big four getting the iPhone two weeks early.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.980]   That's not enough people to really get a good sense of it.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:22.020]   And I want to see what the real professional reviewers do, not what Stephen Levy and Walt
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:26.580]   Mossberg do because with all due respect, those guys are great.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.060]   But that's not their bread and butter.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.020]   And which could possibly be why they got the iPhone first.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.740]   Oh, in the red thing.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.740]   I think.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:37.900]   I'm staying out of this one.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:38.900]   I'm a wise man.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.900]   So it's like British expression.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.180]   Do you mind thinking that I couldn't possibly comment?
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.820]   I couldn't possibly say.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.700]   Well the good news is nobody listens to this podcast.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.700]   So you're safe.
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:54.740]   Although I do want to note that David Polk did have twit on his iPhone in his video and
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.780]   I'm going to say he was listening to it.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.660]   In fact, the album art was really, really old.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.660]   So I noticed that.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.740]   I noticed that it was a, the twit was on there.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.180]   I said, David, you can get a newer copy.
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:07.260]   We actually do them every week now.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:13.660]   All right, let's talk, let's wrap this thing up really with the grand philosophy.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.820]   What does the iPhone mean in the scheme of things?
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:22.140]   Does it change everything in the way that the iPod changed an industry or is it not
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.300]   such a big deal?
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.340]   Let's start with you, Ryan.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.340]   How important is this?
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:33.180]   Well, I mean, the iPod came in at a time when nobody was using digital audio player.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:37.220]   There was no market there and the iPod kind of defined that market and opened it up.
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.500]   It made it mainstream.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:42.500]   And now there's a huge digital audio player market and everybody else can play in that
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   market.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.020]   You know, Microsoft and Zoom and iRiver and all these other guys have their units out
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.660]   there because in part Apple really opened that up.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.140]   Now Apple is late to the game this time.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:57.100]   The iPhone is coming into a market that's already been really well established.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.540]   Billions of phones of ship.
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.900]   So they really have to make a mark.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:05.980]   They're not going to do something new for phones in making the mainstream or whatever.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.900]   I mean, everybody already has a phone.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:12.060]   What they're doing and I mentioned this earlier is they're kind of changing the paradigm
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:16.460]   for usability in portable computing devices, changing the paradigm for usability in cell
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.460]   phones.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:18.620]   That's what this is really all about.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:24.300]   It's about making cell phones both powerful and easy and not those two things, you know,
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.700]   having those two things being mutually exclusive.
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.340]   Calli Lewis, what do you think?
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.940]   I think it's important in a big way.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:35.180]   I mean, this is technology consumers have never been able to get their hands on.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.860]   Of course it's big and it's important.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.380]   We've got Microsoft Surface with multi-touch.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.380]   Come on.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.580]   It's just a big ass cable, please.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:50.820]   Now that I've actually played with the iPhone, it's so clear what a me-to job that was.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:56.580]   Well, I mean, you know, it's just I'll be interested to see what comes out of all this
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:01.180]   and Will Apple be willing to license their proprietary stuff.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.180]   You're right.
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.140]   I think they've added the hell out of this.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.140]   I don't think they own this.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.140]   No, they don't own multi-touch.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.140]   I mean, we should be clear about that.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.100]   They do not own multi-touch.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.100]   Who owns multi-touch?
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.660]   There is no ownership of multi-touch.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:19.020]   It's been something that's been in universities and in academia and computer science for decades.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.020]   It's not a new concept.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.820]   It's been around for a really long time.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:26.140]   This is just one of the first instances that's ever actually been commercialized for consumer
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:27.140]   use.
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.140]   Right.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.260]   Jeff Hahn, really, if anybody owns it, but I don't think he's patented it.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:36.500]   It is that Jeff Hahn's pinch thing, though, the thing that we saw it Ted, and it's clearly
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.860]   that and it's on the surface.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.860]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.860]   It's slated.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.460]   I'm sure they patented everything they could, but they couldn't patent that.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.460]   That's interesting.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.460]   Veronica, what do you think?
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.180]   Well, I think if it goes over as well as I think it's going to go, a lot of different
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:52.220]   cell phone manufacturers are going to be coming out with devices that, you know, do implement
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:54.220]   the touch screen more frequently.
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:59.540]   I mean, we've already seen the LG Prada and we've seen the HTC Touch and a lot of different
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:04.500]   phones that have much bigger screens and interfaces that act a lot like the iPhone,
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.020]   even if they've come out before the iPhone did.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:11.660]   So I think it's really going to bring a new era in user interface and usability to the
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:14.260]   cell phone market.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:18.220]   And finally, let's go to Richard Bagley from wirelessinfo.com.
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.900]   Well, thank you for the plug.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:27.180]   I mean, I really agree with Veronica that this, in terms of the device itself, the hardware
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.380]   isn't revolutionary.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:33.340]   It's the approach to how you do things and how you perform the tasks that everybody does
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:34.740]   with a cell phone, which is interesting thing.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.580]   And I very much hope that this will make the other guys think, hey, it's not just a question
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:41.460]   of stuffing 15,000 features into a cell phone.
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:44.860]   It's a question of looking at how you use that thing and how people really want to get
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.580]   the stuff done that they want to do.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.980]   You know, it's interesting and nobody said it, but I'll say it.
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:52.540]   This is clearly the best iPod ever made.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:58.260]   And if you took the phone out and just ignored it, it's probably still worth the price for
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:59.260]   an amazing iPod.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.260]   I just wish you that.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:01.260]   I don't know if I would say that.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.260]   No, you don't think so.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.740]   No, I gotta say, even though the iPod did kind of change the game for portable audio,
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.460]   I've never really been a big iPod fan.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.460]   Oh, interesting.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:11.220]   And even though it does work really well, I mean, the music integration is great and
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:15.140]   having an integrated calls and music fades out and fades back in and you have that little
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.140]   body.
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.140]   Cover flow and that.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.380]   Yeah, I mean, all that stuff works really great.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.260]   I will definitely test that.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:25.860]   But I mean, that whole end of the spectrum of the device, that is not what makes this
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.860]   thing for me.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.860]   Interesting.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:33.460]   And it just all of all of these components put together and not just, you know, the fact
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.460]   that it's a great iPod.
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.340]   And I know that you really wanted to do that.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:40.900]   I do agree that it is a fantastic iPod and I think we'll probably be seeing an iPod that
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:45.380]   is just a standalone iPod that works this way, you know, probably by the holidays.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.620]   And that's going to kill me because, you know, it's going to be an 80 gigabyte version
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.820]   of this probably for the same amount that I paid for the iPhone.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.820]   But Ryan's right.
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:56.020]   It is the mashup of the phone with the player and everything else involved that makes it
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:57.020]   a great device.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:03.260]   I just, I think, you know, it's maybe it's because I said nobody listens to music on their
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:04.260]   phone.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.260]   The music isn't important.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.300]   Forget that before this came out.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.580]   And now here I am thinking, I love this iPod.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:15.860]   I mean, I was listening to it all the way in and it's the phone.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:18.220]   The phone is fine, but it's a great iPod.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.180]   I'd love to have any headphones that work with it yet.
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:24.300]   Now, can without activating it, can you use it as an iPod?
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.820]   And I think you have to activate it before you can use the features.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.380]   You can do anything without the device, with the device without activating.
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:33.020]   You can do absolutely nothing except making emergency calls.
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:37.940]   And I would also point out that you cannot attach it to any other copy of iTunes.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:42.460]   Once you choose the iTunes, the machine you're activating on, I wasn't able to get any other
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.660]   iTunes to even recognize it.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.060]   And that's kind of a bummer.
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.980]   Well, you might have to do a software reset, but that's kind of the same thing that happens
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:51.300]   with your iPod if you have a iPod.
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.620]   No, I could plug the iPod into another one and said, oh, this guy is attached to another
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.620]   machine.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.460]   And I think everything, this didn't even see it.
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:59.260]   It doesn't even show up.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.220]   I think there's a way you can do that.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:04.540]   I think if you do a full reset, I think you can still do it.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.020]   Start over like it's a brand new phone.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.020]   Do I have to ask you?
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.020]   Right.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.100]   But I mean, the point I'm making is if you did do that, if it did have the same unexpected
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:17.700]   behavior as an iPod had, you basically have to, you know, erase it in order to start using
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.620]   it on another machine and thinking with that content.
[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:21.700]   Yeah, but that's fine.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.700]   I just want to make sure that I could at least do that much.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.940]   But it didn't seem like I could.
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:26.940]   So that's good to know.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.380]   I'll have to try reset.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.540]   How do you reset this thing?
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.540]   It's in the option.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.220]   You can actually drill down into the option there.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:36.500]   So I got full phone reset, you know, restart a factory default mode.
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.460]   Oh, well, that doesn't sound good.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.180]   I'm not sure I really want to do that.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:43.180]   Okay.
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.020]   I'm not trying it out.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.540]   I haven't finished all review yet.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.020]   Yeah, I'll save that for after when I give it to my daughter.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:52.060]   That's when she'll, she can, she can do that.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.980]   Well, I want to thank you all for joining us.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:57.220]   Remind you, of course, that this podcast has all our Twitch podcasts.
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:03.220]   It was brought to you by audible.com, a chance for you to get an absolutely free book just
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.980]   by going to audible.com/twit, a free audio book.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:07.980]   You can try it out.
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:12.700]   Give you an idea of what it's like to listen to audible books on your new iPhone if you
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:13.700]   should.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:17.260]   So choose a every, we traditionally recommend a book.
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.900]   And I didn't prepare you guys.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.100]   So I won't spring it on you.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:24.260]   But I think I have an appropriate book for people who are iPhone users.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:29.300]   You might want to read I was, see, Wozniak's autobiography, how I invented the personal
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.420]   computer and had fun along the way.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.020]   I actually have that as an audible.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.020]   Do you?
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.020]   Yes, I do.
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.020]   Well, there you go.
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.020]   And you're listening to it?
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.500]   I listened to it several months ago, probably six months ago.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.500]   And what do you think?
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.500]   It was a good book.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.500]   It was cute.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.500]   I've heard all his stories.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.700]   So I kind of know what's in the book and Gina Smith's a good friend.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.340]   So I haven't, I haven't actually downloaded it yet, but I think I'll get it.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:50.740]   But certainly Woz is the guy.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:55.060]   And to see somebody like Woz show up at Valley Fair Mall and sit on a bench and wait for
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:56.060]   his iPhone.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.060]   He's a good person.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.060]   He's just a good man.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.060]   I think.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.060]   I have it in my library.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.700]   I can't wait to listen to it.
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:02.700]   Good.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:03.700]   All right.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.700]   Well, there's our free book.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:09.100]   And I got three recommendations now that is audible.com/twit.
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.100]   We thank so much.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.740]   We thank Audible so much for the support of the Twit Network.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:16.780]   We really appreciate Audible.com/twit for your free audio book.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.780]   Well, I can't thank you all enough.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:22.540]   Really did have the royalty of gadgetry on with us today.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.180]   And it's been really great.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.180]   I hope you all come back.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:31.740]   Ryan Block is the editor in chief of Engagit, E-N-G-A-D-G-E-T.com or something like that.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.740]   Did I spell it right?
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.180]   I thought that's about right.
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:39.220]   If you type it into Google, you'll get an autocorrect for it.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:42.180]   I think I was in the ballpark anyway.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.940]   I absolutely read it religiously every day and it's just fantastic.
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.540]   I'm so glad we could get you on the show, Ryan.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:48.540]   Thanks, Matt.
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:49.540]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:52.380]   Callie Lewis is with geekbrief.tv.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:56.220]   Just a wonderful video podcast about gadgetry four times a week.
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.700]   And make sure you watch 192 where she rails about her data plan.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.700]   Or you can just move on.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.700]   Rails about her.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.700]   How did I have an iPhone?
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.500]   Are you going to now do one about the iPhone?
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.660]   I think so.
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:09.660]   I think maybe.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.340]   I think I have to.
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.900]   I think we've got you coming up to Vancouver to do the TV show.
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:16.900]   So good.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:17.900]   Yeah, in August.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.020]   I will save a Twit hoodie for you.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.740]   We've got our new fleece hoodies and they're beautiful.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:22.740]   I love one.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.180]   And I'm bringing Drobo.
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.180]   Are you?
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:26.180]   Good.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.180]   You better you than me.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.180]   I'm not bringing Drobo across the border.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:29.540]   Well, I may have it sent off.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:34.820]   Is this a data robot?
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:40.020]   Also Veronica Belmont from Buzz Out Loud, my favorite tech news podcast.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.420]   She just slumming here with us on Twit.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.420]   And seenettv.com.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.820]   So good to talk to you again.
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:46.820]   Thank you.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:51.540]   And to our newbie in the bunch, Richard Bagley, who Baguly, Baguly, Baguly, Baguly, Baguly.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.540]   Baguly.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.500]   One of these days, you know, usually takes me, I don't know, Veronica will tell you.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.740]   It takes me about seven or eight episodes.
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.740]   Then I get your name, right?
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.740]   I've heard all variations.
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.380]   I'll put more in and out of there.
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.980]   Wirelessinfo.com is an excellent, excellent.
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:10.020]   In fact, it's probably the best in terms of just raw information and absolute editorial
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:14.420]   integrity, cell phone review site, wirelessinfo.com.
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:21.060]   Out of the family, you've heard me talk before about camcorderinfo.com and digitalcamerainfo.com.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:23.100]   This is the newest wirelessinfo.com.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.100]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.460]   I look forward to reading your full review as soon as we get off the air here.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.460]   It's my pleasure.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.540]   I might take an hour or two to sleep and then I'll finish it up.
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.620]   Go back to sleep.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.620]   Thank you all.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:36.420]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:43.420]   I should have paid attention.
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:50.420]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:57.420]   Too much work.
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:05.420]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.420]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   So here's the deal.
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:13.140]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a ton of blue screens like
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.140]   forget it.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:15.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:18.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:21.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:22.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:23.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:29.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:32.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:35.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.140]   I'm killing you.
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:45.140]   I'm killing you.
